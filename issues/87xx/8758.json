I've seen at least one project thinking that `target-confirmations` means \"filter to only show transactions of n target-confirmations\". It's a weird param but I'd document it as\r\n\r\n> target-confirmations: (numeric, optional) Return the hash of the block that has target-confirmations of confirmations, for use in a further call to listsincblock\r\n",
