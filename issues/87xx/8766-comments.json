Not sure such a thing exists though, it came up before, and I don't think anyone could find one.\r\n\r\n> (although arguably one should obtain the checksum info from the ISO source).\r\n\r\nAdding the checksum here is an extra safety step. If you only get that information from the same source as where you get the iso there's the possibility that both have been MITMed.\r\n\r\nWhat could work is, if debian signs the release ISOs with the same GPG key every time, is mention the fingerprint of that key instead, how to get it, and how to verify the ISO.\r\n\r\nEdit: though for major releases the user shouldn't be told to grab it automatically. Unless Debian 9 has been extensively tested and cleared for this use, we want Debian 8.\r\n",
