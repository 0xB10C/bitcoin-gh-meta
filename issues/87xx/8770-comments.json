      "body" : "What's the problem here? 0x21 isn't an OP code, its a size identifier. Are you suggesting that it is supposed to interpret your bare multisig (non standard BTW) as just a normal p2pkh address? Because it doesn't and it won't, it will assume that the data you are pushing are blobs of data (not any sort of key, that comes later). Because this is some script, it will interpret the address as a p2sh address.",
