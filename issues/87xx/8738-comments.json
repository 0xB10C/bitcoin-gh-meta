Bitcoin Core verifies simultaneously with downloading, avoiding the need for double storage and needing to wait for the download to complete before starting to validate. That verification can be sped up a lot if you can assign more memory to the database cache as @jonasschelli mentioned.\n\n10 days does sound extremely long though.

Perhaps a particular attack exists on the network that managed to interfere with your download process. Perhaps there is a bug in the download logic.
