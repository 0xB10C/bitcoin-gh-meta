      "body" : "I like the concept of an external app working on `wallet.dat` files. I know several use cases where you have many `wallet.dat` files and with this, you can remove all the notes around the files you have to select between them.\r\n\r\nI can even imagine removing/deprecating `encryptwallet`, `walletpassphrasechange` and such from `bitcoind` afterwards.\r\n\r\nWe have to take care of proper file locking when working on the file when `bitcoind` is running at the same time.\r\n\r\nSome travis' hosts do not build (wallet/nowallet configs?).",
