If you're a node running with a small mempool, then transactions can be evicted even if they're not \"low feerate\".\r\n\r\nI tend to think we should not be turning nodes with small mempools into DoSers; so if we solve that problem first (eg by making the peer receiving a NOTFOUND be able to find the transaction elsewhere in a reasonable amount of time), then I think we could go ahead and remove mapRelay and only serve things from our mempool.  We should go ahead and fix the privacy problem (mentioned in #14220) at the same time though.",

But imagine flooding the network with tx_A, so that everybody announces is to an attacker and an attacker now can query for it. \r\nThen in 30 seconds, when everyone does have tx_A, we selectively announce tx_B  (which is an RBF to tx_A and will evict tx_A from the mempool) to **node_victim**. And start querying for **tx_A** persistently. Whoever responds with ``NOTFOUND`` received tx_B, which means that node was closer to **node_victim**.\r\n\r\nStuff like diffusion, [previous PR addressing the problem](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14220) and **this** proposal would prevent us from inferring tx_A or tx_B relay patterns directly, but they can easily be deduced by querying for tx_A. \r\n\r\nSo, the cost of an attack is increased from ``1 tx`` to ``1 tx + 1 RBF``, which does not really address the goal.\r\n\r\nMy immediate solutions:\r\n#### Crazy expensive but fundamental\r\nKeep responding about tx_A even when it's replaced with tx_B.\r\nThis would require storing tx_A while we know. Afaik this is very opposite to the current intuition we implement in the codebase.\r\n\r\n#### Less expensive but limited\r\nAllow at most 1 (or 2 just in case) queries per transaction. So that tx_A can be requested by every node at most once. \r\nIn this case, an attacker would have to run more nodes or spend do more double-spends. Not ideal, but at least something.\r\nIt would also require a data structure like a bloom filter to track our past responses.\r\n\r\nMaybe this should be implemented as a follow-up PR, I might do that sometime.",
