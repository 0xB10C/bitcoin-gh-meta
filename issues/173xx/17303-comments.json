If you're a node running with a small mempool, then transactions can be evicted even if they're not \"low feerate\".\r\n\r\nI tend to think we should not be turning nodes with small mempools into DoSers; so if we solve that problem first (eg by making the peer receiving a NOTFOUND be able to find the transaction elsewhere in a reasonable amount of time), then I think we could go ahead and remove mapRelay and only serve things from our mempool.  We should go ahead and fix the privacy problem (mentioned in #14220) at the same time though.",
