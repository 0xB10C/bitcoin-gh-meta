No need to maintain our own hacky one, anymore\r\n- The configuration system changed. Upstream now builds using CMake. This doesn't mean we need to use that (phew), but I had to define different flags as before (no more `-DOS_WINDOWS` and such but specific flags).\r\n\r\nAll changes: https://github.com/google/leveldb/compare/a53934a3ae1244679f812d998a4f16f2c7f309a6...master\r\n\r\nPretty much all our changes have been subsumed by upstream, so we figured it was cleaner to start over with a new branch from upstream with the still-relevant patches applied: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb/tree/bitcoin-fork-new\r\n\r\nThere's quite some testing to be done (especially on WIndows). See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb/issues/25 and https://github.com/bitcoin-core/leveldb/pull/26 for more history and context.",
