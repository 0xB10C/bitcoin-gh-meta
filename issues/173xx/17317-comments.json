      "body" : "I think the \"Can I work on this?\" is also about \"reserving\" the issue. As a new contributor who is doing this after hours, it could take several days to do something that a seasoned contributor could do in <1h, so there could be a fear they start with something that is already solved when they are done. But everyone has to start somewhere so this is ok. I would actually encourage first-timers to indicate they are working on something and report more on their progress if they are stuck, so I like encouraging them to ask for help. I can imagine that sometimes it seems like a lack of effort when they are actually just overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nI also like the \"Requirement\" as a hint of what skills could be useful so that newcomers don't dive into something that turns out to be too complicated for them. However, I would frame it a little softer as something like: \"It would be very helpful if you have experience with...\".\r\n\r\nActually, the main skill lacking in new contributors that I have seen (in my short time) was using Git properly. Since there are sections on that in contributing.md I would include it as well.",
