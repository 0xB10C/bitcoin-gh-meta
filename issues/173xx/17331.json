Since fees are taken into account during the selection itself, we finally get rid of the `CreateTransaction` loop as well as a few other things that only were only necessary because of that loop.\r\n\r\nThis should not change coin selection behavior at all (except maybe remove weird edge cases that were caused by the loop). In order to keep behavior the same, `KnapsackSolver` will select outputs with a negative effective value (as it did before).\r\n\r\nRequire #17290 ",
