      "body" : "In this interface the function may or may not add the second argument to the first and it does not signal to the caller which one of the two it did. I find this puzzling. Surely the caller needs to take a different action depending on whether the two numbers can be summed or not? If the caller does not care and takes the same action either way, and the code is still correct, then why bother and not just skip calling `MaybeAdd()` altogether? (if not adding is also ok)\r\n\r\nOr, if this is used in some kind of blurred logic where everything is ok, is it not better for the sum to produce `numeric_limits<T>::max()` in case of an overflow? E.g. if summing `char` `100 + 30` to produce `127` instead of `100`?\r\n\r\nTo me it would be more logical to check for an overflow and take the appropriate action if one would occur, even if that is to `abort()` the program. We have types that are wide enough to ensure that overflow \"never\" occurs, or if it occurs then `abort()`ing is justified. Something like:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ntemplate <typename T>\r\nT SumOrDie(T x, T y)\r\n{\r\n    assert(!AddOverflows(x, y));\r\n    assert(!AddUnderflows(x, y));\r\n    return x + y;\r\n}",
