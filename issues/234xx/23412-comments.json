      "body" : "A proof of concept video how `*notify` option can be exploited for Windows users:\r\n\r\n1. Since the shortcut for testnet that is created by default has a config parameter for `-testnet` it will be easy to convince victim that similar options can be used for mainnet\r\n2. Which `*notify` will the attacker use? Depends on the victim or things attacker is trying to achieve. We are anyway providing different config params which can be used as required.\r\n3. In this PoC I have used `-startupnotify` as an example which open mspaint when `bitcoin-qt` starts.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/142024313-b48934f1-230e-4e45-82e5-f9e261f8e3dd.mp4\r\n\r\nOther ways to use these config params effectively:\r\n\r\n- Use combination of parameters. Example: `-startupnotify` will be used for sending an email  about new victim and start reverse shell, `-walletnotify` sends an email so that attacker knows victim's wallet is doing some transactions and `-shutdownnotify` to send notification email that victim is no longer using `bitcoin-qt`\r\n\r\n- Use config parameter based on victim. Example: Alice (victim) is searching online for some help regarding notifications about her wallet transactions. In this case, Bob(attacker) can help him using `-walletnotify` config parameter\r\n\r\n- Use config parameter based on attack. Example: `-walletnotify` will be more helpful when trying to convince victims for an airdrop that requires wallet registration\r\n\r\n- Some websites already sell [`wallet.dat`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/77#issuecomment-721927922) files to scam users. They can do more than just scamming by asking users to use one of the config parameter for using the wallet file.\r\n\r\nWhy is this different from just asking victims to run any random command?\r\n\r\n- We should not underestimate social engineering.\r\n- All the config parameters are documented in this repository and different websites with no security recommendations. Easier to convince victims that these are legit options.\r\n- A newbie can be convinced to run `bitcoin-qt -*notify=X` however he might not run just `X` or other ways to run multiple commands in different terminals.\r\n- Bitcoin has no official support or website so everyone learns things from different places\r\n- All options provided in Bitcoin Core or Knots are considered secure. If someone already has the software installed or downloads from legit source, it still makes them vulnerable to such attacks and attackers don't even need to use any malware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
