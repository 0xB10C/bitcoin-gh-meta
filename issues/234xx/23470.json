Non-technical\r\nor causal users don't care about whether the wallet is a descriptor wallet or not,\r\nthey just want to build (and or download) and use Bitcoin Core, and whatever it's\r\nwallet is, and accept a payment. Using \"descriptor wallet\" could also imply that\r\nthere is some other not legacy but also not a descriptor wallet alternative, which\r\nthere is not.\r\n\r\nNote that most builders now likely have to do nothing to get \"wallet support\" as\r\nthey will already have sqlite installed on their system, and configure no-longer\r\nfails if BDB isn't present and `--disable-wallet` hasn't been passed.",
