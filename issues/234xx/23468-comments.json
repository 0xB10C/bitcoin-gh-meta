The test framework python code is not meant to be utilities for interacting with `bitcoind`. It's sole purpose is to _be_ the functional test framework. While there is likely some overlapping use-case, I think the test framework code should be written and optimized to efficiently run the test framework only. If people did start using this as a more general-purpose library, I'd be worried that decisions to make it more generally useful might degrade its performance/usefulness in the test framework.\r\n\r\nSecondly, from personal experience, I did repurpose this code for a personal project I was doing and found myself fighting the code a lot and hacking it to make it more generally useful. I ended up using https://ofek.dev/bit/ , which I found to be much easier to use.",

I think this should also be our goal, but there seems to be disagreement (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21357#discussion_r600727982)\r\n\r\nAlso, as mentioned previously private keys in the tests are treated like a 123456 password. Not something that should be used outside of tests.\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to make it easier to write external Bitcoin Core tests, then that seems ok. Do you need `pip` for that or can you use the existing TestShell for it? https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/test/functional#prototyping-tests",
