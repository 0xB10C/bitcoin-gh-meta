The two drawbacks that I can think of.\r\n\r\n1) This one is listed in the BIP 341: If people directly use output keys in aggregation using proofs of knowledge.(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#cite_ref-22-0)\r\n2) In future protocol constructions, it might be desirable to prove that there is no script path given TxOut/ScriptPubKey/Address. This is not possible when using rawtr(), but is possible with tr() by revealing the internal key.\r\n\r\nSome more points for discussion:\r\n\r\n- Can we separate descriptors into two types in the spec itself? So, we can have `addr`, `raw`, `rawtr` into the infer-only category. The rest into another category that we can sign. In the infer only category, we can restrict the KEY expression to be a concrete public key without any BIP32 derivations or wildcards.\r\n\r\n- Correct me if I am wrong if the only use of inferred descriptors is that I can give it another party for watching a particular txout for me without revealing/knowing how the txout was constructed. So, assuming we disallow signing `rawtr()` (to encourage the usage of `tr` ) is there is any use of `rawtr()` over `raw()`?  ",
