   "body" : "(chopped off from #19031 to ease review)\r\n\r\nBefore this change `CNetAddr::ip` was a fixed-size array of 16 bytes,\r\nnot being able to store larger addresses (e.g. TORv3) and encoded\r\nsmaller ones as 16-byte IPv6 addresses.\r\n\r\nChange its type to `prevector`, so that it can hold larger addresses and\r\ndo not disguise non-IPv6 addresses as IPv6. So the IPv4 address\r\n`1.2.3.4` is now encoded as `01020304` instead of\r\n`00000000000000000000FFFF01020304`.\r\n\r\nRename `CNetAddr::ip` to `CNetAddr::m_addr` because it is not an \"IP\" or\r\n\"IP address\" (TOR addresses are not IP addresses).\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve backward compatibility with serialization (where\r\ne.g. `1.2.3.4` is serialized as `00000000000000000000FFFF01020304`)\r\nintroduce `CNetAddr` dedicated legacy serialize/unserialize methods.\r\n\r\nAdjust `CSubNet` accordingly. Still use `CSubNet::netmask[]` of fixed 16\r\nbytes, but use the first 4 for IPv4 (not the last 4). Do not accept\r\ninvalid netmasks that have 0-bits followed by 1-bits and only allow\r\nsubnetting for IPv4 and IPv6.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Carl Dong <contact@carldong.me>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review.
