While bitcoin.conf is mentioned in the man page, one would have to know what to look for or read a bit to get to the -conf section. By providing a skeleton file, a new user is more exposed to such an option. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\nAutomatically generate a skeleton bitcoin.conf with something like the one found at ```share/examples/bitcoin.conf``` when first starting bitcoind.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n",
