However saying that, recently there has been a trend of opening an issue with the log/failure before restarting, and I think we've seen more of those intermittent failures being fixed because of it. \r\n\r\nSemi related; I think that we should also be more aggressive about disabling hardware/jobs that (start to) consistently fail (due to issues outside our control. i.e the s390x build on Travis), otherwise the failures just generate spammy comments (here and on IRC), about having to restart builds, and in general seem to confuse non-regular contributors.",
