   "body" : "This tiny refactoring PR replaces all occurences of `sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0])` (or `sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x)`, respectively) with the macro `ARRAYLEN(x)`. While the pattern to determine the array of a length is a very common one and should be familiar for every C or C++ programmer, I think readability is still improved if it is hidden behind a macro. And since we have already `ARRAYLEN` in the codebase since the beginning (indeed Satoshi already had it in v0.1.0, see https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/src/util.h#L27), why not use it consistently?\r\n\r\nThe instances to replace were discovered via\r\n\r\n`$ grep -Ir \"sizeof.*/.*sizeof\" src/*`\r\n\r\nIf this gets a Concept ACK, one could probably discuss if the header `strencodings.h` is really the right location for this macro -- it doesn't have anything to do with strings at all. Maybe `util/macro.h` would be a more appropriate place.\r\n",
