It seems to be doing a lot and several functions are being renamed and removed.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, the second commit adds `DatabaseOptions` and `DatabaseStatus`. Then `CreateWalletDatabase` is renamed to `MakeWalletDatabase` and all of the various checks (file existence checks and database verify) are pushed into that function with `DatabaseOptions` informing the function what to actually do. And lastly `MakeWalletDatabase` becomes a separate distinct step that callers must do instead of letting `CWallet::Create` (renamed from `CreateWalletFromFile`) handle internally.\r\n\r\nFrom this, I think you could add a few more commits:\r\n* Introduction of `DatabaseOptions` and `DatabaseStatus` to consolidate the current options and status\r\n* Moving everything into `MakeWalletDatabase`\r\n* Separating `MakeWalletDatabase` from `CWallet::Create`",

It seems to be doing a lot and several functions are being renamed and removed.\r\n\r\nSure, I think I can split up like you're suggesting. The main change is introducing the `MakeBerkeleyDatabase` function. Then that function is called various places to get rid of path operations. So I think introducing MakeBerkeleyDatabase could be one commit, and then this can be followed by more commits calling it from RPC code, and then gui code, and then wallet tool code",
