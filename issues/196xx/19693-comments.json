I'm not sure what you mean by custom tailored, unless you're talking about our depends system? However in that case, it's \"tailored\" to serve a specific purpose.\r\n\r\n> Improve ecosystem by having option to build shared libraries\r\n> if i wanted to instead wrap around the C++ code using CFFI and call directly from Python/JS/Whatever I am unable to as where would I even begin to get started on compiling a library as opposed to the executable in a neat manner\r\n\r\nThe current build system can and does build shared libraries. i.e libconsensus. There is a large amount of discussion related to libconsensus in this repository. There are also some PRs that demonstrate integration with other languages, including Rust.\r\n\r\n> When developing, the sanitizers can be added\r\n> Proper sanitizing and bug catching\r\n\r\nOur build system currently has support for debugging/sanitizers/fuzzers etc and they are run as part of our CI. We also have some getting started type documentation for new contributors, i.e https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md. Is there a particular feature or support for a tool that you think is missing?\r\n\r\n> For instance, I found a buffer overflow in the tests within the ctaes library (inside crypto)\r\n\r\nGreat. Have you reported this upstream anywhere? See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/SECURITY.md.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you're likely to get more interest if you actually present a branch with all the changes required, as they are going to be substantial, involve multiple sub projects, third-party libraries, compilers, build tools etc. For what it's worth I'm still Concept NACK.",

You could use gitsubmodules or subtrees to help with this or just make the CMake scripts flexible enough to build different versions of bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe people who actually devote time and effort to maintaining the bitcoin build system already have many issues to deal with and lots of work to do (supporting reproducible builds, packaging and signing, minimizing dependencies) and don't have a huge amount of experience with CMake. It would be unrealistic to expect them to learn how to use and maintain a CMake build.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have a lot of experience with CMake and think it's much nicer than autotools. But I don't maintain the bitcoin build system, and I am glad if the people who do maintain the build system use the tools they're most knowledgeable about.",

Obviously that CMake file is going to be for developers only (like the current msvc) and won't support fancy build configs (like `./depends`).",

Bitcoin Core development is already a significant challenge to follow as an outsider with only fleeting contact with the project, not because it's not using the fanciest and greatest, but the amount of changes that happen between releases to tooling and interfaces.
