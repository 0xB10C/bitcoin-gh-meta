I'm not sure what you mean by custom tailored, unless you're talking about our depends system? However in that case, it's \"tailored\" to serve a specific purpose.\r\n\r\n> Improve ecosystem by having option to build shared libraries\r\n> if i wanted to instead wrap around the C++ code using CFFI and call directly from Python/JS/Whatever I am unable to as where would I even begin to get started on compiling a library as opposed to the executable in a neat manner\r\n\r\nThe current build system can and does build shared libraries. i.e libconsensus. There is a large amount of discussion related to libconsensus in this repository. There are also some PRs that demonstrate integration with other languages, including Rust.\r\n\r\n> When developing, the sanitizers can be added\r\n> Proper sanitizing and bug catching\r\n\r\nOur build system currently has support for debugging/sanitizers/fuzzers etc and they are run as part of our CI. We also have some getting started type documentation for new contributors, i.e https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/fuzzing.md. Is there a particular feature or support for a tool that you think is missing?\r\n\r\n> For instance, I found a buffer overflow in the tests within the ctaes library (inside crypto)\r\n\r\nGreat. Have you reported this upstream anywhere? See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/SECURITY.md.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you're likely to get more interest if you actually present a branch with all the changes required, as they are going to be substantial, involve multiple sub projects, third-party libraries, compilers, build tools etc. For what it's worth I'm still Concept NACK.",

Right no there is no crossplatform logic needed there, a cross-platform CMake build system would be much more complex)\r\n\r\nCan you explain to me why perhaps the trend for developers globally is to increase their usage of CMake, while the current build system used now is slowly losing share?\r\n\r\nCMake is more portable and easier to maintain is one of the many reasons its growing. I am not here to make this a flamewar of opinions, all I'm pointing out is the efficiencies gained to the project by adopting such a tool.\r\n\r\nI've seen here and across other issues/threads a common vein of the main argument being \"well we dont use an IDE\" as a good point to ***NOT*** improve the tooling for the project.\r\n\r\nMost C++/C devs use an IDE. Most of the younger devs are in fact using IDEs and are using CMake, if Bitcoin is expected to be here for the long run then perhaps some investment should be created for the yet-to-be developers of this project.",
