This is the first PR in the cs_main_split sequence where we start getting benefit by reducing cs_main scope in net processing. It also introduces the new structure and locking model, so it's the PR that requires the most conceptual/approach review in the sequence. If this gets merged, then it's a long procession of PRs to slowly move data into the new `Peer` object.",
