Then front-ends that query the estimator to show a fee rate to the user would have a more accurate idea about what will happen when they actually submit a transaction using `sendtoaddress`/`sendmany`.\r\n\r\nMy concern would be for Lightning nodes, which need to agree with their peers about the current state of the fee market. If the responses from Bitcoin Core's fee estimator are being influenced by mempool memory constraints, this could trigger mass unilateral channel closures, which is **VERY** expensive.",
