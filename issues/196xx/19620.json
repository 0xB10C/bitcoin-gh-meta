   "body" : "Our policy checks for non-standard inputs depend only on the non-witness\r\nportion of a transaction: we look up the scriptPubKey of the input being\r\nspent from our UTXO set (which is covered by the input txid), and the p2sh\r\nchecks only rely on the scriptSig portion of the input.\r\n\r\nConsequently it's safe to add txids of transactions that fail these checks to\r\nthe reject filter, as the witness is irrelevant to the failure. This is helpful\r\nfor any situation where we might request the transaction again via txid (either\r\nfrom txid-relay peers, or if we might fetch the transaction via txid due to\r\nparent-fetching of orphans).\r\n\r\nFurther, in preparation for future witness versions being deployed on the\r\nnetwork, ensure that WITNESS_UNKNOWN transactions are rejected in\r\nAreInputsStandard(), so that transactions spending v1 (or greater) witness\r\noutputs will fall into this category of having their txid added to the reject\r\nfilter.",
