      "body" : "Concept ACK\r\n\r\n> Over the past couple of years, I have noticed a pattern of behavior from some who participate in Bitcoin Core's development that is abusive and disruptive.\r\n\r\nCan you post publicly (perhaps in an accompanying issue to this pull request) examples of the behavior that you personally have noticed @achow101 that wouldn't meet this Code of Conduct? What I have noticed is people waving this accusation around and the accuser does the exact same thing. I have also noticed people use this general accusation as a rationale for not discussing anything in public or expressing their view in public. I don't see private DMs etc but I rarely see evidence backing up this general accusation in say public IRC channels.\r\n\r\nI'm supportive of project norms being clear and skimming the wording it looks reasonable to me though I will give a closer read at a later date.\r\n\r\nThanks for opening. I do want everyone to feel comfortable discussing and expressing their view in public. If this PR helps with that that's great.\r\n",
