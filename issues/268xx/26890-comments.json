What I have noticed is people waving this accusation around and the accuser does the exact same thing. I have also noticed people use this general accusation as a rationale for not discussing anything in public or expressing their view in public. I don't see private DMs etc but I rarely see evidence backing up this general accusation in say public IRC channels.\r\n\r\nI'm supportive of project norms being clear and skimming the wording it looks reasonable to me though I will give a closer read at a later date.\r\n\r\nThanks for opening. I do want everyone to feel comfortable discussing and expressing their view in public. If this PR helps with that that's great.\r\n",

There are separate projects such as secp256k1k, bips, hwi, etc. that may wish to adopt their own code of conduct. I don't want this to be something that the biggest project in the orgs forces upon all of the smaller ones who may not necessarily be following here. I do want there to be discussion and to have consensus among the contributors that this is something we want.\r\n\r\nI also don't think that separation would be meaningful in anyway. It's not as if this applies to anyone who uses bitcoin, just those who choose to participate in the development of this project. The scope section can be made clearer about this.\r\n\r\n> My second meta thought is that a formal code of conduct is ~useless when the actual moderation happens behind closed doors. From the outside people can't tell if a given action was justified.\r\n\r\nI agree, but it's also possible that there are sensitive things that may warrant privacy? My initial thoughts on how to handle this is that we essentially would have discussions of moderation actions occur in public through the Discussions feature, with other contributors being able to chime in. However as I have no experience in this area, I'm not certain that this would always be the right choice, depending on the type of violation. Although I think an important part of this is protecting the privacy of the violation reporter.\r\n\r\n> But it may still be better to have a set of publicly stated rules.\r\n\r\nI agree. We have made moderation actions in the past but without actually having guidelines on this, it's hard to say whether they were correct or appropriate.\r\n\r\n> Third meta thought: do the current maintainers really want the burden of a more formal moderation system? Especially knowing that saboteurs will game it anyway and cause even more grief? Does it create more legal attack surface? But that's for the maintainers to decide amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nI don't think this necessarily has to be on the current maintainers. As a group, it seems convenient since some of the maintainers already have the ability to block people from the org. However Github does have more granular roles such as Moderator that gives that ability but not the ability to add new commits to the repos. So we could definitely have people who are not maintainers involved in moderation actions. But I also think that it's necessary to have the people who can block be part of the moderation system to avoid having someone who can moderate but isn't part of the moderation process.\r\n\r\n> I find the current text rather annoyingly fluff, and it reveals the political leanings of the original author. It also contains wording that's inappropriate for a decentralised project, e.g. phrases like \"leaders\" and \"officially representing the community in public spaces\".\r\n\r\nYes, the wording definitely needs some tweaks. I've started looking around at other projects to pull in some wording from there. Detailed review is welcome\r\n\r\n> Perhaps a better approach is to start with an extremely small document that simply list things you shouldn't do and potential consequences: don't spam, don't go off topic, no ad homonyms, etc. Expand that list as new bad things happen, rather than trying to preempt every contingency.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with an approach like that is that if someone does something that we would want to add to the list, it becomes problematic as to how to deal with that kind of violation. Adding that new bad behavior could then be interpreted as targeting a particular individual in order to censor them, rather than a behavior that we want to avoid in the future which happens to be something an individual did now, especially if that ruling is applied retroactively. But I'm not sure, and I have proposed this as an IRC meeting topic for further discussion. Tbh, I don't disagree with the list provided already.\r\n\r\n> I'm worried about expanding the scope of moderation to behaviour outside the publicly visible channels. For example \"private harassment\", does that mean moderators can (must?) kick someone off the Github comments for something they did on Twitter? (and what if a moderator knows that friendly nym A is bad persona B IRL?)\r\n\r\nI think the original authors' intent on this wording is to deal with situations where a contributor goes privately messages someone to be abusive and harass them. I think the concern is that if you can only be banned for doing things publicly, then those people will just go to private messages to avoid consequences. This kind of behavior is something that has happened before. Recently, a (former) contributor posted on Twitter that another (former) contributor harassed them in private messages, with some pretty heinous stuff. If either were still active contributors, I think it would be reasonable to have banned the person who sent those messages. But I could also be convinced otherwise. This is also something that I think needs wider discussion.\r\n \r\n> I prefer to err on the side of caution when it comes to removing the ability of people to comment on pull requests. I'd rather not ship a zero-day because a mean person couldn't point it out. On the other hand such a person can probably get the information across by contacting another dev via-via. And of course Github can unilaterally ban folks too with the same effect (or delete their comments at the request of some spy agency, but that's another tangent).\r\n\r\nCertainly, but I don't think this makes that worse. Frankly, right now it's completely ad-hoc and up to the org owners. I think having a code of conduct actually adds accountability and would actually make it harder to unilaterally remove the ability of people to comment.",

Rule-based diplomacy can become a diffusion shield under which actions can be attributed to other than the personal responsibility of the people taking them.\r\n\r\nAfter wrangling the nutbar attackers in IRC for a decade, I would offer my gentle warning that the insidiousness of the characters you are going to be dealing with in the coming years can't really be understated. I would suggest that a CoC of this type will be more likely to be used against you than it will be the tool you hope will become a facilitator of diplomatic discourse.\r\n\r\nI unfortunately have no better suggestions for you, and I understand that you are attempting to solve a problem which clearly exists. Although.. probably a contributor release form might be a good idea to help defend against future legal liability?\r\n\r\nAnyway, much appreciate the effort you all are putting into the project. <3\r\n",

      "body" : "> some who participate in Bitcoin Core's development that is abusive and disruptive\r\n\r\nFor people who are being deliberately abusive and disruptive, a code of conduct can just provide another way of doing that; eg, by harassing people for unintentional violations, extending the scope of what's considered \"inappropriate\". It can also be used to make issues more divisive: find something that's a borderline violation of the policy, then either get the moderators to act, and criticise them for acting and being anti free speech, and encourage other people to also push the line to demonstrate how either arbitrary/inconsistent the moderation team is or how absolute/totalitarian they are or how they're just enabling group think etc; or have them not act, and criticise them for not following their own rules, or giving passes to their friends, etc. Then of course, it also adds another \"process\" topic for people to argue about, rather than actually doing work. It can also be stressful if you're constantly watching what you say, in order to avoid the hammer coming down on you for offending someone or violating some rule.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest doing things the other way around: figure out if anyone's willing to do moderation of disruptive behaviour in the repo (which will get you personally attacked as being bad for bitcoin and open source, even if for no reason other than that doing so is also disruptive and abusive), and, if anyone is willing, just have a really simple policy like \"we expect discussion in github/irc/whatever to be productive and cooperative; we'll give a brief nudge/warning where people appear to be being unproductive/uncooperative by accident, but will remove posts/access when it becomes repeated or appears deliberate\".\r\n\r\n(Note that sometimes you'll find yourself in a position where you ought to be nudging/warning people you respect, for saying something unconstructive in the heat of the moment; and if they were being unconstructive because they were already angry about the topic, they might not react well to such a warning/nudge either. It can be a pretty un-fun job)\r\n\r\n(Also, whether something is \"productive\" or \"cooperative\" is a judgement call, but so is whether something should be merged or not -- if you don't like the judgement calls being made in the repo, the productive solution is to move somewhere else, either forking the code or making your own discussion space and demonstrate the benefits of your preferred approach)",
