      "body" : "Concept ACK\r\n\r\n> Over the past couple of years, I have noticed a pattern of behavior from some who participate in Bitcoin Core's development that is abusive and disruptive.\r\n\r\nCan you post publicly (perhaps in an accompanying issue to this pull request) examples of the behavior that you personally have noticed @achow101 that wouldn't meet this Code of Conduct? What I have noticed is people waving this accusation around and the accuser does the exact same thing. I have also noticed people use this general accusation as a rationale for not discussing anything in public or expressing their view in public. I don't see private DMs etc but I rarely see evidence backing up this general accusation in say public IRC channels.\r\n\r\nI'm supportive of project norms being clear and skimming the wording it looks reasonable to me though I will give a closer read at a later date.\r\n\r\nThanks for opening. I do want everyone to feel comfortable discussing and expressing their view in public. If this PR helps with that that's great.\r\n",

      "body" : "My first meta-thought is to not put this in the bitcoin codebase. It could live somewhere in the bitcoin-core Github organisation. Individual repositories can point to it in their Github description. And you can point to it from IRC.\r\n\r\nThat way we keep a clean separation between _bitcoin the code_ and _those who happen to have control over the main Github and IRC channels and need to deal with moderation somehow_.\r\n\r\nMy second meta thought is that a formal code of conduct is ~useless when the actual moderation happens behind closed doors. From the outside people can't tell if a given action was justified. But it may still be better to have a set of publicly stated rules.\r\n\r\nThird meta thought: do the current maintainers really want the burden of a more formal moderation system? Especially knowing that saboteurs will game it anyway and cause even more grief? Does it create more legal attack surface? But that's for the maintainers to decide amongst themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find the current text rather annoyingly fluff, and it reveals the political leanings of the original author. It also contains wording that's inappropriate for a decentralised project, e.g. phrases like \"leaders\" and \"officially representing the community in public spaces\".\r\n\r\nPerhaps a better approach is to start with an extremely small document that simply list things you shouldn't do and potential consequences: don't spam, don't go off topic, no ad homonyms, etc. Expand that list as new bad things happen, rather than trying to preempt every contingency.\r\n\r\nI'm worried about expanding the scope of moderation to behaviour outside the publicly visible channels. For example \"private harassment\", does that mean moderators can (must?) kick someone off the Github comments for something they did on Twitter? (and what if a moderator knows that friendly nym A is bad persona B IRL?)\r\n\r\nI prefer to err on the side of caution when it comes to removing the ability of people to comment on pull requests. I'd rather not ship a zero-day because a mean person couldn't point it out. On the other hand such a person can probably get the information across by contacting another dev via-via. And of course Github can unilaterally ban folks too with the same effect (or delete their comments at the request of some spy agency, but that's another tangent).",
