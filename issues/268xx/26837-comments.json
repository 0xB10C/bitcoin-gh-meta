If run by N threads, then the size can be at most N, if all of the threads race into it.\r\n\r\nI think that is ok with the current pattern of add 1, take 1. Just a note to the future - if the code is changed to add more entries to the list and it takes.",

The key is you've gone from 290 tunnels at startup down to 22, which is a massive massive improvement.\r\n\r\nA couple notes:\r\n\r\n- You should monitor/test the reliability of connections over transient tunnels with *.quantity=1. If it doesn't meet your requirements, retest with *.quantity=2 to see if that improves things enough to be worth the additional resource usage.\r\n- You should monitor/test the performance of non-transient tunnels with *.quantity=3. If it doesn't meet your requirements, try 4 or 5 to see if that improves things enough to be worth the additional resource usage.\r\n- Agreed you want to avoid a pool with lots of unused sessions for a long time, either by design or some check. Also maybe close all idle sessions once you get to 10 good ones? Up to you, you're on the right track here.\r\n- Try to get an ack from i2pd's @orignal",
