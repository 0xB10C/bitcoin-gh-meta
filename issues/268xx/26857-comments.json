      "body" : "Great to see this, I hope this functionality comes into Bitcoin one way or another, and this seems like a decent attempt. Your listing of the features makes sense, and I currently don't think a more optimal way to achieve them.\r\n\r\nBy no means blockers, but rather some thoughts I wanted to share on the design:\r\n1. I'm personally not sure batching withdrawals is that compelling... It's a nice-to-have, but I'd think about the benefits dropping this feature would provide.\r\n2. Or, from a different angle, the issue of malicious de-batching should not stop this idea from moving forward, as I'm not convinced this use case would be that widespread. I want to think more about use cases (solo user cold wallet, exchange cold wallet, fund cold wallet) and what their setups would look like.",
