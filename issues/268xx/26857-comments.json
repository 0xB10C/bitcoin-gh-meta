Your listing of the features makes sense, and I currently don't think a more optimal way to achieve them.\r\n\r\nBy no means blockers, but rather some thoughts I wanted to share on the design:\r\n1. I'm personally not sure batching withdrawals is that compelling... It's a nice-to-have, but I'd think about the benefits dropping this feature would provide.\r\n2. Or, from a different angle, the issue of malicious de-batching should not stop this idea from moving forward, as I'm not convinced this use case would be that widespread. I want to think more about use cases (solo user cold wallet, exchange cold wallet, fund cold wallet) and what their setups would look like.",

The impossibility to batch Unvaults in Revault is a major drawback: it significantly increases the cost of any realistic operation (you need one whole additional transaction per input, and each have likely more than one output). It also potentially increases the cost on the network (you'd likely want some sort of anchor output on each Unvault tx, that you might not spend, so that's `2*n` outputs created with `n` the number of coins spent): we definitely don't want to prevent batching. The ability to batch the recovery transactions (what we called Emergency tx in Revault) is also very compelling but i think your comment was only about batched withdrawals.",
