      "body" : "ACK c5c6116\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour is that a node run with `-maxconnections=0` **will** query the DNS seeds and fetch addresses, but not make any connections out to them. Testing with a mainnet node saw it fetch ~300 addresses but not make any connections after that.\r\n\r\nWith this patch the node no longer makes connections to the DNS seeds to fetch addresses. (You may want to amend the wording for the [`-dnsseed` option](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/10a5f1903725dba8dd265d3150ce1a53ffa3e904/src/init.cpp#L464) to explain that this will not apply in this new situation also?)\r\n\r\nI think that the new behaviour makes sense as a user specifying an option `-maxconnections=0` would not expect their software to begin by, making connections... especially a privacy-focussed software like Bitcoin Core. The only use-case lost would be users who wanted to fetch addresses from DNS seeds using Bitcoin Core, but they can continue to do this (more) easily with `dig` or `nslookup`.",
