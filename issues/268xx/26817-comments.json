      "body" : "The interesting question is one is allowed to do this.\r\n\r\nLet's ask the license first. The license in COPYING is (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n> The MIT License (MIT)\r\n> \r\n> Copyright (c) 2009-2023 The Bitcoin Core developers\r\n> Copyright (c) 2009-2023 Bitcoin Developers\r\n>\r\n>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n>\r\n> **The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.**\r\n> (...)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo if you read that literally, then at least the license only cares about the \"above\" copyright notice (in COPYING) and not these in the source files... Good. But all the files say they're covered by the license, too. Hm.\r\n\r\nOkay, now what about the law?\r\n\r\nLet's look at some examples:\r\n\r\nUS:\r\n>  17 U.S. Code Â§ 506 - Criminal offenses\r\n >(d) Fraudulent Removal of Copyright Notice.â \r\n> Any person who, with fraudulent intent, removes or alters any notice of copyright appearing on a copy of a copyrighted work shall be fined not more than $2,500.  \r\n> (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/506)\r\n\r\nI guess removing the date is altering the noting. And okay, I suspect the intent here is not fraudulent but you want to risk it? \r\n\r\nGermany:\r\n > UrhG, Section 39 (translated)\r\n> Alterations of work\r\n> (1) The holder of a right of use is not permitted to alter the work, its title or designation of authorship (section 10 (1)), unless otherwise agreed.\r\n> (2) Alterations to the work and its title to which the author cannot refuse consent based on the principles of good faith are permitted.\r\n\r\nNote that the exception in (2) does *not* include the designation of authorship. So there's a good chance that removing the date would violate (1).\r\n\r\nBad enough but what about a few hundred other jurisdictions? And the law of which jurisdiction does apply here? That was a difficult question even before the Internet and it's much more difficult now, and even more difficult with projects like these which can be download from almost every jurisdiction in the world (probably from servers in different jurisdictions) and has contributors from different jurisdictions, for some of which we don't even know the jurisdiction, e.g., the original author of the software. \r\n\r\nInternational copyright law is pretty much not helpful. That's how it is and I think we need to accept this.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not a lawyer, I just happen to be interested in legal stuff a little bit. So here's what you should do: Talk to a lawyer, e.g,, try to contact a Bitcoin legal defense fund and see what they think.  In libsecp256k1, we also would like to simplify the license handling. (It's actually on my list to contact someone for libsecp256k1.)  Maybe an expert lawyer has some clever suggestion. For example, I could imagine to simply introduce a rule that says to never update copyright notices. (That certainly won't alter them!) That's even simpler than this PR. \r\n\r\nBut again, an expert response will certainly be more helpful than mine. ",
