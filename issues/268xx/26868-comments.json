It isn't going to be a particularly interesting or informative doc.\r\n\r\nOn the Vasil issue I think we're in agreement(?) @1440000bytes but I don't know how for example this document would resolve the Vasil issue in any way. Two maintainers are refusing to comment (or choosing to ignore the PR). Hence this document is pretty useless in solving the Vasil issue. If someone wants to put their name forward to be a maintainer they can in the IRC meeting. If they are a long term contributor they will know about the IRC meeting already and will be able to assess whether putting their name forward is appropriate or not. They won't need to refer to a document like this.\r\n",

What real world problems have you identified that this document provides a solution for?\r\n\r\nThis document contains list of present maintainers, their role and selection process. Goal is to document things (related to maintainers for bitcoin core) that everyone agrees upon and improve with time.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a new practice and you might find lot of open source projects with such file if you search `maintainers.md github` in a search engine. There is a [blog post](https://github.com/readme/guides/maintainer-monolith) about trying to solve related issues and start with `maintainers.md`.\r\n\r\nI'll quote one line from it:\r\n\r\n\"**MAINTAINERS.md** _is the first step towards finding human solutions to human problems_\"\r\n\r\n> If I'm forced I'll open an alternative PR with some wording on what maintainers do to nip this in the bud but it basically boils down to maintainers merge pull requests, a long term contributor can put their name forward to be a maintainer in a IRC meeting and open a pull request like Gloria, Vasil have done. It isn't going to be a particularly interesting or informative doc.\r\n\r\nYou are free to open another pull request. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25839 was closed on Oct 3, 2022 and labelled 'up for grabs' since then. I picked it up based on a suggestion by @MarcoFalke in a [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26751#issuecomment-1373656594).\r\n\r\n> On the Vasil issue I think we're in agreement(?) @1440000bytes but I don't know how for example this document would resolve the Vasil issue in any way. Two maintainers are refusing to comment (or choosing to ignore the PR). Hence this document is pretty useless in solving the Vasil issue. If someone wants to put their name forward to be a maintainer they can in the IRC meeting. If they are a long term contributor they will know about the IRC meeting already and will be able to assess whether putting their name forward is appropriate or not. They won't need to refer to a document like this.\r\n\r\nI have added both pull requests as [topic for next weekly bitcoin core IRC meeting](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2023-01-11#883146;). This document is public information which helps every new contributor to understand the process. I don't see any downsides of being transparent and document basic things.",
