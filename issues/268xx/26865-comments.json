We tried them, but they didn't really produce useful output on the code.\r\n\r\nI haven't played with them long enough to really answer but one useful feature of SonarCloud is that you can get a PR diff analysis.\r\n \r\n---\r\n\r\n> Looks very noisy, with 1000's of false positives etc. Maybe wait until it finds something actionable?\r\n\r\nYeah, I don't recommend looking at the master branch, there is a lot of data. But I think it still outputs good results for PRs as it only shows the diff between the master analysis and the PR analysis.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't want to make the CI fail if SonarCloud reports bad code quality as there is a high chance that there will be false positives, but only provide a code quality report so that it can quickly be looked at to see how the code can be improved.\r\nAny rule that gives too many false positives can be disabled also.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> What do you mean by properly? Couldn't you just run this yourself and open an issue if anything interesting is reported? Same as we do for OSS-Fuzz / other tools.\r\n\r\nBy properly I mean integrating it in the Bitcoin Core CI because to upload the report to sonarcloud it needs a (free) token generated by a repo admin.\r\nYes, I could run it myself but on a limited amount of PRs. I also think it's more practical to generate the report from the CI and provide it after every push event and display it to everyone.",
