Though, I'm not sure if that must be transported on the UI (ideally it could, but more or less orthogonal to this issue).\r\nThe UI does only count/display the amount of confirmation not the amount of security (the non-linear part), the later is currently up to the users definition (which indeed is not ideal).\r\n\r\nThe problem with the UI is that the 10min, 20min, 40min, 50min icon would look worse on non HiDPI screens.\r\n\r\nPRs welcome.",
