If you feel up to it, I think we'd do better by just hardcoding the number of runs in each benchmark - it is often very easy to see very significant differences in the average runtime based on number of runs (even for things which take 1+ms per run!). Unless you have some better intuition than I about why this is the case, that is.",

There I've used the geometric mean I think is a much better statistic than average here, and its better when you have outliers. I also think having the mean and confidence interval is much more reasonable than just min, max,avg values. Would you be interested in updates like this?",
