If you feel up to it, I think we'd do better by just hardcoding the number of runs in each benchmark - it is often very easy to see very significant differences in the average runtime based on number of runs (even for things which take 1+ms per run!). Unless you have some better intuition than I about why this is the case, that is.",

If you feel up to it, I think we'd do better by just hardcoding the number of runs in each benchmark \r\n\r\nThe idea of doing it this way is that the benchmarks can be run in roughly the same time on slower hardware, whereas on faster hardware they are more precise. The secp256k1 benchmarks have the problem that they take basically forever on lower-end CPUs. I agree it's probably broken though, and the range of CPUs that bitcoind can realistically run on is much smaller than secp256k1's.\r\n(if this is an issue, maybe a fixed scaling factor could be passed on the command line for this purpose, that scales all the benchmark iterations equally and is at least deterministic?)",
