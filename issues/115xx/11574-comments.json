If I need to know `-help-debug` to show these, I may as well grep through the source code tree.\r\n\r\nIs there a plan to add more such debug-level parameters? If so, maybe some \"advanced\" options shouldn't be not shown by default, but it's only two in RPC section (maybe a few more in other sections). ",
