Since the review of #10866 is taking some time my thinking was that this trivial fix could perhaps get in faster than #10866 which has some additional stuff (Travis CI changes + change of `sync.h` primitives to `std` from `boost`).\r\n\r\nHaving #10866 reviewed and merged would be even better and would render this PR obsolete :-)",
