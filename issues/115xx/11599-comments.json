I didn't rename CCriticalSection because it's used everywhere and changing it would make the diff 3 times as big (22 lines -> 73 lines). Also I think we will probably lean toward using non-recursive rather than recursive locks in new code, so CCriticalSection name should not matter as much going forward. I kept the C in CCriticalLock to be consistent with CCriticalSection. CCriticalLock is only used internally in sync.h so again it shouldn't have an impact on new code, and I didn't see a reason to break consistency within sync.h.",
