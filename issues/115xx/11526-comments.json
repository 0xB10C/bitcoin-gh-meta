In my troubleshooting I've discovered Visual Studio will add tab characters into a solution (.sln) file whenever it's opened. It possibly does the same for it's other .vcproj, .vcxproj.user and .vcxproj.filters files as well although it didn't during my quick testing.\r\n\r\nI could add a new rule to contrib/devtools/lint-whitespace.sh for these file types but I think I'll leave it until a decision on this PR is made.",

It's bound to break from time to time with build updates (most of us are not able to use this).\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nIf the VS build config gets added I will commit to maintaining it for a minimum of 3 years (end of 2020) excepting death, disability etc. As character assessment I've been an open source contributor since the early noughties: sourceforge, codeplex, bitbucket, github etc; no project highlights that will impress you guys but the relevant point is that I'm capable of hanging around.\r\n\r\nI'd also expect the VS config to become popular in a short space of time which would reduce the maintenance burden.
