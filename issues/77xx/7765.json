Took a backup of my wallet file, cleaned bitcoin folders and started all over again...  At some point during synchronisation bitcoin-core looked like working but synchro was stalled.  Had to reboot my mac for a critical update.  Started bitcoin-core app after reboot, synchronisation worked well and finished, received latest transactions in my wallet.  This was Saturday.\r\n\r\nToday, crash again doing nothing and won't reload.  It start but crash again on block verification...\r\n\r\nFirst time I think, ok something corrupted the chainstate files somehow but this time I do think that it's caused by the app.\r\n\r\nSo here's the crash report and debug log\r\n[bitcoin-core_crash-report.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/194005/bitcoin-core_crash-report.txt)\r\n[debug.log.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/194011/debug.log.txt)\r\n",
