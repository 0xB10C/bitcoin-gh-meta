      "body" : "In #7723 I made the build system invoked scripts compatible with both Python2 and Python3.\r\n\r\nFor the build system I think it's good to have both Python2 and Python3 compatibility (annoying to have specific dependencies there). This is not necessary for the other python scripts, such as the RPC tests. For practical reasons it's ok to have an explicit Python 2.7 dependency for those - though we'll have to document that in the invocation instructions.\r\n\r\nPorting the non-build-system Python scripts in one go to Python3, without intermediate Python 2 and 3 compatibility phase is a better use of our time. We'll have to decide when, though. Like the c++11 change, it's probably something some people feel very strongly about.\r\n",

That's what ```python-version``` returns, and Armory runs & compiles just fine. (Armory is still Py2-only.) I did this without apt-getting python2.7. Am I missing something? I see that Beta 2 should be out tomorrow. Maybe there will be a switch at that time? Doesn't seem wise to switch once in beta mode, though.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

      "body" : "@laanwj - Thanks for clarifying. Just to clarify things on my end, I installed the desktop ISO and let VMware auto-install everything. I'm guessing something in the desktop version requires Python 2, as I didn't manually install it.\r\n\r\nIn any event, I'm glad to hear that work is progressing on upgrading the tests to Python 3. Having compatibility for both is good but, as mentioned in the meeting yesterday, maintaining compatibility is extra work. As long as there's no supported environment that's Py2-only, I say take the path of least resistance. Just keep in mind that the 2-to-3 script out there (or at least the one we used to create a Py3 Armory prototype) is a bit buggy. Hopefully manual intervention will be kept to a minimum.",
