This is a required, but up to now missing part of deprecating the account system.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to rule out any other work that is being done such as multi-wallet support. I think this is pretty much orthogonal. As for alternative wallets, they've been proposed since at least 2012 - but none have materialized yet. And none of this change rules them out.\r\n",

Need to think about this a bit.\r\n\r\nI thought of the following: you could use two labels, one for the 'active' address, one for the 'normal'. Say `mining_active` and `mining`.\r\n\r\nWhen the miner needs an address it will:\r\n- *addr* = `getaddressesbylabel mining_active` (if no address returned, go to \"if so\" directly below and skip the first)\r\n- `getreceivedbyaddress` - check with wallet that *addr* has been used before (or maybe add a more convenient RPC call for checking a single address)\r\n- If so:\r\n  -  `setlabel <addr> mining`  - move current address to normal label\r\n  - *addr* = `getnewaddress mining_active` - generate new address in `mining_active` label\r\n  - Use *addr* for mining to\r\n- If not:\r\n  - Use *addr* for mining to\r\n\r\nThis is a little bit more involved at the user side, but it avoids special administration (needing to keep around `CAccount` structure per label) at the server side.",
