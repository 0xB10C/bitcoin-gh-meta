Also realize that a client may need this value to process further, not to show to the user: e.g. bitwise-AND operations should be done on a number, not a string, so this change may mean doing an *extra* conversion from hex to int on the client side.\r\n\r\nNo strong opposition to adding it as extra field, though I'd still say adding a field to avoid an extra hex conversion on the client side is too much hand-holding. This shouldn't set a precedent to add hex, octal, binary for every field.\r\n",
