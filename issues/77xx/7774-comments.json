Also realize that a client may need this value to process further, not to show to the user: e.g. bitwise-AND operations should be done on a number, not a string, so this change may mean doing an *extra* conversion from hex to int on the client side.\r\n\r\nNo strong opposition to adding it as extra field, though I'd still say adding a field to avoid an extra hex conversion on the client side is too much hand-holding. This shouldn't set a precedent to add hex, octal, binary for every field.\r\n",

      "body" : "I went ahead and added the extra data to `bip9_softforks` in `getblockchaininfo`.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to decide was if/when to show the bit information.\r\nSince the relevant bit information for a given block version changes over time, it would be confusing to always show the bit info for every soft fork that was ever defined with this mechanism.\r\nIt's actually not quite as straightforward as I guessed it would be.\r\nFor example, BIP9 gives the guidance:\r\n\r\n\"Miners should continue setting the bit in LOCKED_IN phase so uptake is visible, though this has no effect on consensus rules.\"\r\n\r\n\"There could be two non-overlapping deployments on the same bit, where the first one transitions to LOCKED_IN while the other one simultaneously transitions to STARTED, which would mean both would demand setting the bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once the consensus change succeeds or times out, there is a \"fallow\" pause after which the bit can be reused for later changes.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the plan is to have a fallow period, due to consensus allowing a locked in bit to be immediately reused, it might not really be safe for a miner to continue setting the bit.\r\nEDIT: this is also feedback to @sipa about `ComputeBlockVersion` continuing to set the version bit during LOCKED_IN, assuming my understanding of BIP9 is correct.\r\nThus, it might not make sense to show the info for a locked in soft fork even though during normal operations, the fallow period is observed and it would make sense to give a user the info.\r\n\r\nSo, I took the conservative approach and decided to only show the bit info during an active voting period, that is when the soft fork is in state STARTED.\r\nThis gives an indication to users that if the hex block version is other than 20000000 and no info is shown in `bip9_softforks`, then either everything is locked in, or there is fork voting going on for something the node software being used does not know about.\r\n\r\nI left the condition as a separate block in-case we decide to change it to `THRESHOLD_STARTED == thresholdState || THRESHOLD_LOCKED_IN == thresholdState`. I figured I'd throw this out there and see what other people thought.",
