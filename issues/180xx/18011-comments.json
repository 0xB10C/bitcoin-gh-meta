Is this no longer required to reduce variance?\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly -- and separately -- can you comment on how this might impact the need for something like #17375? Can we add better support for benchmarks where we want to run with different scaling params and output each trial to get a sense of the complexity? ",

I found it actually to be more reliable with shorter runs, because there is less chance for random fluctuations to interfer. It is necessary though to disable frequency scaling etc (but this should be done with the old framework too anyways).
