   "body" : "This implements an index of coin statistics with the goal of making the response time of the `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC call dramatically faster. Currently, this RPC is scanning the full UTXO set every time it is called which makes it hard to use for users that want to continually check the coin supply or compare UTXO set hashes between different nodes. It is especially challenging in periods of multiple quickly mined blocks, even relatively fast machines.\r\n\r\nImplementation overview:\r\n- The current serialization of the UTXO set for the purpose of hashing is changed based on sipa's concept in proposed on the [mailing list in 2017](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014337.html) and #10434\r\n- The hashing algorithm in for the UTXO set is changed to Muhash, which was also implemented by sipa\r\n- CoinStatsIndex is added which keeps an index of all values that would require `gettxoutsetinfo` to scan the UTXO set\r\n- CoinStatsIndex can be activated through the flag `-coinstatsindex`\r\n\r\nTodos/Open questions:\r\n- The transactions count is currently not implemented as it seems not knowable ex-post without running a full IBD to build up the index. I am looking for a solution to this. Ideas are:\r\n  - Require `txindex` and the transactions count from it\r\n  - Remove transactions count or mark it as unreliable in a different way if coinstatsindex is enabled\r\n- The transactions count question is also interesting because it seems to be the only obstacle to providing access to historical coin statistics, which may be a nice follow-up feature if transaction counts can be ignored somehow\r\n- More benchmarking to evaluate potential switch from Muhash to [ECMH](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/477) as the hashing algorithm\r\n- IBD benchmarking with the index enabled\r\n- Tests could be improved\r\n\r\nThis is an extension to my [rolling UTXO set hash proposal](https://gist.github.com/fjahr/fa4892874b090d3a4f4fccc5bafa0210) from last year.\r\n\r\nEdit: 3c5c1ca should probably be squashed into the prior commits but I wanted to leave sipa's commits unchanged for the start.",
