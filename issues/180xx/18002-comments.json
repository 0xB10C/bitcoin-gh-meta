      "body" : "I'm generally a big fan of cleaning up this consensus logic such that the code is  \"tree-like\" and terminates at leaf branches, rather than having interleaved \"dag-like\" branches that merge into a common exit point. One of the key advantages of code structured in this way is it's much easier to see, at a glance, exactly how many \"versions\" (i.e., combinations of flags) we support. Otherwise, with N things that could either be on or off you get something like 2**N potential execution traces which makes it really hard to write tests for all flows (coverage is not enough).\r\n\r\nIt's a code style that I think we should strive to use when possible, and it makes me a bit extreme in that I go as far as to think we should re-write some other consensus logic (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15969) to be more in line with this style.\r\n\r\nI say the above here not to advocate for more expansive changes at this time, but more so that other reviewers can appropriately discount my ACKs here if you disagree with this viewpoint.\r\n\r\nThat this makes Taproot simpler to review and implement is a plus, but I think these changes stand on their own.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK + lite CR-ack, untested.",
