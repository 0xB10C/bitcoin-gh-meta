I think the only time that we can get a never-existing coin from the cache is with `AccessCoin()`. We could change that to return a const pointer instead of a const reference and return `nullptr` if the coin doesn't exist. That's what `AccessCoins()` did before we changed to per-txout coinsdb.\r\n\r\nPerhaps @sipa had a reason for introducing the `coinEmpty` that I don't understand though?",
