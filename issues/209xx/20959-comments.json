It looks like every `0x0a` (newline character) is accompanied by a `0x0d` (carriage return character). So the problem most likely is due to the text mode and Windows using CRLF instead of just LF.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw this problem, I thought it was memory corruption. But I didn't recognize that `0x0d` was CR, and that it was happening everything there was an `0x0a`.",
