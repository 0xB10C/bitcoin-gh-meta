The file saved via that approach gives a different error when I try to load it: \"extra data after PSBT\"\r\n\r\nThis is on Windows so I suspect this is related to text vs. binary encoding messing with CRLF\r\nIn particular these ofstreams:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/cb2c578451770a29395f79f7077c362e1f54dfdd/src/qt/sendcoinsdialog.cpp#L437\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c7ad94428ab6f54661d7a5441e1fdd0ebf034903/src/qt/psbtoperationsdialog.cpp#L148\r\n\r\nshould be created in binary mode (the default is text mode)",
