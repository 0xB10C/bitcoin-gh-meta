While the serialized block header would not be bigger than the stack size, header serialization would need to happen even when no USDTs are attached. This has an performance impact and should not be done.  \r\n\r\n@jb55 used an earlier version of `validation:connect_block` to measure IBD performance.  \r\n\r\nDepending on placement in `ConnectBlock()`, this could either trace to-be-connected blocks or connected blocks (no error while connecting). In either way, the documentation should make it clear for which blocks the data is passed. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7d8a10a6f4d61df1f4afb138e379149565afa02d/src/validation.cpp#L1946",
