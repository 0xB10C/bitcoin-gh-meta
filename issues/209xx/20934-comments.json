      "body" : "Took some time to look at the problem, it seems to be quite tricky to solve in a solid way. I tried the [suggested method of \"syncing up\" via repeatedly generating a block and waiting for the expected message](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20538#issuecomment-738791868) (until it doesn't timeout anymore), but generating a block seems to interfere with some of the sub-tests. It also already generates notification messages for our subs that are received later (even if we are not connected yet). Maybe something like this would work:\r\n- restart node with additional `pubhashtx` test publisher (on a port not used by any of the test subs)\r\n- repeatedly generate block and wait for expected messages from test publisher, until it doesn't time out anymore\r\n- invalidate generated blocks\r\n- clear mempool (needed?)\r\n- read from our subscriber sockets until there is no data (a \"reverse flush\" so to say)\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm thinking too complicated though.\r\nWhatever the solution will be, at least having a common test setup method should serve as a better basis for solving this issue: #20953",
