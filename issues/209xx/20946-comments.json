Very happy to the number of active contributors to `src/test/fuzz/` grow :)\r\n\r\n> Question for fuzzing people: was it intentional that `src/test/fuzz/net.cpp` would directly instantiate the `BasicTestingSetup` and thus omit the `\"-nodebuglogfile\"` flag?\r\n\r\nI don't think that was intentional on my part. We want `-nodebuglogfile` :)",
