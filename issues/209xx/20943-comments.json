Change the return type of SubmitMemoryPoolAndReturn (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/wallet.h#L506) to an enum class TEMPORARY_FAILURE / PERMENANT_FAILURE / SUBMITTED. \r\n2. In the case of PERMENANT_FAILURE, we can delete the transaction from the wallet immediately (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L3182)\r\n\r\nIf that's sounds right, I'd submit a patch for this in the coming days",
