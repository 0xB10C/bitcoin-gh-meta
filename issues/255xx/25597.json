With no possibility to re-acquire the mutex in the same thread, there is no reason for it to be a RecursiveMutex, so we can change it to an ordinary Mutex instead.\r\n\r\n(An alternative would be to just get rid of the mutex, as it currently doesn't serve any purpose, as long as we only have one message handling thread.)",
