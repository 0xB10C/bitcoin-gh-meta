Static musl builds would be very cool but tricky to audit for parity and thus pretty unlikely to ever become official/supported imo. This is a MUCH more palatable change.",

This should speed up compiling GCC, and slightly reduces the size of the pthread patch. I'm not currently disabling these features via the available [configure flags](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html), because they get passed through to GMP, which cannot handle them.\r\n\r\nI've also updated `-flto` usage to be `-flto=auto`, as that seems to now be the preferred invocation, and it mitigates GCC warning output. i.e:\r\n```bash\r\nlto-wrapper: warning: using serial compilation of 84 LTRANS jobs\r\nlto-wrapper: note: see the '-flto' option documentation for more information\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also split the ELF PIE check into it's own func, so we can special-case x86_64, and re-added the list of allowed ELF libs, but special-cased x86_64 to only pass if the list is empty.
