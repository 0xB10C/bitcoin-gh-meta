      "body" : "NACK \r\n\r\nI had no strong opinion until yesterday and still think she is a good coder and reviewer. However, this pull request gives commit access which I am not sure about:\r\n\r\nReasons:\r\n\r\n1. If this pull request is merged, there will be 7 maintainers and 3 funded by Brink. This was even mentioned by @0xB10C as nit in [meeting](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-06-30#827758;). Bitcoin has only 1 implementation used by majority of nodes. It would be better if maintainers were from different parts of world and funded by different organizations. Being anon could also be helpful. \r\n\r\n2. Process of adding another maintainer could be improved. One of the suggestion from @ariard was to know if we have other candidates interested for being a maintainer. Others were mainly about scope of a maintainer.\r\n\r\n3. Self merging mempool related pull requests would be different from build, wallet etc. and if this role is just about running a script then it could be done by any of the present maintainers when there are enough ACKs and no technical NACK. There are a [few other contributors](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-07-01#828347;) that are not sure about self merge.\r\n\r\n4. Speculations about full-rbf being default in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25353 by PR author did not look like the right approach. Lot of important pull requests are open that could affect security of different bitcoin projects (positively or negatively) related to mempool. I would prefer status-quo with more reviewers or developers with more experience in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n5. I do not understand why @theuni  was trying to stop some people from sharing their thoughts in meeting.\r\n\r\n6. @laanwj also found questions, suggestions etc. from Jeremy Rubin annoying and mentioned that an opinion about PR author being maintainer was [changed](https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2022-06-30#828026;) recently.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI know this NACK would not be considered being a new contributor and this [comment](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/99674/how-do-devs-decide-who-should-have-commit-access-what-is-the-process/99676#comment112930_99676) by @achow101 however still want to document my thoughts as review for this PR. Also if governments/banks/3 letter agencies would ever try this, I am sure they won't use new contributors or random accounts based on my experience.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "@1440000bytes full time developers are more likely to get to a skill level where they can be a maintainer. Sponsored developers are more likely able to work full time. Conversely, maintainers are more likely to get sponsorship due to their reputation. Combine that with Pareto's law, and you're just going to have a situation where one organisation sponsors a relatively large chunk of maintainers. This happened with Blockstream, then with Chaincode, now with Brink.\r\n\r\nIf we had a huge surplus of candidate maintainers, then perhaps this sort of stuff could factored in. But we nearly ran out. The maintainers that have been around the longest have all been subjected to legal attacks, which could have forced them to become salary slaves at Google to pay off infinite bills. The lead maintainer has said multiple times he [doesn't want to do this forever](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html).\r\n\r\nI'm very happy to see several fresh maintainers step up to this task. It mainly involves ungrateful boring work and personal risk.\r\n\r\nIf you're worried about a pattern of malicious merges by maintainers, then rather than blocking new maintainers, a more productive course of action might be to keep a very close eye on what gets merged. It all happens in the open. There's a signed public record.",

      "body" : "-0, which defaults to NACK from me\r\n\r\n@glozow is an excellent coder and thinker, and I am hugely supportive of her work, but a few things make me hesitate here. My main concern is that @glozow is an impartial participant in the development of mempool design, and she has a number of outstanding proposals and PRs in that area. Presumably she will continue to put forward proposed designs that need to be evaluated by others. I think her role as a maintainer might muddy the waters, and cause others to be more likely to defer to her proposals on the basis of perceived hierarchy.\r\n\r\nYou can make the argument that other maintainers were in a similar position when inbound, e.g. @achow101 and @hebasto, but things like wallet and GUI and relatively localized to Core, don't have as wide a design space as mempool, and do not crosscut through the ecosystem in the same way that mempool does. Having a maintainer of the leading implementation who is both maintaining and proposing designs seems like a possible conflict.\r\n\r\nI think an ideal maintainer is someone who is well-grounded enough to have good familiarity with the domain, but who has enough distance to be able to impartially adjudicate the suitability and technical appetite for a PR's merge.\r\n\r\nThere are also specific instances that make me uncertain, albeit to a minor degree, about her judgement as a maintainer. The recent exchange in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25461 does not inspire confidence from my end. Many of Gloria's mempool proposals I heartily support (conceptually at the very least - I'm behind on my review) but proposals that e.g. involve doing fee estimation on the basis of caching block templates (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-March/020124.html) strike me as fairly opinionated and controversial. Of course I don't begrudge people suggesting things that are speculative - it's just tough to dissociate that activity from a place in the (soft) power structure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd then there are ancillary concerns that are a little harder to articulate:\r\n- If maintainership is really just \"janitorial,\" as the refrain commonly goes, and progress in this repo is bottlenecked by review, why do we need more maintainers? Why not just more \"ready for merge?\" pings?\r\n- This is hard to express without coming off as impolite or ad hominem, but we have a pretty large plurality of young maintainers who don't really have a lot of experience in other projects. Furthermore, this plurality seems pretty tightly linked in terms of funding, personal life, etc. to the point where I've heard concern expressed from other contributors that there may be a \"virtuous circle\" of mutual ACKs among maintainers. I'm not trying to criticize or alienate, but I think the potential for weirdness is growing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, all this to say that I'm a huge fan of Gloria's work and I really hope it continues. A lot of Bitcoin's future is contingent on fixing the mempool, and she's been a big part of that over the last two years. I just have various reservations that amount to a -0, which - when considering something like maintainership - defaults to a NACK. \r\n\r\nIf we're going to have another maintainer, I'd like to see someone who is a little further removed, more experienced in the repo, and somewhat more disjoint from the funding/social graph.\r\n\r\nBut I also think we need to back up a little and answer: if maintainers really are just \"janitors,\" why do we need another maintainer? Do we need to revisit the role of maintainers? Should they be expected to take a more active role in setting goals for regions of the system - if so, that's okay (and I think might even solve some problems!) but we should make that explicit instead of just repeating this maintainers-are-just-janitors line while kind of implicitly expecting something else.",
