However, the role does include permissions on the\n+repository, and connotes a general sense of stewardship over the project.\n+\n+\n+Largely, the role of maintainers is to decide to merge Pull Requests. This\n+process is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md), but as an excerpt:\n+\n+> Whether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\n+> maintainers.\n+>\n+> Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\n+> principles of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\n+> judge the general consensus of contributors.\n+\n+Thus maintainers role is not directly elevated above that of regular\n+contributors, as maintainers serve mostly as arbiters of if changes are\n+acceptable to the contributors to the project in aggregate.\n+\n+The role of the Maintainer is currently evolving with respect to \"Scoped\n+Maintainers\". The concept of a scoped maintainer is that it is helpful to add\n+maintainers who are subject matter experts in a particular area of the code,\n+but perhaps not in other areas. As such, maintainers with an explicit scope\n+typically will avoid merging PRs in areas outside their scope, but may do so on\n+occasion. As an individual maintainer's experience levels in the project\n+increase, they may change their focus from scoped to general, but this is not\n+currently an explicit designation (all maintainers should be considered to be\n+general at this time). As a rough measure, scoped maintainers should avoid\n+\"stepping on the toes\" of work that is being guided by another maintainer or\n+contributor.\n+\n+Historically, Bitcoin has also had a \"Lead Maintainer\", which was most recently\n+@laanwj. However, [in a blog\n+post](https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.html), @laanwj stated\n+that they wanted to take more of a background role as a maintainer and have not\n+\"passed the baton\" to a successor as a Lead Maintainer, and instead focused on\n+decentralizing the maintainership ecosystem. As such, while the title of Lead\n+Maintainer still is held by @laanwj, it should be considered a bug-not-feature\n+if it confers any additional responsibility or privilege over other General\n+Maintainers, and may be explicitly deprecated in the future.\n+\n+## Self Merges\n+\n+It is discouraged for maintainers to merge their own work. However, given that\n+there may not be another maintainer who regularly works on the section of code\n+or is familiar, self-merge is not forbidden. However, as a guard, self merges\n+should usually only happen if the following criteria has been met:\n+\n+1. The PR has been reviewed and ACK'd by other regular contributors familiar\n+   with that section of the code.\n+1. There are no NACKs being overruled on that PR.\n+1. The PR is at least 1 week old, to permit time for review.\n+1. The maintainer should communicate intent to self-merge 48 hours before doing so\n+\n+These rules aren't hard and fast, but are considered a best practice to avoid\n+self-merge as a convenience.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Nomination and Selection of Maintainers\n+\n+Being a Maintainer is not an honor (but it may be honorable to serve as one).\n+Many regular contributors who are capable or experienced enough choose not to\n+be a Maintainer. Similarly, just because a regular contributor has reached a\n+certain level of experience does not mean that they \"deserve\" to be a maintainer.\n+\n+Maintainers are added when there is a demonstrated need. For there to be a new\n+maintainer, first an issue should be created with a \"Call for Maintainer\" (C4M)\n+by one of the existing maintainers or regular contributors. C4Ms should specify\n+if the call is for a General Maintainer, or for a Scoped Maintainer. If the\n+role is for a Scoped Maintainer, the C4M should describe the need for a new\n+maintainer, and link to some Pull Requests (or other material) that would be\n+relevant for such a maintainer to be responsible for.\n+\n+Following the C4M, anyone may respond to the issue with a nomination for the\n+position and a description of their qualifications. Self-nomination is\n+encouraged. Nominations must be accepted. After 2 weeks from the date of issue\n+creation, assuming there is at least 1 nomination, the maintainers may select\n+one or more candidate from the nominee pool at their discretion. The selected",
