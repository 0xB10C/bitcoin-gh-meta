I reviewed and tested it by rebasing #24148 and #24149 on top of it, checking the runtime of the fuzz targets and adapting the targets creating \"random\" nodes.\r\n\r\nAs a mean of comparison here are the runtime of the `miniscript_string` and `miniscript_script` targets on my machine\r\nwith the corpus from `qa-assets` at commit 1e3c7cd69fc06fda49a5286b98069ee5b0d64edc:\r\n- Before: `Done 1046 runs in 10 second(s)` and `Done 2908 runs in 13 second(s)`\r\n- After: `Done 1046 runs in 0 second(s)` and `Done 2908 runs in 6 second(s)`\r\n\r\nThis also made the two targets from #24149 twice as fast on average.",
