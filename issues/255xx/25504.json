   "body" : "Wallet descriptors are useful for applications using the Bitcoin Core wallet as a backend for tracking coins, as they allow to track coins for multiple descriptors in a single wallet. However there is no information currently given for such applications to link a coin with an imported descriptor, severely limiting the possibilities for such applications of using multiple descriptors in a single wallet. This PR outputs the matching imported descriptor(s) for a given received coin in `listsinceblock` (and friends).\r\n\r\nIt comes from a need for an application i'm working on, but i think it's something any software using `bitcoind` to track multiple descriptors in a single wallet would have eventually. For instance i'm thinking about the BDK project. Currently, the way to achieve this is to import raw addresses with labels and to have your application be responsible for wallet things like the gap limit.\r\n\r\nI'll add this to the output of `listunspent` too if this gets a few Concept ACKs.",
