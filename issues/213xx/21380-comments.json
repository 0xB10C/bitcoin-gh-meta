      "body" : "Because of the refactoring this will conflict heavily with other changes to versionbits. I've rebased #21377 on top of this at https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202103-speedy-fuzz I think it should be possible to adapt to cover #19573, but haven't tried. It would require some refactoring of the bip8 code in order to be able to catch bugs in the MUST_SIGNAL handling, but maybe that's worthwhile anyway.\r\n\r\nParticularly interested in additional checks that could be added, or better ways of converting fuzz data into interesting chains to test. I've just hardcoded the intervals at 10 minutes, and currently the BIP9 timeouts will precisely match some block's time, which could be missing edge cases? So far it seems pretty reasonable though.",
