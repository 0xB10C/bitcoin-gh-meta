I also think (I could be wrong) a flag day activation stands much less chance of being merged given harding's [F7 argument](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018415.html) and Rusty's \"Developers should not activate\" [argument](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=628) amongst others.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, if a flag day was to have overwhelming consensus I wouldn't Concept NACK it.\r\n\r\n",
