      "body" : "@prairiefalcon Thanks for this great detailed bug report. I have reproduced your given scenarios and can confirm that the bug still exists in the current master branch as of at least 2b5a741e98f186e50d9fbe1ceadcc8b8c91547f7. I have a fix to avoid adding the invalid data to the block files. I will look into creating a way to automatically clean up affected blk files, and will also look into updating the automated tests to catch this going forward.",
