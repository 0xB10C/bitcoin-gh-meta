So I don't think there's any real benefits to doing this via bip8 rather than bip9 as far as the \"Speedy trial\" itself goes; but if bip8/height based code is thoroughly reviewed and ready to merge prior to setting activation parameters, that seems fine too as far as I can see.",

      "body" : "Concept ACK.  Thank you, @ajtowns!  I'm happy to see that the change really is minimal.\r\n\r\nDo I understand correctly from reading the code that activation will occur in the first block of the next retarget period after the `activation_time`?  E.g., if the minimum activation time just passed but the height is 1234, the first block where taproot's rules are enforced still won't be until height 2016?  That seems fine to me for the sake of code simplicity, but it does mean that, if it looks like `activation_time` is going to fall near a retarget block, we'll have to communicate that taproot could either happen tomorrow or two weeks from now.  Maybe to avoid that communication challenge, it'd be better to use a height?\r\n\r\n@michaelfolkson \r\n\r\n> I don't know (though I can guess) why people are trying to refer to BIP 9 now instead of BIP 8, especially as height based activation seems the superior option.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in [my email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018583.html), I thought basing the proposal on the existing BIP9 code in Bitcoin Core (as done in this PR) would be the smallest change and so fastest to get reviewed, merged, and released.  Since the goal of the Speedy Trial proposal is speed (with safety), that seems highly advantageous to me.\r\n\r\nI completely agree that using block heights for the `start` and `timeout` parameters has advantages for this proposal (giving miners a known number of signaling periods) and that, as also mentioned in my email, getting BIP8 included in the code now would have advantages if Speedy Trial fails and we decide to use BIP8 as originally imagined for a follow-up activation attempt.\r\n\r\nMy preference would be for whatever solution is most preferred by reviewers.",

However I'm not convinced we should permanently drop the BIP9 threshold to 90%.\r\n\r\n@JeremyRubin wrote:\r\n\r\n> merging this now is a concrete step, patching to use height can occur independently\r\n\r\nI'm fine with a height based approach too; slightly more code changes, but it seems easier to communicate when things happen. I also agree with Jeremy's point. Nothing here is set in stone until we actually apply it to Taproot (or another soft fork).\r\n\r\nThere is one downside though, in addition to more review work: other implementations probably already have BIP 9 code ready to go. Although compared to implementing all of Taproot this is not a big deal (and without implementing Taproot they can't verify the new consensus rules anyway). \r\n\r\n> Making the case for BIP8 merge first then these changes, the BIP8 code is much more reviewed presently (with no code nacks, just conceptual ones?)\r\n\r\nFor me that's only an option if the `LOT=true` stuff is stripped from that PR.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem terribly complicated to cherry-pick 9762562cc6a2c771ad0ddfb055ea17b90085425c, bcec418304ea3dd524cb3591e4af1b77a04cc968 (though I suggest a fresh BIP for the speedy trial) and a few more.",

At that point replaying the taproot-using transactions people had sent prior to the reorg would allow funds to be stolen as taproot is not yet active after the reorg.",
