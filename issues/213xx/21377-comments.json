So I don't think there's any real benefits to doing this via bip8 rather than bip9 as far as the \"Speedy trial\" itself goes; but if bip8/height based code is thoroughly reviewed and ready to merge prior to setting activation parameters, that seems fine too as far as I can see.",

      "body" : "Concept ACK.  Thank you, @ajtowns!  I'm happy to see that the change really is minimal.\r\n\r\nDo I understand correctly from reading the code that activation will occur in the first block of the next retarget period after the `activation_time`?  E.g., if the minimum activation time just passed but the height is 1234, the first block where taproot's rules are enforced still won't be until height 2016?  That seems fine to me for the sake of code simplicity, but it does mean that, if it looks like `activation_time` is going to fall near a retarget block, we'll have to communicate that taproot could either happen tomorrow or two weeks from now.  Maybe to avoid that communication challenge, it'd be better to use a height?\r\n\r\n@michaelfolkson \r\n\r\n> I don't know (though I can guess) why people are trying to refer to BIP 9 now instead of BIP 8, especially as height based activation seems the superior option.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in [my email](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018583.html), I thought basing the proposal on the existing BIP9 code in Bitcoin Core (as done in this PR) would be the smallest change and so fastest to get reviewed, merged, and released.  Since the goal of the Speedy Trial proposal is speed (with safety), that seems highly advantageous to me.\r\n\r\nI completely agree that using block heights for the `start` and `timeout` parameters has advantages for this proposal (giving miners a known number of signaling periods) and that, as also mentioned in my email, getting BIP8 included in the code now would have advantages if Speedy Trial fails and we decide to use BIP8 as originally imagined for a follow-up activation attempt.\r\n\r\nMy preference would be for whatever solution is most preferred by reviewers.",

However I'm not convinced we should permanently drop the BIP9 threshold to 90%.\r\n\r\n@JeremyRubin wrote:\r\n\r\n> merging this now is a concrete step, patching to use height can occur independently\r\n\r\nI'm fine with a height based approach too; slightly more code changes, but it seems easier to communicate when things happen. I also agree with Jeremy's point. Nothing here is set in stone until we actually apply it to Taproot (or another soft fork).\r\n\r\nThere is one downside though, in addition to more review work: other implementations probably already have BIP 9 code ready to go. Although compared to implementing all of Taproot this is not a big deal (and without implementing Taproot they can't verify the new consensus rules anyway). \r\n\r\n> Making the case for BIP8 merge first then these changes, the BIP8 code is much more reviewed presently (with no code nacks, just conceptual ones?)\r\n\r\nFor me that's only an option if the `LOT=true` stuff is stripped from that PR.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem terribly complicated to cherry-pick 9762562cc6a2c771ad0ddfb055ea17b90085425c, bcec418304ea3dd524cb3591e4af1b77a04cc968 (though I suggest a fresh BIP for the speedy trial) and a few more.",

      "body" : "> but it does mean that, if it looks like `activation_time` is going to fall near a retarget block, we'll have to communicate that taproot could either happen tomorrow or two weeks from now.\r\n\r\nI think it's worse than that -- if `activation_time` falls very near a retarget block, I think you could have the eleven last blocks of the retarget period have timestamps (relative to `activation_time`) like:  `-3000, -2400, -1800, -1200, -600, 0, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 3000` giving the last block a median time which satisfies `MedianTimePast() >= activation_time`, so the next block would switch to ACTIVE and people would likely start transacting with taproot, perhaps even racing to get a tx in the first block as some did with segwit, and setting nlocktime to ensure their transaction isn't mined early and the funds stolen.\r\n\r\nHowever in that case a 2 block reorg could change the last block's timestamp to `-400` (still greater than the mediantime of the prior block which is likely -600), which would change its median time from `0` to `-400`, which would then cause the new first block of the next period to still be in state LOCKED_IN. At that point replaying the taproot-using transactions people had sent prior to the reorg would allow funds to be stolen as taproot is not yet active after the reorg, and nlocktime would not have protected you.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: fixed mediantime rules misinterpretation -- blocks must have a timestamp greater than the previous block's mediantime; block's mediantime does include their own timestamp. And add the following...)\r\n\r\nI think the conclusion from this is just \"the height at which you transition from LOCKED_IN to ACTIVE must be fully determined as soon as you transition from STARTED to LOCKED_IN\". That way the entire LOCKED_IN period has to be reorged if you want to steal funds protected by both nlocktime and the new rules.",

Since the goal of the Speedy Trial proposal is speed (with safety), that seems highly advantageous to me.\r\n\r\nCombined with how minimal this change is- the bulk of this PR is tests, the changes in the source code are +26/-4 lines over 2 commits.\r\n\r\nI've taken a first pass and it all looks reasonable, but I plan to do a full review soon. These changes are simple but I'm currently trying to gain the appropriate codebase context.",
