Many people have noticed their Guix builds failing after\r\nhours simply because they did not remove windeploy (but did remove the\r\ndistsrc-* directories).\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\nguix: Record precious directories and add guix-clean\r\n\r\nMany users have reported problems that stem from having an unclean\r\nworking tree. To that end, I've written a guix-clean script which should\r\nhelp reset the working tree while respecting user-specified precious\r\ndirectories.\r\n\r\nPrecious directories, such as:\r\n\r\n- SOURCES_PATH\r\n- BASE_CACHE\r\n- SDK_PATH\r\n- OUTDIR\r\n\r\nShould be preserved when cleaning the working tree, and are thus\r\nrecorded in ./contrib/guix/var/precious_dirs.\r\n\r\nThe ./contrib/guix/guix-clean script is able to parse that file and make\r\nsure to avoid them when cleaning out the working tree.\r\n```",
