Adding it here makes it more convenient for them.\r\n\r\nThis allows them to mine their high-fee/nonstandard transactions for free.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a miner needs to consolidate lots of outputs, this allows them to finish this in one large tx and for free.\r\n\r\nI might need to rebase it after #21061\r\n\r\nEDIT: I need to fix a few things. Is this Concept ACK for you, however?",
