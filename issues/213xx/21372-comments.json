Particularly because it's not realistic for any external software to enforce softfork safeness, since you need a whole script interpreter to do so -- an obvious thing someone might try to do with this interface is make a \"transaction accelerator\" but in doing so they'd accidentally introduce a public facing network split generator.\r\n",

Mining pool nodes receive full blocks from each other with transactions, adding an unbroadcast transaction wouldn't break anything.\r\n\r\nI aimed to give the miner more control by this change (not every miner has a fork of Core) and now it seems that the best is to add a warning to the RPC description since the last thing a miner wants is a network fork.\r\n\r\nI don't think this feature can be abused, it's only for convenience. For an evil miner, this doesn't make anything easier. They can remove `IsStandard` even now.",
