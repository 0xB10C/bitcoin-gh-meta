They must be specified in depth-first search order, and for a valid tree (sum of 2^-depth must be 0 or 1).\r\n* Support in the script/sign module for producing signatures for these.\r\n\r\nThe part that works and is useful: you can import a `tr(KEY)` descriptor, generate addresses with it, spend coins sent to them using `sendtoaddress` & co.\r\n\r\nBeyond that it has several limitations, and shouldn't be considered feature complete. But the bulk of the work is making sure all the right data gets passed around to the right places. More things can be added later, and should be smaller in scope:\r\n* Support for more interesting scripts inside the tree (only `pk(KEY)` is supported for now). In particular, a multisig policy based on the new `OP_CHECKSIGADD` opcode would be very useful.\r\n* Inferring `tr()` descriptors from outputs (given sufficient information).\r\n* `getaddressinfo` support.\r\n* PSBT support. This in general will require extensions to PSBT to pass around Taproot tree information, signatures, key derivation info for x-only keys.\r\n* MuSig support. Standardizing that is still an ongoing effort, and is generally kind of useless without corresponding PSBT support.\r\n* Convenient ways of constructing descriptors without spendable inner key (especially ones that arent't trivially recognizable as such).",
