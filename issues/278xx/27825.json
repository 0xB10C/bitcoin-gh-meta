   "body" : "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nCurrently `test/lint/lint-logs.py` tries to parse the C++ manually which is prone to flaws. For example it does not support expressions that span more than one line and would be happy if there is `\\n\"` anywhere (on the single line it checks). For example:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n        LogPrintLevel(BCLog::PROXY, \r\n                      BCLog::Level::Debug, \r\n                      \"This is fine, but lint-logs.py will report error\\n\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n        LogPrintLevel(BCLog::PROXY, BCLog::Level::Debug, \"Not ok\\n\"\r\n                      \" but will be reported as ok\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n        LogPrintLevel(BCLog::PROXY, BCLog::Level::Debug, \"even more /* Continued */ no newline, but is ok\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n        /* LogPrintLevel() inside comment causes an error */\r\n```\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n`lint-logs.py` requires to either write everything on line line or add `/* Continued */` comment.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt should be possible to use [libclang](https://pypi.org/project/libclang/) to properly parse the C++ code. Then the check should be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor each call to `LogPrintLevel()`:\r\n    get the third argument:\r\n        it should be a string\r\n        its last two chars should be `\\` and `n`\r\n```\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
