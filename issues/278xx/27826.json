   "body" : "Fixes #27744\r\n\r\nSince #27278 we log received headers. For compact blocks we also log which peer sent it (e5ce8576349d404c466b2f4cab1ca7bf920904b2), but not for regular headers. That required an additional refactor, which this PR provides.\r\n\r\nMove the logging from validation to net_processing.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of log entries (under default configuration) per compact block header from 3 to 2: one for the header and one for the connected tip. That is, in the best case, in practice we may log multiple header announcements.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces a new helper method `LogBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a _compact block_ we call `LogBlockHeader` from the exact same place as where we previously logged. So that log message doesn't change. What does change is that we no longer _also_ log from `AcceptBlockHeader`.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving a regular header(s) message, _we only log the last one_. This is a change in behaviour because it was simpler to implement, but it's probably better anyway. It does mean that if a peer sends of a bunch of headers of which _any_ is invalid, we won't log it (here).\r\n\r\nLastly I expanded the code comment explaining why we log this. It initially only covered selfish mining, but we also care about peers sending us headers but not following up (see e.g. #27626).\r\n\r\nExample log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-05T11:50:30Z Saw new cmpctblock header hash=000000000000000000042a2c4e3910c5ccd48b4b2d624f08b4b5a413b98af4ea height=792960 peer=9\r\n2023-06-05T11:50:30Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000042a2c4e3910c5ccd48b4b2d624f08b4b5a413b98af4ea height=792960 peer=6\r\n2023-06-05T11:50:31Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000042a2c4e3910c5ccd48b4b2d624f08b4b5a413b98af4ea height=792960 peer=13\r\n2023-06-05T11:50:31Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000042a2c4e3910c5ccd48b4b2d624f08b4b5a413b98af4ea height=792960 peer=16\r\n2023-06-05T11:50:31Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000042a2c4e3910c5ccd48b4b2d624f08b4b5a413b98af4ea height=792960 peer=15\r\n2023-06-05T11:50:31Z UpdateTip: new best=000000000000000000042a2c4e3910c5ccd48b4b2d624f08b4b5a413b98af4ea height=792960 version=0x20000000 log2_work=94.223043 tx=848167913 date='2023-06-05T11:50:20Z' progress=1.000000 cache=1194.3MiB(9437428txo)\r\n2023-06-05T11:50:31Z Saw new header hash=000000000000000000042a2c4e3910c5ccd48b4b2d624f08b4b5a413b98af4ea height=792960 peer=3\r\n```",
