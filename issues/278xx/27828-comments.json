I believe this may still be a bug with (json object) not being noted as required or optional.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be more of a display issue with `RPCArg::Type::OBJ` and the corresponding `RPCArg::Optional::OMITTED` perhaps?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/rawtransaction.cpp#L160\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/rpc/spend.cpp#L971\r\n\r\nSeems there are some examples of arrays, strings, objs, and other things that are picking up on this `RPCArg::Optional::<VAL>` to populate the display with either optional or required. Not sure which piece of code is responsible for this.",
