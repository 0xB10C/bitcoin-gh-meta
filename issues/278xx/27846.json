   "body" : "I discovered via fuzzing of another coin selection approach that at extremely high feerates SRD may find input sets that lead to transactions without change outputs. This is an unintended outcome since SRD is meant to always produce a transaction with a change outputâwe use other algorithms to specifically search for changeless solutions.\r\n\r\nThe issue occures when the flat allowance of 50,000â¯á¹© for change is insufficient to pay for the creation of a change output with a non-dust amount, at and above 1,613â¯á¹©/vB. Increasing the change budget by change_fees makes SRD behave as expected at any feerates.",
