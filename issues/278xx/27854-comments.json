      "body" : "What are the reasons for not having this as a separate piece of software that calls the Bitcoin Core RPCs? From glancing at the code here it seems like `getblocktemplate` and `submitblock` would be the only needed RPCs. I've seen the discussion about separation (multi-process) in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049 but wasn't convinced by the arguments there (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23049#issuecomment-926009122). I am worried about the maintenance burden of this and would prefer it being a separate thing.\r\n\r\nIf stratumv3 or \"some other cool new mining protocol\" comes out tomorrow, are we gonna add support for that too? In my opinion, Bitcoin Core's interfaces should accommodate projects like this but direct integration should be reserved for strictly necessary things.",
