   "body" : "This pull request is part of a larger effort towards improving the shutdown / abort / fatal error handling in validation code. It is a first step towards implementing proper fatal error return type enforcement similar as proposed by theuni in this pull request [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1563561502). For ease of review of these critical changes, a first step would be checking that `AbortNode` leads to early and error-conveying returns at its call site. Further work for enforcing returns when `AbortNode` is called is done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27862.\r\n\r\nAny required behavior change further up the call stack of these functions is not handled here, but will be tackled in future pull requests. Further changes required are similarly sensitive and I hope this incremental approach will allow for more focused review.",
