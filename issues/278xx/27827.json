   "body" : "This PR implements the basic silent payments scheme. In particular:\r\n\r\n* Adds support for existing wallets to send to silent payment addresses\r\n* Adds support to the Bitcoin Core wallet for receiving silent payments\r\n\r\nThe following items are not covered in this PR and are intended for follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n* Adding labels for the receiver wallet\r\n* Creating multiple outputs for the same silent payment address when sending\r\n* Full RPC coverage (only `send` is covered in this PR)\r\n* Light client support (vending the tweak data per block, either in an index or to serve to an indexer, such as electrum)\r\n* More unit / functional test coverage\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24897, where most of the follow-ups have been fully or partially implemented.\r\n\r\nFor the silent payments specification, see [BIP-silent-payments](https://github.com/josibake/bips/blob/silent-payments-bip-draft/bip-0000.mediawiki)\r\n\r\n## Notes for the reviewers\r\n\r\nThere are a few parts of this PR that need re-working but are implementation details and not specific to how silent payments work. I decided to open the PR as-is so that folks reviewing the BIP have an implementation to look at and to get some suggestions on how to better implement this in the wallet. Specifically, I'm looking for feedback on how to improve the following:\r\n\r\n* The `sp()` descriptor should be updated to implement the BIP and independently derive the scan key (currently it's just a hash of the spend key)\r\n* Each silent payment output found is added to the wallet as a `rawtr` descriptor. Ideally, we have a new descriptor that takes the spend key and then stores the auxiliary data needed to construct the private key (e.g `sp(spend_key, <one of hash(ecdh_shared_secret>)`\r\n* Some of the methods could probably be better organized (e.g implemented on the SPKMan, when it could be a wallet method)",
