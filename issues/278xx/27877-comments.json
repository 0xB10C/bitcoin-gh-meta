      "body" : "Thanks for exploring this, I think this is an interesting idea! I'll comment based on my specific usage of the wallet for lightning service providers, please bear in mind that this is a very specific use case that is quite different from regular users (see #24795 for early details about this).\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the current goals of coin selection are that it tries to find a good balance between minimizing fees and consolidating utxos. The latter actually helps the former: consolidating utxos is usually good for performance, and if you do it when fees are low, you will avoid paying more fees in the future when fees are higher because you'll be able to use less inputs in your future transactions.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a lightning service provider, we'd rather avoid consolidating utxos, and are ready to pay more fees to keep a large enough utxo set to satisfy our users' needs. The main reasons for that are that:\r\n\r\n- we are using 0-conf (in a setup where the user is trusting us to not double-spend)\r\n- we are using low fees for those transactions (it's ok to keep transactions unconfirmed until the mempool clears, this is how we can keep the cost low for users)\r\n- the change outputs from most of those transactions are _unsafe_ because they may be double-spent by a commitment transaction (and thus generally unusable until the the transaction confirms, except when used for that same user)\r\n\r\nThat last point is a consequence of [splicing](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/863), let me know if you want me to explain that point in more details.\r\n\r\nIf we run out of _safe_ utxos, we cannot onboard new users, which may require us to transfer funds from a cold wallet while making sure we're creating many utxos, at a time where the on-chain fees may be high. Our ideal wallet would maintain a large pool of utxos of various sizes, to ensure we're always ready to onboard new users or sell liquidity to existing users.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is the opposite of what most end users want and can't be achieved by the same algorithm: that's why I would find it very useful to have various coin selection algorithms in bitcoin core, that are tuned to different profiles/scenarios. I like that this algorithm feels like something we could use (at all feerates) to keep a wallet state that makes more sense for us.",

Your comment inspired a small optimization. \r\nCoinGrinder has been simplified by keeping only track of the input weight (instead of weight and waste), and minimizing input weight throughout. This reduced the number of parameters necessary to call CoinGrinder, simplified the input set traversal, and allows CoinGrinder to be used at all feerates instead of just high feerates.
