   "body" : "Since ea7b8528 (#26422), `autogen.sh` overwrites the `build-aux/config.{guess, sub}` files (installed there by `autoreconf`) with the `depends/config.{guess, sub}` files if these are newer.\r\n\r\nThe `autoreconf` tool copies them from it's `share/autoconf/build-aux/` directory. Specifically on NixOS, the `share/autoconf/build-aux/` files are located in the nix-store and are read-only. `autoreconf` preserves the read-only permissions when copying. Overwriting them with our `depends/config.{guess, sub}` files subsequently fails.\r\n\r\nTo make sure we can overwrite the files, set write permissions to the current user and group before overwriting. This fixes the problem on NixOS.\r\n\r\nfixes #27873",
