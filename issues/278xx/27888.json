   "body" : "The current descriptor parsing fuzz target requires valid public or private keys to be provided. This is unnecessary as we are only interested in fuzzing the descriptor parsing logic here (other targets are focused on fuzzing keys serializations). And it's pretty inefficient, especially for formats that need a checksum (`xpub`, `xprv`, WIF).\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new target that mocks the keys as an index in a list of precomputed keys. Keys are represented as 2 hex characters in the descriptor. The key type (private, public, extended, ..) is deterministically based on this one-byte value. Keys are deterministically generated at target initialization. This is much more efficient and also largely reduces the size of the seeds.\r\nTL;DR: for instance instead of requiring the fuzzer to generate a `pk(xpub6DdBu7pBoyf7RjnUVhg8y6LFCfca2QAGJ39FcsgXM52Pg7eejUHLBJn4gNMey5dacyt4AjvKzdTQiuLfRdK8rSzyqZPJmNAcYZ9kVVEz4kj)` to parse a valid descriptor, it just needs to generate a `pk(03)`.\r\n\r\nNote we only mock the keys themselves, not the entire descriptor key expression. As we want to fuzz the real code that parses the rest of the key expression (origin, derivation paths, ..).\r\n\r\nThis is a target i used for reviewing #17190 and #27255, and figured it was worth PR'ing on its own since the added complexity for mocking the keys is minimal and it could help prevent introducing bugs to the descriptor parsing logic much more efficiently.",
