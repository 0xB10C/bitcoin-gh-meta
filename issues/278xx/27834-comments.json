      "body" : "> why are there no issues posted about these intermittent failures\r\n\r\nBecause no one reported them. But they do exist, if you grep for \"Warning: An error occurred while preparing SDK package Android Emulator: Connection reset.\" For example, https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5766445213155328?logs=build#L2700\r\n\r\n> It's great to speed up a task, and I wish all tasks could run as quickly as possible;\r\n\r\nIt only checks that it can build, and doesn't run any tests, so I hope the other tasks remain to run the tests.\r\n\r\n> This feels, in a small way, motivated by the want to remove the GUI by some.\r\n\r\nI think this is a far stretch. I've never encouraged to remove the GUI and would strongly object the removal. What this does is remove the Android task from the CI config, nothing more. The CI env is explicitly kept, to be able to continue running the task outside. And in fact it is already running on a nightly basis on my nightly CI repo: https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5872120266227712 , along with other important to check tasks that have no place in this repo.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say this is also no attempt to remove Android compatibility. I agree with you that this is an important platform and demographic to support.\r\n\r\nThis is merely removing a task that is failing more often due to unrelated issues (network) than to indicate a useful result (true red CI). If you disagree it would be helpful to demonstrate or link to one instance where this task has caught or would have caught an issue.\r\n\r\nI don't feel too strongly, and I am happy to close this, but I think we should be having a discussion based on real data points and not feelings.",
