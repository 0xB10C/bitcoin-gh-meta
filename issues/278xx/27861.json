   "body" : "Get rid of all `ShutdownRequested` calls in validation code by introducing an interrupt object that applications can use to cancel long-running kernel operations.\r\n\r\nReplace all `AbortNode` calls in validation code with new fatal error and flush error notifications so kernel applications can be notified about failures and choose how to handle them. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis pull request is part of the `libbitcoinkernel` project https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587 https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/projects/3 and more specifically its \"Step 2: Decouple most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel\".\r\n\r\nThe pull request mostly allows dropping the kernel dependency on shutdown.cpp. The only dependency left after this is a `StartShutdown` call which will be removed in followup PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711. This PR also drops the last reference to the `uiInterface` global in kernel code. The process of moving the `uiInterface` out of the kernel was started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27636.\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains a subset of patches originally proposed in #27711. It will be part of a series of changes required to make handling of interrupts (or in other words the current shutdown procedure) in the kernel library more transparent and less reliable on global mutable state. The set of patches contained here was originally proposed by @ryanofsky [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1580779869). ",
