How would someone properly indicate the \"data\" is optional if not specifying it as optional? The parent output is required and some of it's children elements are optional. From my perspective what I would expect to see is a required \"outputs\" and within outputs there being required and optional fields. \r\n\r\nFor instance: `\"address\": amount,           (numeric or string, required` makes sense as address and amount are necessary.\r\nBut `\"data\": \"hex\",               (string, required)` seems like a bug because this is not required and can be left out.
