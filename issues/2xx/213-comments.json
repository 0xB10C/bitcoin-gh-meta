I thought I was building from scratch, but I think what happened was:\r\n\r\n* I initially built using stock bitcoin source (no makefile tweaks)\r\n* That failed since I don't have the UPNP library.\r\n* Then I tweaked makefile.unix to have \"USE_UPNP:=\"\r\n* ...and that gave me the error described in issue #212.\r\n\r\nSo this indeed only seems to be an issue when you build with stale object files in /obj.\r\nStill, I think the above series of steps are probably not uncommon, among people who lack the upnp library, so I think it's a build use-case that's worth being concerned about. :)",
