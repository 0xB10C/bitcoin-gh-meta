So imo another reason to remove the \"feature\"\r\n\r\nI think there's a difference between *encouraging* users to change behaviour and pulling a feature out from under them. We really don't have a good picture of how users use our code, so I'd always err on the side of caution when deprecating features.\r\n\r\nI'm going to modify my mild concept ACK with a merge-NACK-until-this-has-been-more-widely-discussed. We're probably fine, but it seems to me that any P2P change that was added to Bitcoin Core with a BIP should be removed after public discussion.\r\n\r\nHere's how I expect it'll go: someone will post a mail to the bitcoin-core mailing list saying \"I propose to remove REJECT messages in Bitcoin Core v0.19\", no-one will respond, and then we'll remove them. I'm happy to send that post if you'd prefer not to.",
