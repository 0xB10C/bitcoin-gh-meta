A key that has been imported is one which has been exposed in plaintext and should thus be considered compromised. It would be unsafe to continue to use such a private key. Furthermore, private keys which are imported are often ones that have already been used. If a used key were imported to the keypool, it will lead to accidental address reuse which we should avoid.\r\n\r\n>  creates an unsigned PSBT in a wallet without private keys and then signs it in a wallet with those private keys (which simulates an external hardware wallet). There are probably other ways I can build that test though.\r\n\r\nWhy can't you create the wallet with the private keys and then import the pubkeys into another wallet?",
