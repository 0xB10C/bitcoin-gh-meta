      "body" : "@sdaftuar went and tested and realized at least I and a few others had a misunderstanding in #10178 - the intended goal of all this logic is to hide orphaned coinbases, but it, as far as I can tell, was always broken in >1 block reorgs (even prior to #10178), and I'm still dubious about having this logic in order to have that behavior - how is a coinbase transaction paying you getting orphaned any different from any other transaction paying you getting conflicted - it seems crazy to hide such transactions entirely because they got orphaned.",
