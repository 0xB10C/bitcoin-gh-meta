I was on the fence about whether changing the prioritisetransaction RPC was an acceptable change, but group consensus seemed to be that it should be done. I'm still on the fence, but now that #9602 has been merged I don't think it makes sense to re-open this issue.\r\n\r\nAs for rationale, I don't think making RPC 'compatible' other implementations should be a consideration for bitcoin core. The RPC interface is an implementation decision. If other bitcoin implementations wish to implement the bitcoin core RPC interface that's fine, but it shouldn't drive core's decisions.",
