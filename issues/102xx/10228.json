This change makes sure that autoheader is re-run (as it's supposed to be) any time configure.ac is touched.\r\n\r\nAlso, this undoes #4322, as it would introduce an infinite loop otherwise. I suspect that these convenience targets get very little use anymore, but we can always add back hard-coded ones if necessary.\r\n\r\n",
