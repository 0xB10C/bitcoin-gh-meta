      "body" : "@jonasschnelli , all - perhaps the title of this commit is wrong (it does not prevent reuse globally) - I was trying to solve the issue in #10065 and would like to get @RHavar 's opinion on this approach, since his use case was:\r\nPeople send tiny amounts to well known addresses in his wallet.\r\nThe coin selection mechanism continually spends those outputs, tainting most outgoing transactions.\r\nHe was looking for a (persistent) way to exclude certain well known addresses from the coin selection algorithm.\r\n(RPC calls to display amounts/addresses TBD if the overall idea works).\r\n> An advanced wallet feature should be the ability to disable all address reuse. The attack this is designed to stop is if I know that the address 1BPmZt3kjnFffANNs6MCBBBKRYwRGGrXQZ is part of Alice's wallet, it shouldn't be possible to continually pepper it with dust and learn more about her as her wallet automatically keeps spend-linking it with her other outgoing transactions.",
