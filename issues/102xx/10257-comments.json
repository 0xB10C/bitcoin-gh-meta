It should be acceptable for the wallet implementation to vary this, there's no reason to force a certain allocation policy.\r\n\r\nI guess a requirement \"at least 32 bytes of locked memory should be allocated per key\" would do? Then check at the end versus the beginning, and not so much whether it gets allocated in 32 byte increments.\r\n",
