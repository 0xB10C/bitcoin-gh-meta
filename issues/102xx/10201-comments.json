Just by equaling it I would be more than happy to close #10227, but it occurs to me that I didn't do an exhaustive search on all the functions in validation.o that could be made static (independently on whether they use CChainParams or Consensus::Params or not). If you do that, I bet not only nobody will complain for increasing the scope of a PR with 3 acks but people will actually praise you (at least I will) for every new function that can be static you find apart from the 3 in #10227.\r\nI think it's also a more interesting and rewarding task than what #7829 proposes alone.\r\n\r\nEDIT: or maybe a separated PR for that makes more sense, I'm not sure\r\n",
