Useful to have tests that \"just call it\", but to really qualify it as \"tests listaddressgroupings\" you might want to also create a few test addresses, create some raw transactions to them, test that addresses shared in the input are grouped which weren't previously, and then test that the groupings are transitive (ie if you have a transaction with inputs from address A & B, and another from addresses B & C, there is now one group with all three grouped, despite it being in separate transactions). If you dont want to bite that much off, still good to have these tests, but maybe dont add it to the list of \"tested RPCs\" at the top, and maybe we should have a blacklist on the coverage meter at the end.",

That means the node has 2 coinbase rewards of 50BTC, which are unlinkable and so should be in different groupings.\r\n- construct a single transaction which sends 25 BTC from each address to an external address. The two originating addresses are now linkable and so should be in the same grouping.\r\n\r\nIf you make this change, there shouldn't be a change in the balance, so :crossed_fingers: it shouldn't break anything further down in the test.",
