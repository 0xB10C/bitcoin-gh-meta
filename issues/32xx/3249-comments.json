The problem is that javascript (which is at the base of JSON), as well as many other implementations, use doubles for number representation. Double is a *floating point* format, which means that the mantissa has a limited precision, not the number of decimals after the dot.\r\n\r\nSure, you can patch your JSON RPC parser to use integers instead, or maybe yours does already, but if you are going to patch your JSON RPC parser you can do it just as well in the current situation: make it return a Decimal or fixed point format for numbers.\r\n\r\nBtw @luke-jr, what you say is not entirely correct, we indeed use uint64 as internal format but we do use doubles in the intermediate conversion for JSON RPC, see \r\n\r\n    int64_t AmountFromValue(const Value& value)\r\n    {\r\n        double dAmount = value.get_real();\r\n        if (dAmount <= 0.0 || dAmount > 21000000.0)\r\n            throw JSONRPCError(RPC_TYPE_ERROR, \"Invalid amount\");\r\n        int64_t nAmount = roundint64(dAmount * COIN);\r\n        if (!MoneyRange(nAmount))\r\n            throw JSONRPCError(RPC_TYPE_ERROR, \"Invalid amount\");\r\n        return nAmount;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Value ValueFromAmount(int64_t amount)\r\n    {\r\n        return (double)amount / (double)COIN;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis has caused an issue at least once with an upgrade of json::spirit. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3126 which somehow formatted numbers differently.\r\n\r\n*When we'd use strings we could avoid converting to double intermediate format at all and be fixed-point all the way to the client.*\r\n\r\n",
