Maybe with a checkbox \"show watch-only\".\r\nI would add my brainwallet outputs as watch-only. It would be nice, if I could see those outputs in the coin control popup. Maybe even enabled, so I can play around with them. CreateTransaction should just fail, I guess, if you try to spend watch-only. Coin control is an expert-only feature anyway.\r\nThose outputs could be marked with an \"eye-icon\" for example. What do you think?",
