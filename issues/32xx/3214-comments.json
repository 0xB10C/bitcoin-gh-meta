The wallet is arguably far more sensitive than the blocks, but since there is a huge difference in size between the wallet and blocks it would make things a lot more practical to only have to put the wallet on an encrypted drive. Right now I have the blockchain and wallet.dat on a network drive (don't have enough local storage for the blockchain). In addition it might be worth not auto-generating a new wallet.dat if a walletdir argument is given too, as in this case it probably just means the user hasn't mounted their wallet's secure vault.",

Of course it could be subdivided further if useful, but the most common case would be this.\r\n",
