At 20:02:44 your node marked peer 1 as \"timed out, disconnect\" and at 20:03:11 you processed a message from it, which is likely an indication that your disk was pegged making the import thread take a while.\r\n\r\nI assume the Monero chain's ringsigs make it more CPU intensive than Bitcoin's (especially with assumevalid), so its not hugely surprising that Bitcoin may be slower to sync. You might try running on the SSD with -prune enabled.\r\n\r\nNote that -dbcache also has an overhead to flush, and so you may notice that its mostly \"not used\" during normal runtime except for brief spikes, this should be fixed in 0.15, which should be much less disk intensive during initial sync.",

And estimated time left until synced: \"%n second\". Its using 1.4MB/s of my disk (my total disk usage says 25%), about .8% cpu (total being 11%), and 45MB (total used being 86%). I don't have enough space on my SSD, unfortunately, to store the blockchain. \r\n\r\nSo would you guess that 0.15 will fix my problems? This has been a huge problem for me - I wouldn't have been able to use any bitcoin for the last month if I didn't accidentally leave a few in my coinbase account. This really makes me want to just switch to electrum or something. ",
