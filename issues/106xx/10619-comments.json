If so I think it makes sense to make that clear (via an assertion) since the code here appears to be working under that assumption. It will have the added benefit of silencing this NULL pointer dereference warning for static analysis tools that don't pick up this subtle state change limitation (if such a limitation exists).\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting this @pavlosantoniou. You beat me to reporting it! :-) I had this in my backlog of possible NULL pointer dereferences to report, but as I try to limit the number of open PR:s pertaining to the same class of issues I figured I'd await the merge of a similar issue I reported in #9549:\r\n> [[net] Avoid possibility of NULL pointer dereference in MarkBlockAsInFlight(...)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9549)",
