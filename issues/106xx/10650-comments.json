If I were designing a bitcoin JSON-RPC API from scratch, I'd require a fixed, basic, future-proof request-uri like `/api/v1` and require request options to be specified in JSON-RPC parameters, not in out-of-band url path extensions, or query strings, or http headers.\r\n\r\nBut in this case we're talking about updating an existing JSON-RPC API with dozens of commands that already have their own ways of interpreting JSON-RPC parameters and that all assume they'll be interacting with a single wallet. So for backwards compatability, I think it's a good idea to allow an out-of-band `wallet=filename` option that can be tacked on to the request-uri query string and onto the bitcoin-cli command line, and that will control which wallet the existing API methods will access by default, without having to update dozens of individual method implementations, or change API in an incompatible way.\r\n\r\nI think if you want to come up with complicated new URL schemes or authorization schemes to provide more structured and controlled access to the API, that could be great, but it goes beyond what you need for basic backward-compatible multiwallet support, which is a simple `wallet=filename` option that you can tack on to requests and command lines.",
