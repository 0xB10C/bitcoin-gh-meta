The size checks\r\n that use it would not behave any differently consensus wise\r\n if they were eliminated completely.\r\n\r\nIts correct value is not independently settable but is a function\r\n of the weight limit and weight formula.\r\n\r\nThis patch just eliminates it and uses the scale factor as\r\n required to compute the worse case constants.  It's an alternative\r\n to another PR that adds a long comment that seemingly was still\r\n not sufficient.",
