      "body" : "getrawtransaction currently works with pruned nodes as long as the transaction has at least one unspent output. I believe this functionality is deprecated though.\r\n\r\nThe point of pruning is to throw away transactions that are no longer needed, and the point of txindex is to be able to search for old transactions by their transaction id. I'm not entirely sure these concepts are very compatible.\r\n\r\nI guess it would be theoretically possible to have a txindex for all transactions that aren't pruned, but this seems a little weird. \r\n",
