I don't have the Qt stuff installed, so I can't really see -- but what happens in the UI? Surely you don't see an impossible-to-confirm transaction as perpetually \"pending\"...   That'd be a pretty serious bug.\r\n\r\n> I'm curious what other issues you have with listsinceblock? I assume there's issues for them?\r\n\r\nCan't really remember how many of them have issues or not, but I can file them if there's any interest in making it work properly.\r\n\r\nBut really the first step in fixing it though would be writing some extensive description of what the behavior *should* be (especially in the edge cases: conflicts, replaced, this issue, sending-to-self etc) and then it would be a lot easier to see if it makes sense or not -- and report deviations of it. Right now it's pretty wtf, and you can't tell if it's intentional or not. Like the `blockhash` filter doesn't even work for conflicted transactions (at least when I tried a year ago)",
