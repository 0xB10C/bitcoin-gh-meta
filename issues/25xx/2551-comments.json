For example:\r\nAn address is generated for the exclusive use of gathering and sharing diagnostic data\r\nOnce the address is used for volunteering information, it can no longer be used for normal transactions\r\nThe address can only send/receive small amounts of bitcoin.\r\nThe address cannot accumulate more than xyz maximum amount of bitcoin\r\nThe volunteer mode sends/receives transactions only to other volunteer addresses continuously and at random.\r\n\r\nSome other possibilities:\r\nThe addresses are \"owned\" by the developer team and loaned out to the volunteer computers.  If the volunteer computer does not have any activity over the course of xyz days/months/etc. its address is returned to the developer team for reuse.\r\nTo minimize the potential for abuse, the volunteer program is limited and requires registration/approval from a moderator.\r\n\r\nI know this is not perfect, but maybe it's a starting point for a general idea that could be improved with feedback from others?",

Could be optional but recommended upon the next startup. I don't know if this would necessitate sending the crashdump on some sort of delay until the wallet is secured again.
