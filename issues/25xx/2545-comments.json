Backups. I suppose backup commands could fetch all keys from the keychain first\r\n2. macOS might prompt user for keychain access at weird moments, as it needs to save more keys\r\n3. Multiple wallet support (#11383 / #12610)\r\n4. Wallet encryption support (is the value that's stored in the key chain encrypted?)\r\n5. How do we warn the user that they shouldn't delete their keychain and take those keys with them when moving to a new machine?\r\n",
