Then\r\n   call bumpfee providing such output (in the \"outputs\" arg).\r\n\r\nCurrently, this is not possible. The wallet fails with\r\n\"Unable to create transaction. Transaction must have at least\r\none recipient\" error.\r\nThe error reason is that we discard the provided output from\r\nthe recipients list and set it inside the coin control\r\nso the process adds it later (when the change is calculated).\r\nBut.. there is no later if the tx has no outputs.",
