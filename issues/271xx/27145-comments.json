      "body" : "Concept ACK on refreshing state of conflicted transactions in the wallet when a block is disconnected. I think there is a potential problem with the implementation though because it isn't recursively marking conflicted transactions as unconfirmed, only marking the top level transactions without recursing.\r\n\r\nI think a good approach could be to steal from the previous implementation of this idea in commits b8b4592d985fa36dd0dddfd0e2bc6daf8df6e79c and 3c8bd6814ca88715d3d56994b10dc2c5f3e38e2d from #17543, which did recurse. That approach was also nice because it reused the existing MarkConflicted function in order to avoid code duplication. Commit ec5a89a26fa17e68b3e5928730e7d7c3e0370729 from that PR also added some more test coverage which could be used here.",
