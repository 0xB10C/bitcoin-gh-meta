If it is important for the RPC client to know how many warnings have been returned in order to display them on separate lines, it seems best after this to gradually replace the `warning` string field with a `warnings` JSON array of strings, as we do in several other RPCs.  I'm happy to do that in a follow-up, as it would be orthogonal to this change: first the `warnings` field would be added and the `warning` field deprecated, then after a release or so the latter could possibly be removed.  In the meantime, this is a simple and focused fix.\r\n\r\n@pinheadmz (Thanks!) Saw those for (maybe, maybe not) another pull; prefer to keep this small and focused.",
