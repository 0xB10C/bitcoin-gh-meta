This explains why util.c gets linked against the wrong definition of time() with the wrong size.\r\n\r\nBuilding with optimization (even `-O`) should fix the immediate problem. I'm fairly sure of this, as I accidentally fixed it once by adding `-g -O` and thought it was the debug info that made the problem go away.\r\n\r\n(and having different time_t sizes in different dependencies is not nice either... probably something to look at too, as it could cause problems if they're exchanging time_t's, but it's one step...)\r\n",
