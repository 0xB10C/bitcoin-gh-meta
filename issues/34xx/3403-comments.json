Right now, we never ban localhost, and that isn't optimal, as it means never banning incoming onion connections.\r\n* We could have a -whiteport, which adds another P2P listening port, but connections to it are automatically whitelisted. For outgoing connections, a -addwhitenode or something could exist. In general, I don't think using IP-based filtering is optimal here - for outgoing connections you want to connect to them anyway, and for incoming connections IP filtering doesn't suffice.",

I vaguely remember some discussion on IRC a while ago and we came up with that solution as preferable, as it allows using the existing network access control to determine who gets 'preferred' access, but I don't know anymore who was involved in that discussion.\r\n",
