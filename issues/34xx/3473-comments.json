However your proposed alternative would have even worse usability. If you want to help people log in to websites more securely, improving web browsers and making it easier to configure servers would be a good idea. Some suggestions are here:\r\n\r\nhttp://eprint.iacr.org/2013/538.pdf\r\n\r\nAbility to extract a pubkey from a signature is not harmful or anything like that, but you could easily do it with a bit of custom code too, so it's not really clear this is a particularly useful RPC. Do you have any use cases for it which are NOT web site logins?",
