Busted during upgrade?\r\n2. libboost1.54-all-dev is not the default boost for Saucy.\r\n\r\n- libboost-all-dev is a virtual package that installs the default recommended version, which is 1.5.3. See here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/libboost-all-dev\r\n- libboost1.54-all-dev can be installed directly, overriding the virtual. Apparently that was done here.\r\n\r\nHere's the fun part. Compare:\r\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/amd64/libboost-filesystem1.53-dev/filelist\r\nand\r\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/saucy/amd64/libboost-filesystem1.54-dev/filelist\r\n\r\n1.54 does not use a multi-arch layout while 1.53 does. I'd say that's a bug/accident. It seems this was fixed in Trusty:\r\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/amd64/libboost-filesystem1.54-dev/filelist\r\n\r\nAssumptions we make while looking for boost:\r\n\r\n- We assume that given /usr/lib/libboost_system.so and /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_system.so, the latter is the one we want since it's the more recent layout. This matches the linker's search order (gcc -print-search-dirs to verify), so it's (imo) the only sane option.\r\n- We assume that all boost libs live in the same place, unless --with-boost-foo is used to specify otherwise.\r\n\r\nI think those are reasonable assumptions.\r\n\r\nSo the scenario where things would break would be:\r\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_system.* exists (boost-system 1.53)\r\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_filesystem does not exist. (boost-all 1.54 and not boost-filesystem 1.53)\r\n\r\nMy guess is that 1.54 is fully installed, but 1.53 isn't. 1.53 takes precedence in this case since it uses the new layout as opposed to the buggy 1.54.\r\n\r\nInstalling libboost1.53-all-dev or removing all remaining libboost1.53-* should fix i think. If so, we can just chalk it up to the combo of an Ubuntu bug and a local issue.",
