See this example [https://bitcoind.observer/p2p-network-traffic](https://bitcoind.observer/d/Z3_pFfZnz/p2p-network-traffic?orgId=1&refresh=30s) and code https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoind-observer.\r\n\r\n> Prevention of eclipse-attacks, ASN distribution among addrman\r\n\r\nI've added a few tracepoints (not in a PR yet) to addrman to externally observe the `new` and `tried` tables too. See e.g. [this realtime visualization](https://twitter.com/0xB10C/status/1407019872681332742/photo/1) (colors are addr type here, but could also be AS based) of my addrman tables:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19157360/128023646-1f0f953f-99ab-4430-a9b8-aaa950ad2b04.png)\r\n\r\nLet if you think this might be an alternative to a module in Bitcoin Core.
