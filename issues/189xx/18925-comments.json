      "body" : "So for every new heavy task that is added to the scheduler we have to add one more thread to not degrade the worst case performance? Imagine the wallet is flushed on scheduler thread 1 and the dns is queried on scheduler thread 2. Both block for minutes, so a third scheduler thread is needed. Sounds like this is missing the goal, and you might as well start a plain thread for each heavy task to begin with.\r\n\r\nI think what is needed is to have different queues. Maybe one for the validation interface (which validation might block on in the worst case), and other stuff like the wallet flushing or dns requests.",
