Have you in mind other alternative which needs a really specific threading model ? That's a bit more complexity but you may allocate priority to avoid starvation.\r\n\r\nI agree that the `mapNodeState` isn't great and ideally you do want to defer every peer policy to the driver. Reducing state is less error-prone.\r\n\r\n@icota Do you have in mind a different ipv4/ipv6 flow that the one implemented by main net ? Path-aware routing could be cool and definitely something belonging there. ",
