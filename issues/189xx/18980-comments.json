There's no need to peek into git. Releases are built from a tag and every tag needs to have unique major/minor/build/rc numbers anyhow. Furthermore, my [make-tag](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/blob/master/make-tag.py) script verifies that these numbers match before making and signing the tag.\r\n\r\nThere is one time it's useful to look at git during the build process: if someone builds from git source, to be able to see the commit they built from in the program. This is somewhat useful for developers but if it causes too much difficulty and complexity (how many times has then been 'fixed' throughout Bitcoin Core's history?) I'm okay with foregoing it.",
