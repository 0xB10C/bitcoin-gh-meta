   "body" : "This builds off #18468 since it simplifies this PR a bunch. Review that first.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid many unnecessary `std::vector` allocations by changing\r\n`CBloomFilter` to take `Span`s instead of `std::vector`s for the `insert`\r\nand `contains` operations.\r\n\r\n`CBloomFilter` currently converts types such as `CDataStream` and `uint256`\r\nto `std::vector` on `insert` and `contains`. This is unnecessary because\r\n`CDataStream`s and `uint256`s are already `std::vectors` internally. We just\r\nneed a way to point to the right data within those types. `Span` gives\r\nus this ability.\r\n\r\nThis is a part of the Zero Allocations Project #18849 (ZAP3). This code came up as a place where many allocations occur. Mainly due to allocations of `CService::GetKey` which is passed to these functions, but this PR is needed before we get to that.\r\n",
