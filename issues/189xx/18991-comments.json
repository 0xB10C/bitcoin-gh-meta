It's really something making sense only in the p2p context. We would never use this cache for any local stuff. But let's see what other reviewers think about it?\r\n\r\n> I wonder what implications this might have in advertising new peers, i.e. suppose the 24 hour window rolls over right before your daemon sees a new peer.

Nodes don't send many GETADDRs, and one should be lucky to get that new node randomly.\r\nI think the primary method of advertising new peers is them calling `AdvertiseLocal` and forwarding unsolicited ADDR messages. And that one remains unaffected by this change.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in future I'm planning to suggest doing `AdvertiseLocal` for feeler connections or other random connections, it should help both privacy and better addresss relay.",

Previously they would have to make 100 requests and compare across nodes, now they'd have to make just one.\r\n\r\nBut it would be indeed nice to not make it easier, and ideally even mitigate the fingerprinting you mention too.\r\nFor starters, we may have 2 caches: for regular (ipv4/v6) and non-regular (onion) networks, based on where the requester is located. I will put together a commit for that.\r\nIt could be further improved when we integrate [addrv2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki).\r\n\r\nThis would be another big improvement, now cross-node fingerprinting via GETADDR would take days or months, instead of just couple hours at most (a spy currently still have to ask a lot of nodes to map Tor nodes to regular nodes).",
