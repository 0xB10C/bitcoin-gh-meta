This was previously a hurdle for me in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16341#issuecomment-541330425, but maybe the problem is less severe here because it looks like the moves are happening in single commits, not in harder to reconcile add and remove commits.\r\n\r\nI would definitely appreciate it (can't speak for other reviewers) if this PR could be updated to use MOVEONLY commits (multiple small ones throughout or a big one at the beginning or end), but I'll give this a try and maybe the review will be easier than I'm expecting ð ",
