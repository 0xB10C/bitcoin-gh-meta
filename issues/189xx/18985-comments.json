In general I think that most functions that take either a const vector/prevector as input, or begin/end pointer, or a begin pointer + size, should be replaced with versions that just take in a Span.\r\n\r\nIt would be worthwhile to make `uint256` amendable to the range Span constructor. I think all you'd need is rename the data field to m_data, and then add a data() member function that does the same as begin().\r\n\r\nNit: uint256 is not a vector internally, but an array.",
