This removes [database loading with no logs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUFY8Zw0Bag) behavior implemented in #2558 1859aafef0a273e27e886646e36140cc5e375ee1, which hopefully should be unnecessary now that the wallet flushes very frequently.\r\n\r\nThis change should reduce chances for data loss and provide better error feedback if there's an unsuccessful attempt to load newer bdb logs with an older version of bdb. It also simplifies the wallet opening code.\r\n\r\nIt's possible this PR could cause new errors for users who weren't seeing errors before. If this happens we could add an easier to use manual recovery option, or implement a middle-ground automatic approach like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18870#discussion_r421698704 that will retry loading the wallet without log files as long as the log files came from a compatible bdb version.",
