So I am taking all those breadcrumbs and try to solve them. \r\n\r\nBut there are also other PRs of mine which have nothing to do with *good first* issues, so I really don't understand your question. Also, I don't see how I can help by **not reacting** to issues. \r\n\r\nA mediocre coder, like I am, can help best by solving minor, unimportant issues, in my opinion. Or by reviewing other people's PR, that I also do. Or by writing some smaller scripts for automating things, like with Bitcoin Signet.\r\n\r\nSo, all in all, little unimportant things that I do in my ~quarantine~ spare time. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't dare interacting with complex PRs, because such behavior would only cost valuable time of others. \r\n\r\nBut if this is an issue, no problem, there are other open source projects. \r\n\r\nCheers.",
