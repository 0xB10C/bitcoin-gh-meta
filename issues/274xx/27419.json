It is part of a series of patches splitting up the `util/system` files. Its preceding pull request is https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27254.\r\n\r\nThe pull request contains an extraction of ArgsManager related functions from util/system into their own common/ file.\r\n\r\nThe background of this commit is an ongoing effort to decouple the libbitcoinkernel library from the ArgsManager. The ArgsManager belongs into the common library, since the kernel library should not depend on it. See [doc/design/libraries.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/libraries.md) for more information on this rationale.\r\n",
