      "body" : "> The [BIP35](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0035.mediawiki) mempool P2P message can be used to share the txids in a node's mempool (motivation in BIP35). However it is no longer used (?), is bad for privacy, and we can simplify our P2P code by removing it.\r\n\r\nIt is still possible to guess mempool transactions using `getdata` by maintaining mempool with no restrictions. I dont think sharing mempool affects privacy particularly in this case as its behind `NetPermissionFlags::Mempool flag`. If privacy needs to be improved at mempool level it should be possible to make all transactions look similar until included in block except fee rate however that is out of scope for discussion here.\r\n\r\n> Subsequently the service was gated behind the NetPermissionFlags::Mempool flag, meaning that the original BIP identitifcation method is no longer sufficient to determine that a node will offer this service to you (the node operator must whitelist or otherwise elevate your net permissions before they will respond to it). Therefore I think that it is safe to remove without any change in protocol version.\r\n\r\nIt could still be helpful in testing. Since we have lot of inconsistencies in mempool policies recently for political reasons, I think we should keep this P2P message available at least for testing if `NetPermissionFlags::Mempool` flag cannot be removed.",
