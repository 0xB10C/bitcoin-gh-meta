As someone who has been invited and then abruptly disinvited from these without an explanation of why I do think the secrecy around these is convenient for those who want to push certain agendas or push certain individuals away from contributing to the project. But I think it needs to be a separate repo for organizing and discussing events rather than within this repo. There has to be a cut off for invites and directing that discussion to this repo doesn't seem ideal to me.",
