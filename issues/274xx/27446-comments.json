      "body" : "Configurable consensus parameters seems like a great way to make the network inconsistent in general (in particular, if you get the parameter wrong, you'll end up marking valid blocks invalid, with various consequences).\r\n\r\nWhat's the actual problem you're trying to solve here? Would it work to have the signet miner only generate blocks when the mempool has entries, and sit idle when it's empty, for instance? If you're trying to generate many blocks, then regtest is already better as it doesn't require a baseline proof of work, and simply having multiple regtest configs probably makes more sense.",
