Would it work to have the signet miner only generate blocks when the mempool has entries, and sit idle when it's empty, for instance? If you're trying to generate many blocks, then regtest is already better as it doesn't require a baseline proof of work, and simply having multiple regtest configs probably makes more sense.",

      "body" : "@ajtowns I don't think I am properly communicating my usecase correctly, but there are lots of concept acks from other developers that run signets as well. People want to use custom signets to have their own test networks, I don't see why we should disallow having custom block times. The main concern being people don't copy-paste the param into their conf and have troubles syncing, doesn't seem like a valid one given that they could do the same for `-signetchallenge`. I understand that it would cause a failure on block 1 vs block 2016, but normally those blocks are synced near instantly anyways. ",
