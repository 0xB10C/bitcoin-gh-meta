      "body" : "The \"rules\" field was introduced in #7935. It's not specified in [BIP 22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki) and [BIP 23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0023.mediawiki) which describe the expected behaviour of `getblocktemplate`. But then in [BIP 145](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0145.mediawiki) for segwit it's assumed to be there. I'm guessing something in between is documented in Stratum software?\r\n\r\nHere's [an example](https://bitbucket.org/ckolivas/ckpool/src/73f560cf3144f824823077c1b9e1663d89823ed7/src/bitcoin.c#lines-127:135) of how it's used by pool software. There's also some documentation through bug reports, e.g. #17946. My understanding is that `!` means that it's unsafe to mine without understanding the rule.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me how it is intented to be used, both as an argument and in the results. I'm also not sure how to interpret this wording in BIP 145:\r\n\r\n> The '!' rule prefix MUST be enabled on the \"segwit\" rule for templates including transactions with witness data.\r\n\r\nFor 6ab119d4c1c8cf3d9c0994c22d75d016a30cdd6a I have assumed that the consumer of this RPC may care about it, so we keep `!segwit` in the result. I've the read the above sentence as referring only to the result of the RPC. With this commit it doesn't matter if you set it or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @luke-jr",

You just don't have to specify it: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27433/commits/edd00677dbddd5b40fa3d2954e8cb04fcd8359f4#diff-ccc24453c13307f815879738d3bf00eec351417537fbf10dde1468180cacd2f1R821-R822\r\n\r\nWe do the same thing with `csv`.\r\n\r\n>> Two recent F2Pool blocks violated the sigops limit. Both by 3. I suspect they were not using getblocktemplate.\r\n\r\n> This PR is unlikely to have avoided it, then.\r\n\r\nI've since learned that they do use it, but with patches.\r\n\r\n> These are non-standard\r\n\r\nDo you mean BIP 22/23? It says:\r\n\r\n> getblocktemplate MUST return a JSON Object containing the following keys\r\n\r\nIt doesn't say there can't be extra fields, though I can see how people can screw up by not implementing from the spec, but rather from the JSON RPC. I can add a comment to the help pointing out they're not BIP 22/23 fields. Or hide them behind a debug option. It's useful to know these totals with resorting to `jq` magic.",
