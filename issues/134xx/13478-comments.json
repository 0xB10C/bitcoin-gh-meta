[QMacToolBar](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmactoolbar.html) might be handy for streamlining some Mac-specific code. There could also be some other calls that allow for code optimizations. Would it be worth the pain of adding it to the depends system, though? My gut says yes. The depends system, while a bit verbose, seems to make file adds pretty straightforward. I can take a swing at adding QtMacExtras to the depends system and see how awful it is, and then report back.",
