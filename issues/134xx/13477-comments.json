This approach is used in #16899. I don't think that's an ideal solution though; if there's forks you have to invalidate all of them, and if you don't shutdown p2p it starts disconnecting peers. So I'd prefer a more robust RPC call for this purpose like `rollbacktoheight`, which also requires fixing this precision issue. ",
