   "body" : "Currently CombineSignatures is used to create the final scriptSig or an input. However ProduceSignature is capable of doing this itself. Using both CombineSignatures and ProduceSignature results in code duplication which is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nTo move the scriptSig construction to ProduceSignatures, the SignatureData class contains two maps to hold pubkeys mapped to signatures, and script ids mapped to scripts. DataFromTransaction is extended to be able to extract signatures, their public keys, and scripts from existing ScriptSigs.\r\n\r\nA SigningProvider is used which contains a SignatureData object and another SigningProvider. With this SigningProvider, ProduceSignature can then retrieve scripts and pubkeys from a SignatureData if it is available, otherwise the nested SigningProvider is used.\r\n\r\nA SignatureCreator is used which contains a SignatureData object and behaves similarly to the above SigningProvider. This SignatureCreator either returns a signature present in the SignatureData object or creates a new signature if it can create one.\r\n\r\nUsing the new SigningProvider and SignatureCreator, ProduceSignature replicates all of CombineSignature's functionality and thus CombineSignature and CombineMultisig have been removed.\r\n\r\nThe tests have also been updated to use the new combining methodology.",
