Some best guesses could be implemented, but I fear that adding this into `-onlynet` may also lead to less predictable behaviour.\n\nWhen you have a manually run Tor instance, configured with a Bitcoin hidden service, you generally run it on localhost. Bitcoin Core can be configured to only accept incoming connections from localhost, but that's independent from the Tor configuration - it does not actually at any point in time know that these connections are Tor ones. In theory, someome can also run their Tor instance elsewhere (on a local network, for example).",
