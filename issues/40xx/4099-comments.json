The kernel has a maximum argument length (as you say), and Qt has a maximum line length (both for sanity reasons).\r\n\r\nYou can work around this with a Python script that calls the RPC. For example, adapt `contrib/bitrpc/bitrpc.py`. I've done so succesfully in the past for very large transactions.\r\n(or you may could forego `decoderawtransaction` completely and use the transaction decoding in python-bitcoinlib)\r\n\r\nClosing this as I don't see this as an issue with Bitcoin Core itself, and it can be easily worked around.\r\n",
