Bits are not, they denote storage capacity.\r\n\r\nI wish you would be a bit more open for discussion instead of concluding this.  The logic is actually not as simple as you make it out to be.\r\nFirst of all; the idea that SI units are well rooted is not reflected by the real world. Try to order a 500gram piece of meat in a shop in the USA. Brits are also not that well versed in the metric system. Let alone the SI extension to that. Its not the job of bitcoin to educate about SI, instead we have to make due with what people understand.\r\n\r\n> I'm fine with using 'bits' colloquially but this is up to the community to decide not developers. Colloquial names are never formally used.\r\n\r\nI understand that you, as a software developer, make the connection of \"bits\" to bytes/storage etc.  This is unfortunate, but luckaly the vast majority of intended users won't be wired that way. :) Hope you can see the distinction and joke about it, as this is for sure not meant to insult in any way.  The point is that \"bits\" is a play on \"bitcoin\".  Only computer techies will make a connection with bytes, the rest of the people (see the reddit thead) will most likely see the intended connection which is that \"bits\" the small version of \"Bitcoin\".\r\n\r\n> This also introduce a duplicate unit which is pointless... at most it would be an alias for micro-BTC.\r\nI agree, I would personally remove uBtc.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping this request doesn't have to be closed so fast, after all a HUGE amount of end users have been stating that the uBtc version is just too hard to use (again, see reddit links). Please don't ignore them by stating they are stupid and should learn SI.",
