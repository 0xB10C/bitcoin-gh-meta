This doesn't prevent nodes from lying, but it does constrain them to more realistic values.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** hmm... I must be doing something wrong; given the average timespan of 10 minutes there would be 277866 blocks, but there are 296293. In a pure Poisson process a deviation this large would be *extremely* unlikely. My naive idea above would get every peer's claim rejected. But it must still be possible to put some realistic bound.\r\n",
