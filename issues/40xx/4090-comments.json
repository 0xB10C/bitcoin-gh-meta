By directly returning the coins to mining miners are incentivized to refuse to mine near-expiration transactions in the hopes that they won't make it in in-time and will expireÃ¢ÂÂ \"near\" doesn't have a bright line distinction, it's just whatever they can get away with. As a result I don't think this proposal would be very advisable in any crypto-currency, not just Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nOne problem with the \"market will just price the loss in\" is that the market currently can't distinguish loss from just inactivity, so that creates growing uncertainty about the supply. This could be answered by the simpler approach of just making long unmoved coins unmovable, which has less incentive problemsÃ¢ÂÂ though it's still probably completely Bitcoin incompatible.",

You have an OP_IF and in the branch you have a timelock verify and a different set of keys to sign for the coin. Though its a bit inefficient to always have to sign including that data.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative for 'inheritance keys' is to simply always create timelocked spends of your coins whenever you receive them. I've thought this might be an interesting wallet feature, to automatically create timelocked spends of your coin so that if you don't spend them by a certain time they'll go to selected friends/family/charities. (Friends/family having an advantage that perhaps they can give them back to you if you're still around and merely lost your wallet).\r\n",
