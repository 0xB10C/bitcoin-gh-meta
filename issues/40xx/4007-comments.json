You can look into the importaddress rpc call, its possible to import a script or address there. We automatically detect, whether a script or an address is given by the user, same can be done here.\r\n\r\nReturn values, same as for gettxout, but as an array of those, because an address can have multiple outputs and the user can pass multiple addresses. In addition every element in the array should have:\r\n- txid\r\n- vout\r\n\r\nPreferably information about the block the output is in:\r\n- blockhash\r\n- blockheight\r\n- blockdate\r\n\r\nWe store the height in CCoins, with that you can just retrieve the blockinformation from the blockindex\r\nin chainActive.\r\n",
