   "body" : "Similar to #26892, this PR simplies the functional tests p2p_tx_download.py and p2p_eviction.py by using MiniWallet in order to avoid manual low-level tx creation. For the latter, rather than mining 100 blocks manually, the pre-mined chain of the test framework is used.\r\n\r\nThese instances were found via `$ git grep signrawtransactionwithkey ./test/functional`. AFAICT, there are no other instances where MiniWallet could replace tx creation trivially.",
