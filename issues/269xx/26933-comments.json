Can't we have the situation where 1000s of txs get evicted anyway, simply by accepting a high fee rate 400kb tx that then causes a large number of small min feerate txs (with no unconfirmed ancestors/descendants) to be evicted due to hitting the mempool limit? (At least evicting ~350 otherwise unrelated txs that way seems possible -- simple 1-in 1-out txs seem to contribute ~1150 bytes to mempool usage each for me, so 350 of them should use about 402kB)\r\n\r\n> (what if the 0-fee ancestor is bumped by something else?)\r\n\r\nWe essentially have to do the work to see if the ancestors are bumped by something else anyway, whether they're 0-fee or not (when we evict the conflicted descendant; its ancestors' descendant fee rates get updated). When we get to TrimToSize, we just look at the already calculated descendant score, and evict the low ones. But the logic there doesn't change if the lowest fee rate is 0 or 1 sat/vb?\r\n\r\n> 06:30 < sdaftuar> i think my concern is that the mempool shouldn't have things in it that would never get mined, eg because they're below minrelay fee (which we compare against in the mining code iirc)\r\n\r\nWouldn't it make more sense to address that directly, ie by having TrimToSize trim txs whose descendant score is below min relay fee, even if the mempool isn't full? Then txs who lose their CPFP child will get trimmed essentially immediately, no matter how they got in, and no matter why the parent might have been removed?\r\n\r\nI don't mind the concept here (which I summarise as \"only allow txs below min relay fee via some scheme that deliberately limits the complexity\"), but it seems more like a \"here's another special case\" instead of \"here's a simple rule that's easy for everyone to think about\".",

My concern was whether it would be problematic to have many such transactions to trim, hence these changes beforehand. If we instead decide that we're ok with this, I'm happy to drop these.\r\n\r\nSomewhat relevant, I'd also wonder if we should add a `TrimToSize()` at the end of reorgs. Same reason, so we don't add below-minrelayfee from disconnected blocks. And same concern, that it could make the process slower.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure I see why this is a problem?

But since package cpfp would be a new way of permitting such transactions, I'd rather lean towards being conservative?",

If we instead decide that we're ok with this, I'm happy to drop these.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that we shouldn't be concerned about using up too much CPU in such cases; just that if we are, there are other analogous cases we should be concerned about too...\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar\r\n\r\n> This is insufficient for preventing transactions that will never be mined from staying in the mempool, because 'TrimToSize' would leave transactions in the mempool if a parent and multiple children appear to have enough fee for the combined package size, even though no single child has an ancestor fee rate above the min relay fee (eg a \"children-pay-for-parents scenario).\r\n\r\nRight, but that's a reflection of us using ancestor score for mining, but descendant score for mempool removal... So presumably we'd get similar behaviour even if min relay fee is 0 -- ie, if we have a parent/children relationship like that where the parent has a high descendant score but the children have low ancestor scores, then they'll remain in the mempool while we evict txs with a fee rate in between those values due to the mempool being full, even if it turns out those txs would be mined while the child txs would not. (Though the key value there is what people are using for `-blockmintxfee` not the min relay fee per se...)\r\n\r\nReplacing descendant score is a big, possibly impossible, project though, so Concept ACK on working around it in this way in the meantime. I think it would be better to be much clearer on exactly what this is achieving though.",

I think it would be better to be much clearer on exactly what this is achieving though.\r\n\r\nAgreed. I've rewritten the description to focus on the fact that we can end up with descendant packages of transactions that would never be mined but still get to hang out in the mempool. I've also written a test to demonstrate this [here](https://github.com/glozow/bitcoin/commits/26933-motivation), on top of the \"evict everything below min relay feerate in TrimToSize()\" commit (to show it doesn't fix this issue), and added a description of this test to the OP so it would be in the commit log. I could adapt the test for this PR, but most of it would not be executed when the changes are in place, so I'm not sure how meaningful it would be.",
