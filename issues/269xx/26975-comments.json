      "body" : "Thanks for linking the issues, i have not seen those before.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> The fuzz framework was designed to be agnostic of the underlying fuzz engine. Does libprotobuf require libfuzzer?\r\n\r\nNot necessarily, I think LPM should be compatible with any fuzzing engine that has support for something similar to libFuzzer's custom mutator API (e.g. afl++: https://aflplus.plus/docs/custom_mutators/, they even mention LPM in these docs). Writing a wrapper to make that work should be easy enough. Out of the box however, there is only support for libFuzzer.\r\n\r\n> How does this integrate into the fuzzing farms (Oss-Fuzz, and the ones based on fuzz/test_runner.py --generate)?\r\n\r\nI think technically, there should be no reason why this shouldn't just work(tm) on any of the fuzzing farms. As long as libFuzzer is used by the farm, it doesn't need to know about anything protobuf/LPM specific. There are multiple projects on oss-fuzz that make use of LPM (e.g. llvm, envoy). So integration should be quite straight forward, like our other fuzz targets.\r\n\r\n> we'd likely have to duplicate all fuzzing infra (qa-assets, coverage, CPU farms, ...)?\r\n\r\nI don't think so, the corpora could still live in qa-assets and creating coverage reports should still be the same. If the proto fuzzers end up being in separate binaries then all we need to do is tell our fuzzing infra about those binaries (that's at least my understanding, you know more about our infra). I am certainly happy to help make this work with our current infra, if we decide to go this route.\r\n\r\n> How does this deal with fuzzing input that are impossible to represent in protbuf? For example I could imagine a target that uses CallOneOf and conditionally deserializes inside one of its branches to not be representable, at least trivially?\r\n\r\nThe proto fuzzers are intended to only receive well formed protobufs as inputs (afaict it ignores any inputs that don't match the input grammar) and the custom mutator makes sure of that. You wouldn't use `CallOneOf` the way you are describing (at least if I am understanding what you mean correctly). You can use `FuzzedDataProvider` with in a proto fuzz target by having raw bytes in the grammar definition (see the version handshake example, it still uses the fuzzed sock).\r\n\r\n> How does this deal where the target code and the proto format are mismatching?\r\n\r\nI don't understand the question, could you give an example?\r\n\r\n> What you expect from devs: Should they write a proto fuzz test or a \"normal\" one, or both?\r\n\r\nDon't have a solid framework on this yet but some thoughts.\r\n\r\n- It can definitely make sense to do both in some cases. A non-bitcoin example would be fuzzing a json parser, just taking the raw bytes from the fuzzer and interpreting that as a json string has value (i.e malformed garbage shouldn't cause any bugs), however that rarely produces valid (complex) json objects which is where LPM could come in (creating a grammar for json as a protobuf definition is quite easy see: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:testing/libfuzzer/proto/json.proto).\r\n- For simple targets where non-complex and few inputs are required, input splitting with `FuzzedDataProvider` is probably preferable, however if we have other targets that consume the same/similar inputs it could make sense to use LPM instead (to make sharing of inputs easier).\r\n- Any target that requires complex inputs (e.g. blocks, transactions, sequences of p2p messages, etc.) is likely to be better suited for LPM. That being said, I do think that targets like `process_message(s)` still make sense even if we have LPM targets for the same code, as they are really simple.\r\n- Any target where we might want to evolve the input grammar could be a good usecase for LPM, so that previous inputs aren't invalidated.\r\n\r\n> Do you have real world data on two identical targets, where the protbuf one finds a bug earlier?\r\n\r\nNot yet, gonna try to code up an example.",
