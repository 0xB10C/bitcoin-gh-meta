Does libprotobuf require libfuzzer?\r\n* How does this integrate into the fuzzing farms (Oss-Fuzz, and the ones based on fuzz/test_runner.py --generate)? we'd likely have to duplicate all fuzzing infra (qa-assets, coverage, CPU farms, ...)?\r\n* How does this deal with fuzzing input that are impossible to represent in protbuf? For example I could imagine a target that uses CallOneOf and conditionally deserializes inside one of its branches to not be representable, at least trivially?\r\n* How does this deal where the target code and the proto format are mismatching?\r\n* What you expect from devs: Should they write a proto fuzz test or a \"normal\" one, or both?\r\n* Do you have real world data on two identical targets, where the protbuf one finds a bug earlier?",
