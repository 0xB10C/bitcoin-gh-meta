   "body" : "@JeremyRubin found a performance regression introduced by b3b3c2a5623d5c942d2b3565cc2d833c65105555 which causes us to make copies of every transaction we connect to tip a while back, but no one had gotten around to fixing it yet. By switching to using shared_ptrs for blocks in several places we not only fix the performance regression but open up the possibility of switching GetMainSignals() callbacks to background threads much more easily.\n",
