      "body" : "Hi @gtsui welcome to the project!\r\nPlease tell me if you have any problems with this or other related PRs and I will try to help you\r\nEverything seems perfectly correct with this PR.\r\n\r\nutACK (stands for \"untested ACK\", see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review )\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I have to add is that there was some recent talk about replacing the checkpoints as a mechanism for guessing the verification progress. If that change were made, then LoadBlockIndexDB() and LoadBlockIndex() could take only a const Consensus::Params& instead of the full const CChainParams&.\r\nI hope that's not a blocker for this, but if it is, it should be easy for you to rebase and adapt it that change is merged.",
