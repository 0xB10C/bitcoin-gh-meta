      "body" : "One issue which needs to be address in my code above is that I read from mapInfo via [ ]. This violates the very sensible coding style guide requirement that [ ] is never used for map reads. I could use an assert as is used in other code in addrman:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nassert(mapInfo.count(nId) == 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead I'd prefer to create a private method for accessing mapInfo elements by nId similar to CAddrMan::Find. As this is a refactor task which touches code outside of test-before-evict, I want to break it out into a separate commit to be included in this pull request.",
