Most mining/pool software at the moment has only hard-coded support for paying to a pubkey hash. Obviously it would be nice give them the ability to support the other formats, but as-is, it can be tough (and potentially very expensive) to simulate mining for a few days on mainnet.\r\n\r\n(Though you could make the argument that a preference should be submitted to in gbt via coinbasetxn, which would include a serialized scriptPubKey or txout with the template, but let's ignore that for the sake of the example).\r\n\r\nThis would allow those changes to be made/tested safely, without having to worry about differences in chaings wrt activation status.\r\n\r\nAs for changing the consensus.powLimit, I was hoping to avoid mixing app logic in at the chain level.",
