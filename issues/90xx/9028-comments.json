      "body" : "I looked into this, creating a test driver for UniValue that works with the test suite, and fixing a few issues that this uncovered. There were no test cases that caused crashes, but there was:\r\n\r\n* A test case that showed UniValue improperly accepting a non-minimal utf8 sequence (`C0 AF`)\r\n* A test case that showed UniValue returning a partial parsing of a json input with an embedded nul byte (`'\\0'`)\r\n* Some test cases that failed because of missing features in UniValue: utf16 decoding, support for reading plain number and string values not embedded in objects or arrays.\r\n\r\nI created a PR at https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/pull/1 with a few commits fixing the various issues. Not sending the PR upstream for now, because it's not clear which of the changes might be desirable to keep permanently.\r\n\r\n",
