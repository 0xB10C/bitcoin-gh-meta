See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8704#issuecomment-256321542 . There's zero overhead in simply accepting both without warnings or complaints.\r\n\r\nMaybe add a `GetVerbosityLevel` function that accepts UniValue and returns int. It would map bool `false` to 0, bool `true` to 1, as well as accepts integers (which are returned as-is). This could be shared between various RPC calls that have a verbosity level (yay consistency).",

There are several other RPCs which take a bool for a more verbose output: getrawmempool, getmempoolancestors, getmempooldescendants, getblockheader, getblock, gettxout (where the option is includemempool). As far as I can tell, getrawtransaction is the *only* call which currently takes a num. It's less disruptive to change one RPC to use a bool than change all the others to use nums.",
