Still much lower than my real balance.\r\n\r\nThere is more weirdness, which I discovered now.  `bitcoin-cli listunspent 0` with the newer version lists a lot of my spent outputs, some of them multiple times, with 0 confirmations and wrong (nonexisting) txid.  I can identify the spent outputs via the address and amount.  The scriptPubKey may be correct as well.  It lists all my real unspent outputs as well, with correct txid and number of confirmations.  The sum of the unspent values from real transactions equals what getbalance reports without the argument, i.e. the real balance.  The older version will only list the real unspent outputs, not any of the bogus ones.",
