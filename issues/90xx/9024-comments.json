This is confusing for users.\r\n\r\nI've had a look through the RPCs, and as far as I can tell, getrawtransaction is the only call which takes an int for verbose.\r\n\r\nI've opened https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9025 to change getrawtransaction to take a bool for verbose. It will still take a num for backward compatibility, but will issue a warning to the user that using a num is deprecated.",
