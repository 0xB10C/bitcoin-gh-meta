      "body" : "NAK. This undoes an intentional design decision. It is not acceptable to have the network topology suddenly change all at once time when segwit activates, due to the risk of creating partitioning (we can't fetch blocks from non-witness peers once segwit is active: so we need to be sure that we're connecting to witness peers before it activates).  The approach used in the codebase was intended to only have nodes behavior change when they are upgraded, so that the change would phase in gradually in the network (and if it caused problems users could revert to escape it).\r\n",
