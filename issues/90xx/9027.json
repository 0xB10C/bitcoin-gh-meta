   "body" : "#9014 brought to light in issue introduced in #7946 - when we do a reorg, we now keep the full contents of each block we connect in memory until the reorg is complete. Luckily, #9014 makes this a bit eaiser to fix - dont keep more than a few blocks around in shared_ptrs, just re-read them from disk after the reorg is complete when you need to call signalers. This may be complicated due to pruning, but it should be doable.",
