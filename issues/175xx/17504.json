Is anyone running x86-32 VMs for other purposes than testing software on that architecture? Even with that, how much testing are these binaries getting?\r\n\r\n(to be clear, I'm not arguing to *remove support for 32-bit*, just to stop building and providing binaries for it. I also think ARM is a different matter.)",
