   "body" : "Currently, in case of block disconnection, if any conflicting transaction was inside, we don't undo conflicts on wallet transactions, i.e they stay in state `CONFLICTED` instead of being mark again as `UNCONFIRMED`. This lack may falsify balance computation and block the user to re-submit tx to mempool. \r\n\r\nIf conflicted transaction was at a latter time confirmed, status is already updated accordingly, nothing change.\r\n\r\nThis change implements conflict undo and also clean some bits of `MarkConflicted` which is renamed `UpdatedConflicts` to cover both unconfirmed -> conflicted and conflicted -> unconfirmed cases. Lambda is used, but I'm open if people have other approach on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
