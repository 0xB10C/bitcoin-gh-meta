It was introduced back in the day because of symbol collisions between dynamically-linked Qt and the built-in statically built OpenSSL which could have scary implications.\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been the case for agesâever since Qt5 and before, we've statically linked Qtâand we don't even use OpenSSL anymore. I don't think a binary that exports symbols can usually cause problems (exporting excessive numbers of symbols would be an indication that something is going wrong in the link, but besides that). \r\n\r\nThe check is already being skipped for some architectures.",

I suspect it's another unexpected by-effect of #17270, because it passes with 1baf7d1819317e4f4aeeaba2f9d72057e63b1fea.\r\n\r\nEdit: no, it's not #17270, I don't have the issue with 0bb37e437e9cb4a29476edc9fa42f3e03c8bd797",
