It was introduced back in the day because of symbol collisions between dynamically-linked Qt and the built-in statically built OpenSSL which could have scary implications.\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been the case for agesâever since Qt5 and before, we've statically linked Qtâand we don't even use OpenSSL anymore. I don't think a binary that exports symbols can usually cause problems (exporting excessive numbers of symbols would be an indication that something is going wrong in the link, but besides that). \r\n\r\nThe check is already being skipped for some architectures.",
