Coin selection will be Brand and Bound for exact matches, and if that fails, then both Knapsack and SRD will run. The \"better\" result of those two algorithms is the one that will be chosen.\r\n\r\n\"Better\" is defined as having lower fees. If the fees are the same, then the one that chooses more inputs (so consolidates more). If that is also the same,  Knapsack is then used (i.e. Knapsack is preferred).\r\n\r\nRequires #17331",
