So are we assuming that builds for people using `master` and system libraries are also currently failing when using `--enable-werror`? It would be good to get some examples.\r\n\r\nThe problem this PR is \"fixing\", which is unclear from the description, is that 15382 introduces a dependency on Boost Process, and in Boost 1.70.0 (used in depends) there is an unused variable in the process module `boost/process/detail/posix/wait_group.hpp:140:13: error: unused variable 'ret_sig'`, which is supposedly fixed in Boost 1.71.0.\r\n\r\nI just want to be clear why this is being reverted, because when it was introduced in #17486, depends and system libs seemed to be building fine under `--enable-werror` (and seemingly still are). However now we're going to revert part of the change because a PR with 1 (outdated) ACK, that introduces a new Boost dependency, is failing to build under `--enable-werror`.\r\n\r\n ",
