However, sometimes there are intermittent failures, so we can't enforce it.\r\n\r\nAlso, in this particular case the error came from a package that was upgraded below our feet. This has trade-offs:\r\n\r\n* Either we not fetch the latest package and risk that the documentation (list of packages) goes stale\r\n* or we check that the documentation is still up to date and risk that appveyor returns red\r\n\r\nPick one, but not both ;)",
