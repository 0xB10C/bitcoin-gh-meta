That being said for a project like Bitcoin Core where catching problems far outweighs rapid development cycles it does seem justified.\r\n\r\nAs I'm writing I have just succeeded in porting the appveyor job to Github Actions and have run a successful build (minus tests). It looks like build time and maintenance overhead will be approximately the same as appveyor but the [usage limits](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-github-actions#usage-limits) do look a lot more appealing. If it does support 20 concurrent CI jobs that could significantly improve the situation for Bitcoin Core PR writers waiting for the build results.",
