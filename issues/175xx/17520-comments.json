      "body" : "#14920 goes beyond this PR by applying `-isystem` to all dependencies, not just `depends/`. But actually that makes sense: I just caught the same error without depends on one of my machines that still had Boost 1.70.\r\n\r\nIt puts this behind `--enable-isystem` and a warning: `Including /usr/include with -isystem is known to cause problems, e.g. breaking include_next due to, the directive changing inclusion order.`. This PR doesn't do that, but that's because it's incomplete.\r\n\r\n@theuni expressed some concern about it: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14920#issuecomment-452505849\r\n> I'm really not a fan of disabling warnings for 3rd party headers, but I'm not completely opposed. I'm more afraid that this will be one of those changes that causes lots of subtle future grief due to edge-cases in libtool, automake, ccache, non-glibc builds, dependency generation (gcc's \"-M*\" options), etc.\r\n\r\n>  I gave a few examples above about possible weird edge cases. Qt demonstrates another with include_next. Non-system toolchains and sysroots containing -I are two others.\r\n\r\n> I'm really uneasy about this due to the diversity of compilation environments. But other than the things I pointed out, it looks ok to me on paper.\r\n\r\n> On second thought, as long as it's off by default, concept ACK.\r\n\r\nThat probably means reverting the `Werror` part of #17486  and  re-applying it after #14920, but moving it under the `use_isystem\" = \"xyes\"` check.",
