   "body" : "Final preparation step in #10082 before introducing the TestNode class.\r\n\r\nThis builds on top of #10555. The first 5 commits are from that PR. Without those commits, the travis build times out.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the stop/start functions from utils.py into BitcoinTestFramework. It also moves stateful functions/variables from utils.py into BitcoinTestFramework (coverage variables, bitcoind_processes dict, mocktime functions). It also does some general tidyup of test_framework.py and utils.py.\r\n\r\nThis touches a few individual test cases, but those changes are very minor. The important changes are in util.py and test_framework.py. The final commit is a code move only.",
