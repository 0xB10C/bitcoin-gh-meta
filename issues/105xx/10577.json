I wanted to suggest a normative protocol\r\n change to use the trick we use here, but to find an explanation\r\n of it I had to dig up the PR on github.  After I posted about it\r\n several other developers commented that it was very interesting\r\n and they were unaware of it.\r\n\r\nI think ideally the code should be self documenting and help\r\n educate other contributors about non-obvious techniques that\r\n we use.  So I've written a description of the technique with\r\n citations for future reference.",
