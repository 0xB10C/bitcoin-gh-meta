And it's a question if it's worth it.\r\n\r\nGot it. Thanks for the comments. Should I close the issue now?",

It could still be possible now I think.\r\n\r\nSince you have to recover pubkey from the signature right now, you can go to pubkeyhash and scripthash, given you somehow know the script format (in this case, p2sh-p2wpkh).\r\n\r\nThe signer would sign the message with his private key; the verifier would try that the pubkey in the signature generates the given address through p2sh, which would mean the signature is valid.\r\n\r\nThe only problem I can think of is that you are then proving both the ownership of the p2pkh and the p2s-p2wpkh addresses, but it doesn't really matter.",

Important for proof of holdings.\r\n\r\nI do not expect that blockchain.info will necessarily let you lookup the base address for a SegWit or Bech32 address? I can understand that it may be necessary for this use to possibly provide an additional field for the encoded resultant address (can be automatically populated) which if used should and different to the signing address (using GUI terminology) should be verified to be a correct resultant against the signing address or equal to it and, appended to the message before signing. The signed message will then be increased by two new lines and one address. (hopefully in the format `bitcoin:{address}`) This will need a mechanism to prevent fraud. - Or, can blockchain.info be updated to work if it currently won't?\r\n\r\n# Does blockchain.info show balances for addresses that are in cold storage?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n>... is there any way for me in another country to confirm that what my colleague views is actually accurate and correct?\r\n\r\nSince they use Bitcoin Core, yes, there is a way to verify that they hold the addresses that they claim. Have them sign a message with each address that they claim to have the holdings on, using Bitcoin Core you can verify that they indeed have those addresses and check them on blockchain.info to find the current balance.\r\n\r\nOnly works in Bitcoin Core currently for addresses starting with a '1' (not Segwit addresses starting with a '3' and not Bech32 addresses starting with 'bc1' - the developers are aware of this and I will remind them shortly.)\r\n\r\nIn Bitcoin Core, your transaction opposite goes to File -> Sign Message and signs any message with one of the holding addresses. Copy the message, address and signature and send to you via probably plain text format email is the easiest. Repeat for each additional address holding the balance of BTC that they are offering to sell.\r\n\r\nIn Bitcoin Core, you go to File -> Verify Message and key the details provided EXACTLY - spaces, new lines and all characters must be an EXACT match. Click on verify and voilÃÂ .\r\n\r\nI prefer the form of signed message as follows (don't key the top and bottom bar rows for the message, just the contents and you can check this yourself, the bottom row is the signature). I like to key the address used for verifying as a part of the message but that is not strictly necessary:\r\n\r\n    ------------------------------\r\n    Something that I want to sign.\r\n    \r\n    bitcoin:1PMUf9aaQ41M4bgVbCAPVwAeuKvj8CwxJg\r\n    ------------------------------\r\n    Signture:\r\n    IGaXlQNRHHM6ferJ+Ocr3cN9dRJhIWxo+n9PGwgg1uPdOLVYIeCuaccEzDygVgYPJMXqmQeSaLaZVoG6FMHPJkg=\r\n\r\nThis contains all of the compact information necessary to verify the message.\r\n\r\nExample of verified message:  \r\n![verified message][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zv1xq.png ",
