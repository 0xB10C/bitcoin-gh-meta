See the original description:\r\n\r\n> Unfortunately, pruning.py still isn't able to run on Travis. It appears that disk access is very slow for in the Travis environment, and this test still times out/fails. Unfortunately, it's not possible to run this test without very heavy disk access - the whole point of pruning is to remove block files when disk usage goes over a certain threshold.\r\n\r\nIf you can think of a cunning way to get this to run on Travis, that'd be great. I haven't been able to come up with anything.",
