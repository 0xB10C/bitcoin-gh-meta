      "body" : "Some further backstory here: libevent's release process is **slow**. Maintenance is in no means standing still, many improvements have been made in the 2009-now timeframe. However, these have not ended up in the stable versions (2.0.x). Even some bugfixes have not, I had to push to get a basic IPv6 http fix in at some point (which had been in 2.1.x for a long time).\r\n\r\nBranch 2.1.x had been in alpha for years, and has entered beta 2015-01-05 with 2.1.5. Despite not officially being called stable yet it seems rock-stable overall.\r\n\r\nAs you can see with #8722 and  #7759 I've been starting to bump against the restrictions of 2.0.x. So I'm in favor for this.",
