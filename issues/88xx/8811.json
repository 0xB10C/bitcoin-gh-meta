   "body" : "The [JSON-RPC specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) allows either passing parameters as an Array, for by-position arguments, or as an Object, for by-name arguments. Currently Bitcoin Core only supports by-position arguments.\n\nThis pull request makes the (minimal) changes to support by-name arguments, but preserves full backwards compatibility. APIs using by-name arguments are easier to extend - as arguments can be left out - and easier to use - no need to guess which argument goes where.\n\nThis is especially nice in languages such as Python, which have native support for named arguments. Examples from the test:\n\n``` python\nh = node.help(command='getinfo')\nh = node.getblockhash(index=0)\nh = node.getblock(hash=h)\n```\n- In this implementation named arguments are mapped to positions by a per-call structure, provided in the RPC command table. In the future calls could process the parameter object themselves, but this provides nice automatic interoperability with both worlds.\n- Missing arguments will be replaced by null (\"holes\"), except if at the end, then the argument is left out completely.\n- It is not possible to specify **both** named and positional arguments like in Python. JSON-RPC doesn't allow for this, and I think it would be only confusing anyhow.\n- An error (`RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER`) will be return if an unknown named argument is specified.\n\nCurrently no calls have support for \"holes\" between arguments, but this should be implemented later on a per-call basis. These should be replaced with default values.\n### TODO\n- `bitcoin-cli` should grow support for providing named arguments. One idea for doing this would be e.g.\n\n```\nbitcoin-cli getblock --hash=\"0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef\"\n```\n\n(thanks @jonasschnelli  for this idea, he used it in the Digital Bitbox control utility)\n- Calls in `mining`, `net`, `rawtransaction` `wallet` still need argument names filled in. I'll do this if reaction to this is positive.\n- Same for the debug console. Syntax to be determined there. Not necessarily in this pull, my focus here is the core implementation.\n### Review notes\n\nThe first commit is https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue/pull/27 (upstream). Second commit is #8810\n",
