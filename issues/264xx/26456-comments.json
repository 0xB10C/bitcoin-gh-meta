We need to come to a consensus on whether we will release 24.0 with the option, and once it's out the door, we can go back to arguing about whether to have it in the long term.",

There won't be clear consensus on this for 25.0 either or 26.0 or 27.0.\r\n\r\nAgreed. But unlike Taproot and other soft forks, we at least have a clear consensus on a perfectly valid way for the wider community to express their option: the `mempoolfullrbf` flag.\r\n\r\nMy advice to maintainers is simple: if you release the flag, all the discussion about whether or not full-rbf should happen can happen outside of GitHub.",

      "body" : "Concept ACK for two main reasons:\r\n\r\n1. As a matter of general policy, I believe it is better to release on time (or slightly late) without a new feature than to either delay the release for the new feature or release a new feature that has outstanding concerns by a significant number of well-informed good actors.\r\n\r\n2. As I argued extensively on [#26287][], I believe we should provide one release cycle worth of advanced warning in the release notes when we are contemplating a change that may significantly adversely affect downstream users.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI was trying to think of previous occasions where the project removed code during the RC process due to controversy, so here's a quick summary with references of what I think is the closest match to our current circumstances.\r\n\r\n*A brief history of making the BIP61 P2P `reject` message an option, disabling it by default, and then removing it across the 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, and 0.20 releases:*\r\n\r\n- 2018-05-01: [#13134][] opened to add an `enablebip61` configuration option and default it to true (the existing behavior).  Merged 22 days later.  Released in 0.17 five months later.\r\n\r\n- 2018-08-24: [#14054][] opened to default `enablebip61` to false (a change in default behavior).  Merged 27 days later.\r\n\r\n- 2019-03-01: version 0.18 with branched off master (per [#14438][])\r\n\r\n- 2019-03-06: an [announcement](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-March/016701.html) of the planned disablement was posted to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list.  Several people protest the change.\r\n\r\n- 2019-03-14: [#15602][] opened directly against the 0.18 branch to revert `enablebip61` back to true but adding a release note saying, \"BIP 61 reject messages are now deprecated.  [...] BIP 61 messages will be disabled by default in a future version, before being removed entirely.\"  Merged the same day and released in 0.18 six weeks later.\r\n\r\n- 2019-11-24: version 0.19 released with `enablebip61=0`\r\n\r\n- 2019-10-18 (date out of order): [#15347][] merged into master (after 0.19 was branched off) to fully remove BIP61 `reject` message support, including the `enablebip61` option.\r\n\r\nIn comparing that situation to the current one, I imagine those in favor of `mempoolfullrbf` will note that `enablebip61` was included in 0.17 without issue.  It's not clear to me whether that was because its preservation of existing behavior was unopposed or because nobody who would've opposed it knew about the change before its release.\r\n\r\nWhat I appreciate about the previous situation is that the project at that time met the surprise of downstream users to a non-emergency change in an RC with a quick reversion but a clear statement of future intent---an intent which was ultimately realized.  The total delay this added to the plan of removing BIP61 was just six months.\r\n\r\nWe're not currently in a position where I think any of us can predict the future state of full-rbf within Bitcoin Core, but I think we can take this opportunity to release 24.0 quickly without a controversial change and with communication to downstream users that there may be rbf-related changes in the next major release (and that the consequences of those potential changes may manifest even earlier due to activity outside of the Bitcoin Core project).\r\n\r\n[#26287]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26287\r\n[#13134]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13134\r\n[#14054]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14054\r\n[#14438]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14438\r\n[#15602]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15602\r\n[#15347]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15347",

      "body" : "> outstanding concerns by a significant number of well-informed good actors\r\n\r\n@harding: You need to be clearer here on who you consider well informed good actors. (e.g. I consider Suhas a well informed good actor with an unfortunately very last minute intervention but I also consider Peter, Luke, Andrew as well informed good actors who are all in favor of releasing 24.0 with this option) There are a small minority commenting who will be against enabling this option or any additional RBF mempool policy support (e.g. in v3 transaction relay) in any future version: 25.0, 26.0, 27.0 etc. So a valid concern a significant number of commenters have is that either it is never released because of this small minority or worse some strange compromise is proposed with that small minority (and I've observed this tendency with you a number of times now) which ends up being inferior to the initial simpler solution.",

      "body" : "@luke-jr \r\n\r\n> BTW, bitcoincore.org has for years linked to a schedule to switch to full RBF mid-2016\r\n\r\nYes, it links to a schedule that was obsolete months before opt-in RBF was proposed and which says, \"Prior to the activation deadline, supporting nodes and miners will support first-seen-safe(1) replace-by-fee (FSS-RBF) mempool behavior\", which clearly hasn't happened in Bitcoin Core yet.[1]\r\n\r\n> I'm sure there have been other mentions of this as a long-term plan. I don't think it's correct to imply there was no announcements until 24 rc1.\r\n\r\nThere were certainly plenty of announcements of individual developers or teams of developers working towards the goal of full-rbf, but it seems like some people are checking the release notes for these types of announcements---which is the most logical place to find them, especially since the project does almost no other communication as a unified team---and so we should be using that mechanism to communicate this upcoming change.\r\n\r\n@michaelfolkson \r\n\r\n> [...] some strange compromise is proposed ([by] you a number of times now) which ends up being inferior to the initial simpler solution.\r\n\r\nOoh, juicy ad hominem!  How many times exactly?  Can you please rank them in order of impact?  I want to frame the list and put it on my brag wall.\r\n\r\n[1] For those not around circa 2015, here's a quick summary of what FSS-RBF meant (and what full-rbf meant back then): https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2022/10/19/#fn:full-rbf",
