There are a lot of things in 24.0 that I would like to see released, and several things with more urgency too, IMO. We need to come to a consensus on whether we will release 24.0 with the option, and once it's out the door, we can go back to arguing about whether to have it in the long term.",

We should not be setting a precedent that we're so concerned about zeroconf that merely giving an *option* to users is unacceptably dangerous.\r\n\r\nTime is a concern here: John Carvallo has stated that his company is [\"working on tools to make 0conf acceptance easier/safer,  but some devs would rather try and break a Bitcoin use case to protect their niche designs.\"](https://twitter.com/BitcoinErrorLog/status/1588129893996548097). He of course has been one of the most vocal in opposition to having this option. We do not want to be in a position where by delaying the release of this option, we have even more political pressure in the future.",
