This allows services to cleanly terminate connections before going down, instead of losing ongoing connections leaving the other side in an undefined state.\r\n\r\nPresumably `After=network-online.target` service is afforded the same graceful shutdown time before the network is brought down?\r\n\r\nAnyway, speeding up system boot time certainly seems worthwhile, and Bitcoin Core can handle being offline just fine, so i think I'd agree that this change was a net positive. My own systemd file for Bitcoind has always just contained a simple `After=network.target` and it's worked for a few years without issue.",
