Right now, any target using `ConsumeNetAddr` would have a hard time uncovering bugs that require valid onion addresses as input.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `ConsumeNetAddr` produce valid onion addresses by using the 32 bytes given by the fuzzer as the pubkey for the onion address and forming a valid address according to the torv3 spec.",
