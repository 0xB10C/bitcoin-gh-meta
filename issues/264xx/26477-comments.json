IMO the priority should be addressing that and then moving on to less immediate issues, like what the aesthetically preferable fix should be.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that probably some more substantial change is needed to avoid similar issues in the future, but this change is probably the simplest thing that could be done to unbreak master, and it introduces test coverage.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of forward progress (and not having a broken master!), I would recommend that either we merge this as-is or you propose an alternative in short order, because I have other stuff to do in the immediate term besides rethink integer parsing across the codebase, and I'd like to e.g. be able to rebase assumeutxo on master and test it without crashing.",
