      "body" : "Concept ACK. Admittedly, I haven't been following this issue very closely, but wow, that mailing list post was very persuasive. The analogy between the `-mempoolfullrbf` flag and a hypothetical `-disable_v3_transaction_enforcement` flag to me was the most compelling part, as well as the framing:\r\n\r\n> Relay has only ever been a best-efforts concept, where we carve out a small subset of the entire transaction universe for which we try to optimize propagation.\r\n\r\nAdding options for different nodes to see different subsets of the transaction universe seems something we would really want to avoid unless the options provide very compelling benefits. And given limitations of `-mempoolfullrbf` described in footnote 3, the benefits it provides seem scant compared to the cost and complexity having to design for multiple mempool policies on the same network going forward.",
