      "body" : "I think this is a nice idea.  However, I spent some time looking into the details, and I'm leaning slightly towards Concept NACK for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- By using undo data, we would only be able to calculate and display fees for blocks that are on the active chain; a user might find this unintuitive\r\n\r\n- The documentation for `getblock` says the transactions are \"in the format of the getrawtransaction RPC\":\r\n\r\n\t- If we don't update `getrawtransaction` then the API might become more confusing\r\n\t- If we do update `getrawtransaction`, the performance penalty could be high, since the cost of loading undo data is no longer amortized across many transactions in a block\r\n\r\nWhat do you all think?  Is it still worth the benefit of showing fees for blocks on the active chain?",
