I would try to use `-reindex` first but I think that won't be enough and you need to delete the blk*.dat file that the block in question is in and then use `-reindex`. \r\n\r\nEdit: Sorry, I realized I am not sure if this is a feature request or if you just needed help. The title sounds like a feature request but the description only talks about the problem. Let me know if you are looking for a different solution than I described and how that should look like when implemented.",
