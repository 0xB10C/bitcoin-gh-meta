   "body" : "Add unit test calling CreateWalletFromFile, which isn't currently called from other unit tests, with some basic checks to make sure it rescans and registers for notifications correctly.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change was to try to write a test that would fail without the early `handleNotifications` call in ef8c6ca60767cac589d98ca57ee33179608ccda8 from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426, but succeed with it:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ef8c6ca60767cac589d98ca57ee33179608ccda8/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L3978-L3986\r\n\r\nHowever, writing a full test for the race condition that call prevents isn't possible without the locking changes from #16426. So this PR just adds as much test coverage as is possible now.\r\n\r\nThis new test is also useful for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15719, since it detects the stale notifications.transactionAddedToMempool notifications that PR eliminates.",
