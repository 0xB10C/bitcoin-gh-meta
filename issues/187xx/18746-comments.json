This change removes that inconsistency and adds the invariant that no coin can be spent and FRESH in any cache.\r\n\r\nThere's unlikely to be any noticeable performance change here. After all, it's very rare that we'll fetch a spent coin from a parent cache (which I'd argue is all the more reason to remove the special case code for that).\r\n\r\nI think this is an improvement to clarity, but you may be right that it's not worth changing.",
