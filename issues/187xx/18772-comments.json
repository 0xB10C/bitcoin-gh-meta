Any thoughts on what would be a reasonable approach here?\r\n\r\n- Also update `getrawtransaction` (and the documentation) to include a fee if possible (this might be slow since the cost of loading undo data is no longer amortized over many transactions in a block)\r\n- Update the `getblock` documentation to mention that unlike `getrawtransaction`, it might also include fees\r\n- Leave the documentation alone and let the unfortunate user figure out the semantics themselves :)",
