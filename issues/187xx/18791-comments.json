      "body" : "I'm not sure this change is a good idea. I think it made sense to add shared_ptr support to the validation interface in #18338 because it only required 4 new lines of code in validationinterface.cpp, and because without that support it would have been more complicated to unload wallets safely, given the wallet was already using shared_ptr to share CWallet references between `vpwallet` vector, active RPC calls, and the GUI.\r\n\r\nBut I don't think the non-shared validation interface should be removed just because a shared_ptr interface is available. Or if this change is a good idea, we should figure out exactly what the goal is. I don't think when we first switched to shared_ptr in the wallet we intended it to spread virally to unrelated classes like `BaseIndex` and `PeerLogicValidation`",
