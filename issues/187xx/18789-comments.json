I tend to agree with Luke here in that for a basic user it's still too much clutter and could confuse them into thinking they've sent when they have not so that might be a place to put that option if you can figure it out. Maybe the button could also automagically show up if and only if it's a no privkey wallet(or instructs the user to set the option?).",
