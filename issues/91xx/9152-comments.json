One could import \"old\" private keys into a new HD wallet for example.\r\n\r\nPossible extension: `sweepseed` could be an extended version of that, moving all funds form a HD seed to a new one, generating large lookup-windows on different chainpathes. It could also be UTXO set only not requiring a -rescan.",
