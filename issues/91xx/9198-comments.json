      "body" : "Looks like the first is coming from deserializing the addressbook using a CDataStream, which clears with zero_after_free_allocator, which uses the openssl lock callbacks.\r\n\r\nI think the second comes from the usage of GetRandInt inside of CAddrman::Select().\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how dangerous this is, but we should drop the need for openssl_cleanse in CDataStream, and instead let it take a templated param for its container, which is by default just a plain vector. Things that really need cleaning could request zero_after_free_allocator specifically.\r\n\r\nDone here: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/671c724716abdd69b9d253a01f8fec67a37ab7d7, though without taking a thorough look and adding cleansing back where it's actually necessary.",
