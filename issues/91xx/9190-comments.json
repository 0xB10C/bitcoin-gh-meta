The GUI apparently has quite some leaks, some of which we probably can't help. None extremely serious - these are mostly objects allocated only once, although the thread leak is a bit scary for other reasons: there really shouldn't be a RPC executor thread before `AppIinit()` nor after `Shutdown()`. So it's a safety fix too.\r\n\r\n@fanquake to answer your IRC question this was with Qt 5.5.1, the system library on Ubuntu 1604.",
