      "body" : ":) @jonasschnelli actually, the progress shows as less than it really is, so it shouldn't be causing unneccessary wait. i.e. if the last block downloaded is 0.989920 progress, then the rescan will finish at 0.989920, i.e. you won't need to wait for it to get to 1.000000.\r\n\r\nThe risk of the number being misleading is that you'll go away to make a sandwich thinking it is going to take longer than it does need, and will come back later than need be.\r\n\r\nVery easy to fix, we just need to tweak the number to factor in that the 0.989920 (or whatever the progress of the last downloaded block is) is actually 1.000000, and that the number of the first block to rescan is 0.000000.",
