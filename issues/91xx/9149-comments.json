The place for this is probably the bitcoin-dev mailing list.\r\n\r\nThe current time-slot has been chosen after asking and arranging with every interested participant finding the best slot that could work for most interested participants. Sure, we can (and probably should) re-evaluate a better, different time-slot every here and there (maybe once every year).\r\nBut my feeling tells me, that changing the timeslot will make things difficult for some.\r\n\r\nThe public IRC meeting is hold in #bitcoin-core-dev (just because it's most convenient there).\r\n\r\nIMO there are already various forums to discuss stuff (ex. https://bitcointalk.org).",
