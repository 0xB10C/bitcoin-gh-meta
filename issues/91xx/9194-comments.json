I haven't looked but I assume there are a lot of places in the code where this issue (of not knowing whether the consumer wants witnesses or not) would come up?\r\n\r\nI suppose we could try to do something like what @sipa suggests: a command line flag indicating the serialization to use (with/without witness) for all downstream consumers; it just seems tedious to get right.  Might it not be better to just add a python script to contrib that takes a witness-serialized tx and returns a serialization without witness?  I guess that would still require downstream library changes, so maybe that doesn't help.",

This exercise also may come in handy when it comes to switching over wallet functionality to segwit by default, which I'm imagining will be a similar mechanism. I also think that any time we have to change serialization in the future, we can ratchet whatever argument we have, and deprecate older versions if we can't trivially support them.",
