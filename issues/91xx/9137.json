   "body" : "(This is an implementation of the change requested in #8497. Code is in place but it's untested and will need new tests.)\r\n\r\nAllow importprivkey, importaddress, and importpubkey RPCs to be called with\r\nrescan=True option on nodes with pruned blockchains (run with -prune option).\r\nInstead of returning an error, the RPCs will now look for transactions spending\r\nto the key in the UTXO database, and display them in the wallet.\r\n\r\nBecause the UTXO database doesn't store full transaction information (it\r\ndiscards TxIns) this change introduces a new \"fIncomplete\" CWalletTx member to\r\ndistinguish these from normal wallet transactions.\r\n\r\nThis change makes the -prune mode usable with wallets that need to import keys\r\nafter the initial sync.\r\n\r\nFixes #8497.",
