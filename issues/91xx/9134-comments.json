Or wait for someone to tell us what exact environment they use and when they tried (maybe it worked with some older version of gitian).\r\nIt's on my \"to do\" wishlist to contribute to the docs, but there were too many problems that I couldn't resolve so I haven't submitted documentation bugs/corrections yet.",
