      "body" : "On the db_dump/db_load error, I think this would have to be caused by an accidental `\\fc` -> `_` replacement in a part of the dump that wasn't an address name. I don't know how many replacements you had to make, but if it was not too many, I might try visually inspecting a diff of the dump file before and after the replacements, or maybe just starting with a few replacements and then adding more so you can identify which one(s) cause the warning. Also if there aren't too many transactions, it might be easier to use the wallet gui interface to change the address labels rather than work with dump/load.\r\n\r\nOn the underlying bug which caused latin1 to be stored in the database rather than utf8, it looks like it was fixed in 2011 with the `setCodecForCStrings` call added here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/3f0816e3d926e0ea78ac7b6cd43efe62355885c8#diff-8c9d79ba40bf702f01685008550ac100R116\r\n\r\nOne improvement that might be a good idea to make now would be to have `UniValue::setStr` validate that strings passed to it are utf8. There actually already is utf8 validation code in the UniValue library (used during parsing), but it just isn't called right now by `UniValue::setStr`. Changing this could ensure that bitcoin never outputs invalid JSON, and make bugs like this one easier to track down and fix.",
