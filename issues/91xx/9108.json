Sending now to get early feedback on the code changes.)\r\n\r\nWhen importing a watch-only address over importmulti with a specific timestamp,\r\nthe wallet's nTimeFirstKey is currently set to 1. After this change, the\r\nprovided timestamp will be used and stored as metadata associated with\r\nwatch-only key. This can improve wallet performance because it can avoid the\r\nneed to scan the entire blockchain for watch only addresses when timestamps are\r\nprovided.",
