I opted to make it build by default with `--enable-tests` because if it is a specific option, no one will ever bother to enable it (which means it doesn't get built and runs out of date), and we don't want too many `--enable-X` anyway.\r\n\r\nThis needs documentation on how to use it w/ AFL, but not necessarily in this pull.\r\n",
