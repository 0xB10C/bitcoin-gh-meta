However, there still appears to be little/no documentation about nested commands (or other peculiarities not applicable to the command line RPC).\r\n\r\nThere is a comment block in [rpcconsole.cpp#L134](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6157e8ce3937af3f46d3e7dd922d19d6dc272145/src/qt/rpcconsole.cpp#L134), that gives a quick overview, and I'd be happy to flush that out (either as a doc or as a debug console only help command). I just wanted to make sure this was still needed before starting.",
