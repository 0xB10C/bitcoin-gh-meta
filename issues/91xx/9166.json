Some old TXs in that `wallet.dat` contain comments with non-ASCII chars encoded as **latin1**.\r\n\r\nIn this case it's the German Umlaut **ÃÂ¼** encoded as `0xFC` (latin1) instead of `0xC3BC` (UTF8).\r\n\r\n`bitcoind` passes the comment in it's JSON response to `bitcoin-cli` without transformation, so the parser in `bitcoin-cli` complains about the latin1 representation of that character.\r\n\r\nJSON must to be used with UTF8 encoding.\r\n\r\ntcpdump confirms that the problem only occurs with TXs with non-utf8 special chars in their comments.\r\n\r\nSkipping the TXs with the problematic comments works fine:\r\n\r\n> % bitcoin-cli listtransactions '*' 1 2\r\n> (...)\r\n\r\n### Does dumping wallet.dat with `db_dump`, modifying the dump file and `db_load` work as a workaround?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nI used `db_dump -p` to dump the `wallet.dat`, then edited the comments and replaced the special chars with ascii-chars in the dump file. The modified dump file was fed to `db_load` and the resulting `wallet.dat` file put in datadir.\r\n\r\nNext start of `bitcoind` resulted in errors like these:\r\n\r\n> 2016-11-15 17:29:55 init message: Loading wallet...\r\n> Warning: Error reading wallet.dat! All keys read correctly,\r\n> but transaction data or address book entries might be missing or incorrect.\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to handle this?",
