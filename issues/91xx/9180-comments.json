      "body" : "Yes! This is indeed what I was referring to. Thanks!\r\n\r\nI'd rather the flag be a boolean (\"Skip validation of burried blocks\"), as is right now it's trivial to (accidentally) set it to 0 and not check anything, which isn't a configuration we should operate on; other people may also have opinions there.   One thing that will likely be requested is a unidirectional latch, similar to how IsInitialBlockDownload works, so that in a reorg the signatures will still be validated. (Rationale: a reorg of burred blocks should never happen, so we don't care if its slow. Having it ends any concern \"zomg what if all the hashpower goes rogue for a month!\"-- no need to debate how unlikely an attack is when we can instead make it so that it would only impact installing new nodes).\r\n\r\nI'll give your patch more review soon.",

      "body" : "Cool!\r\n\r\nAbout the flag: I'm flexible. I kind of like the ability to choose a time/depth/amount of work beyond just buried validation being allowed or not. It does make it easier for people to be extra conservative and increase it. Although, any non-boolean usage would be only for super-power-users and it might not be prudent to use values much lower than the default. I could make the minimum acceptable value be two weeks (nPowTargetTimespan) instead of zero. Less than one re-target interval kinda seems risky when considering possible sudden increases in rate of work. The default of being equivalent to 30 days worth of current work is longer than two re-targets, so I figured that would mitigate some risk. I guess we'd need to provide some kind of guidance on usage if it's not a boolean flag too.\r\n\r\nAbout the latch: Your rationale seems to make sense, but I don't see right now how a block would have to be re-validated again. A theoretical ginormous re-org could re-org the buried block off the active branch, or layer different work on top. But, a re-org could not make the buried block be covered by less total work. I'll dig into this more in the morning.",
