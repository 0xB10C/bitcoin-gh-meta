      "body" : "Yes! This is indeed what I was referring to. Thanks!\r\n\r\nI'd rather the flag be a boolean (\"Skip validation of burried blocks\"), as is right now it's trivial to (accidentally) set it to 0 and not check anything, which isn't a configuration we should operate on; other people may also have opinions there.   One thing that will likely be requested is a unidirectional latch, similar to how IsInitialBlockDownload works, so that in a reorg the signatures will still be validated. (Rationale: a reorg of burred blocks should never happen, so we don't care if its slow. Having it ends any concern \"zomg what if all the hashpower goes rogue for a month!\"-- no need to debate how unlikely an attack is when we can instead make it so that it would only impact installing new nodes).\r\n\r\nI'll give your patch more review soon.",
