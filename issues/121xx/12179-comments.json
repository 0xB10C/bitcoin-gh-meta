The rpc help for abandontransaction says that \"It has no effect on transactions which are already conflicted\". So the only thing that should happen on abandoning rbfed txes is that a trash icon is shown in the gui.\r\n\r\n> I wanted to double the fee, but \"increase transaction fee\" didn't give me any way to say how much to increase it by, so I had to click it maybe 20 times to get to the fee I wanted.\r\n \r\nYou might want to use the bumpfee rpc, which should support that, IIRC. Pull requests welcome, though.\r\n\r\n>  I was able to select all the conflicted transactions at once, and right-click the group. When I selected \"abandon transaction\" on the group, it only deleted one transaction from the display, not all of them. Why let me select multiple transactions if the right-click menu only operates on one of them anyway?\r\n\r\nPull request welcome",
