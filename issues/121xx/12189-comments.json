      "body" : "@Sjors I agree that it's a good idea to do 2 different PRs for these changes. Adding the ability to specify custom fees in sat/vbyte is a decent chunk of work because of the way the Custom Fee text field reuses the `BitcoinAmountField` widget which is used in a couple different places in the UI (like when selecting an amount of BTC to send in a transaction, and to receive). \r\n\r\nI think the best approach for the custom fee section would be to not use `BitcoinAmountField` but to  create a new widget specifically for the custom fee input that would both:\r\n\r\n1. Allow inputting the fee as sat/vbyte\r\n2. When not inputting the fee as sat/vbyte, display (either in the UI or as a tooltip) the resulting sat/vbyte.\r\n\r\nWhen this second PR happens, the Recommended section should also probably either show the sat/vbyte instead of BTC/kb, or show both.\r\n\r\nI agree with your Nit about the format of the fee per size label, and will be updating this PR to reflect the change in a few minutes.",
