      "body" : "I had to grep the diff to figure out what @chiguireitor was referring to. I assume it is the comment about MAX_STACK_SIZE limiting the number of elements that can be proven from a Merkle tree at once. That number is actually an error, as it should be 997, not 9997 as MAX_STACK_SIZE is a constant limit of 1,000 elements and 3 of those elements are the count parameter, the root hash, and the proof. It's worth noting that a separate limit, the 520 byte push limitation, prevents pushing a proof for a fully expanded Merkle tree of more than about 1380 elements anyway, so even if the MAX_STACK_SIZE limit were avoided you'd hit another one soon enough.\r\n\r\nHowever I think there is some confusion on @chiguireitor's part. Why would you want to prove 1,000+ items from a tree at once? This is the maximum number of elements that you can prove at one time, NOT the maximum number of elements that can be in a tree, for which there is no practical limit. The 520 byte push limitation prevents you from proving a hash more than 16 levels deep in a tree, but MERKLEBRANCHVERIFY calls can be chained allowing for verification of extremely deep trees, much larger than could be practically constructed. A single chained validation allows for trees consisting of billions of elements, that would take hours to construct on a reasonably powerful CPU.",
