   "body" : "Some scenarios where it might be useful to run tests against earlier releases:\r\n\r\n* creating a wallet with #11403's segwit implementation, copying it to an older node and making sure the user didn't lose any funds  \r\n* future consensus changes\r\n* P2P changes (e.g. to make sure we don't accidentally ban old nodes)\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncontrib/devtools/previous_release.sh -f v0.15.1\r\ntest/functional/downgrade.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving to build these old versions on developer machines is probably unacceptably slow, so tests that involve older versions probably shouldn't run by default. Travis can cache earlier releases, so it should be able to run these tests with little performance impact.\r\n\r\nI only tried version v0.15.1, which involved a small patch due to #11389. I don't know how hard it would be to keep supporting earlier releases with similar patches in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat's a good place to store these patches?\r\n\r\nI'll split this PR later if useful.",
