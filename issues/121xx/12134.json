Travis can cache earlier releases, so it should be able to run these tests with little performance impact.\r\n\r\nI only tried version v0.16.0 ~v0.15.1 and v0.14.2, which involved a small patch due to #11389~. I don't know how hard it would be to keep supporting earlier releases with similar patches in the future.",
