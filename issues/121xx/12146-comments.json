While we shouldn't make a habit of recognizing outputs to mutations of addresses we've given out, if someone sends you funds to a SegWit address, and you wish to refuse it, you're welcome to not honor the payment. Instead, we should be moving towards longer-term goals like splitting the HD chain across address types and recognizing payment only to addresses we've given out in a non-backup-breaking way.",
