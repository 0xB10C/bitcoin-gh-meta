As @MarcoFalke points out, the \"correct\" solution is to import all the transactions the wallet needs to know the current state of things. How are you exporting transactions to give to the pruned node? If you're using another Core daemon it may be useful to consider adding an RPC which, when provided with a set of output scripts in the wallet, provides all the transactions it knows how to export to make it easier to get all the available transactions.",
