Bitcoind running ~ 15 minutes (Start up time + one new block)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6394033/34962556-1142edb2-fa3c-11e7-91be-e7e49bc42f14.png)\r\n\r\nThese are the top most active functions (Exclusive: Not including nested called functions)\r\n\r\nIt's evident that the max_open_files parameter makes a difference. Finding the correct value for this is another story but I think we could save some CPU cycles by considering a number > 64 at least.\r\n\r\nLeveldb's paranoid flag is turned on also meaning that we do a CRC checksum on opening tables (files). 7% of collected samples include this. The number falls off as we require less file opens.\r\n\r\nI hope someone can comment on this research and any maybe run similar numbers on a Linux machine.",
