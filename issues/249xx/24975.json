   "body" : "In the current mempool benchmarks, the coins were not being deleted from `available_coins` since `Available` rather than `Available&` was used. Also the lack of the reference meant that `coin.vin_left++` only incremented the copy's variable rather than the one in the vector. The removal condition previously compared the coin's `vin.size()` to `vin_left`, when it should have been using `vout.size()`. I changed the `MempoolCheck` bench to instead use `min_ancestors` of 1 rather than 5 as otherwise an underflow could occur when calling `coin.ref->vout.size() - coin.vin_left`. This previously did not occur since `vin_left` was always 0 since a copy of the coin was used. Using 1 vs 5 shouldn't give too much of a difference since the test can still generate more than 1 (or 5) ancestors.",
