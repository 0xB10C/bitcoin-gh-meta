That implies that the types are trivially destructible, thus the checks for `is_trivially_destructible` are not needed.\r\n\r\nAlso, in several places an iterator is dereferenced and the address is used, I believe this is undefined behavior when used on past-the-end iterators. This replaces these usages with access to the iterator's `ptr` member instead.",
