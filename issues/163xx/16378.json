   "body" : "`walletcreatefundedpsbt` has some interesting features that `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` don't have:\r\n* manual coin selection\r\n* manual `feeRate`\r\n* outputting a PSBT\r\n* creating a transaction without broadcasting\r\n\r\nAt the same time `walletcreatefundedpsbt` can't broadcast a transaction, which is inconvenient for simple use cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new `send` RPC method which creates a PSBT, signs it if possible and broadcasts it by default. If it can't sign all inputs, it outputs a PSBT. If `broadcast` is set to `false` it will return the transaction in both PSBT and hex format.\r\n\r\nBecause it uses a PSBT internally, it will much easier to add hardware wallet support to this method (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14912#issuecomment-510520757). In fact, this PR is loosely based on the `signersend` method I implemented in #15876.\r\n\r\nI switched the `inputs` and `outputs` arguments to facilitate the simplest use case with automatic coin selection:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbitcoin-cli send '{\"bc1....\": 0.001}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI made `locktime` just another option.\r\n\r\nThis paves the way for deprecating `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany` though there's no rush. The only missing feature afaik (see TODO) is adding labels to destination addresses. Additionally, `sendtoaddress` doesn't require JSON formatting of the address and destination, which arguably confuses new users. I could mimic that behavior as well.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] depends on #16377 (`[rpc] don't automatically append inputs in walletcreatefundedpsbt`)\r\n- [ ] best merged after #15911 (`Use wallet RBF default for walletcreatefundedpsbt`); this PR currently has the same bug\r\n- [ ] write tests\r\n- [ ] add `bip32derivs` back (as just another option)\r\n- [ ] implement `comment` field to achieve feature parity with `sendtoaddress` and `sendmany`\r\n- [ ] reuse code, especially help text, between `send` and `createfundedpsbt` to prevent future divergence",
