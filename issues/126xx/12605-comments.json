There's a lot of weird stuff in the legacy code that I don't think would pass code review today. After #10637 is approved, I think it's a good idea to do an overall cleanup/refactor of what exists at the same time as (or maybe in a PR just prior to) the removal of the exact match algorithm, with the intent of making it easier to get later changes merged.",
