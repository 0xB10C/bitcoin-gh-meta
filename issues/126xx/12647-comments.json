It looks like the existing leak scenarios are for fatal errors, but more RAII pointer types is good in my opinion.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of weird that you're putting this in a `std::unique_ptr` and then later on giving the raw pointer to a `WalletRescanReserver()`; for that pattern I would have expected to see a `std::shared_ptr`. That being said `WalletRescanReserver()` looks like kind of a mess in general (e.g. it uses a mutex to access `fScanningWallet` in `reserve()`, but not in `isReserved()`).\r\n\r\nutACK 9378d89",
