Adding `printtoconsole=1` to `bitcoin.conf` has the side effect that it completely suppresses logging to `debug.log`, which is annoying if sometimes you run bitcoin as a daemon and sometimes you run it in foreground mode.\r\n\r\nWe should probably change the `LogPrintf()` logic to log to both if both flags are set. But even in that case if you add `printtoconsole=1` to your bitcoin.conf file you'll get behavior where bitcoind would log all messages twice, with the stdout one going to `/dev/null`. This is harmless but inefficient.",

I added it as a \"secret\" option (meaning it's suppressed by default from `-help` output). You can also use `-debuglogfile=/dev/null` and `-debuglogfile=0` to disable logging. There are also Python test cases for all three methods. So I believe everyone got what they asked for :-D\r\n\r\nInterestingly, before this change `-debuglogfile=/dev/null` did **not** work, because `FileTruncate()` does not check that its argument is a regular file. This is yet-another Unix compatibility thing that I would like Bitcoin to support better! I believe this means that master will fail if you try to log to e.g. a named pipe created with `mkfifo(1)`, which is not common but still an unfortunate bug.\r\n\r\nOne question I have about this change: I was originally going to update the `-debuglogfile` help string but realized it would require it to be re-translated. Since developers are probably the only ones who want this option it might just make sense to have a one line changelog note about the change? I'm not sure what the protocol is for this.",
