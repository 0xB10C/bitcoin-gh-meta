      "body" : "On Linux `SCHED_BATCH` just prevents batch tasks from pre-empting normal tasks (i.e. normal tasks will run until their timeslice expires, or another normal tasks pre-empts them). When picking the next task to run the scheduler considers `SCHED_OTHER` (i.e. normal) and `SCHED_BATCH` tasks equally. This is why setting `SCHED_BATCH` tasks are only \"mildly disfavored\", because they'll still be considered to run using the normal metrics whenever the scheduler ticks (usually 100Hz or 1000Hz).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like Windows `THREAD_MODE_BACKGROUND_BEGIN` is [much more extreme](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43051261/why-does-thread-mode-background-begin-cause-my-code-to-run-20x-slower-than-threa). It looks like maybe the Windows equivalent is `THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL` but I do not know a lot about Windows.\r\n\r\nI don't know as much about the script verification threads. If we are going to set `SCHED_BATCH` for loadblk then it makes sense to me to set the script verification threads to `SCHED_BATCH` as well, at least until the loadblk thread completes. You can freely switch back from `SCHED_BATCH` to `SCHED_OTHER` so it would be possible to only run them in the batch mode while reindexing is happening, or we could just always have them set at batch priority.",
