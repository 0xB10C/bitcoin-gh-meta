   "body" : "On Transifex, Serbian language has two options:\r\n\r\n- Serbian Latin (sr@lat)\r\n- Serbian (sr) - which is Cyrillic but the label is unclear.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are plenty of overlaps of people writing Latin in Cyrillic and vice-versa. I am wiling to clean this up, but are there ways to either give a clearer label instead of (sr) for Cyrillic as it is obviously causing plenty of confusion among translators. \r\n\r\nBoth are the official styles of writing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, is there a way to get in touch with coordinators as they appear to be inactive? I do not see much progress. I am willing to work on this, but I'd need help from coordinators or have a coordinator access in order to work on it properly. I'm doing same work for bitcoin.org \r\nI am user [nedved](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/nedved/) on Transifex.\r\nThank you.",
