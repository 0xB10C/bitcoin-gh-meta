      "body" : "Curious what the use case is for this. Makes sense, but I can't think of why a pruned node would actually want this.\r\n\r\nThat being said... I am uncomfortably excited by the idea of removing an index based on `CDiskBlockPos`. I have enough experience with logical/physical indexing schemes in my pre-Bitcoin life to feel strongly about this. Besides the pruning use case you just gave, using physical offsets now is trading a very small efficiency gain for a lot of pain in the future if we want to change the data format.\r\n\r\nNormally the way this is implemented in a real database is via a \"secondary index\", which is not supported by LevelDB natively. If you imagine we stored blocks in MySQL or Postgres, you might have an auto-increment \"block id\" that maps to the full block hash, and then the txindex would map to block ids instead of the full hash. This is similar to your idea of using block height. Dealing with actual block heights sounds kind of confusing because you'd either need to deal with reorgs, or have confusing code that ignores reorgs (the node is missing data afterall) that would make things more convoluted.\r\n\r\nSince this is a brainstorming issue, something else that's been on my mind is whether it's possible to support more exotic index types (e.g. address indexes) in a sane way with the existing LevelDB code. In general, having more flexible indexing code would be a big benefit. There's a lot of duplication in the existing index logic we have that could be cleaned up and made more efficient.",

      "body" : "> Use case: a secure and decentralised way to access and decompose a transaction by it's ID on low resource hardware. Usually, if you want a decentralised self-validated txindex, you need 100GB+ of free spaces.\r\n\r\nI think this use-case is significantly more simply implemented with gettxoutproof/verifytxoutproof/decoderawtransaction. If you've already discovered from somewhere that you want a transaction, that somewhere can just as easily provide a txoutproof, and verifytxoutproof will already (AFAIR) tell you if the proof corresponds to a transaction on your (fully-validated) chain.",
