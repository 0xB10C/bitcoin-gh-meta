   "body" : "If there was an error loading the wallet after creating the instance, the instance would leak. This uses RAII to ensure the instance is cleaned up in that case. Issue found during review of #11687.\r\n\r\nWould like commentary on moving `RegisterValidationInterface` further down. I believe this is safe to do because the only code path that invokes `CreateWalletFromFile` is in `AppInitMain` before the `CConnman` is started.",
