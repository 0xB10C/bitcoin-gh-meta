   "body" : "This adds configure options for `-fsanitize=address`, `-fsanitize=thread`, and `-fsanitize=undefined` which are all disabled by default. These flags are useful for developers who wish to do additional safety checking. Note that some of these are mutually incompatible, and these may have a large performance overhead. There's a kind of confusing error case here if you set these and don't actually have the libraries available (the third party lib checks will fail), but the logic to handle that correctly is a little tricky because it differs between GCC and Clang. I can add it though if there's interest.\r\n\r\nThe argument for making these configure options (instead of just having people pass these options using `CXXFLAGS=...`) is that when `CXXFLAGS` is set by the user it disables a lot of other flags (see the `CXXFLAGS_overridden` check), so being able to set these using configure options is a little easier (and similar to how the existing `--enable-debug` option works).",
