But notice that in this case the warnings do not come from system headers or from headers that are outside of our control. They come from files within the bitcoin codebase: `configure.ac`, `build-aux/m4/ax_boost_chrono.m4` and `build-aux/m4/ax_boost_unit_test_framework.m4`.\r\n\r\nIf we are more relaxed during configure-time checks (e.g. no -Werror), then there is a chance that we pronounce a library which produces warnings as \"available\" and later if we build with stricter flags (e.g. -Werror), then the build itself would choke when it tries to use that library.\r\n\r\n> Have you tried using --enable-werror rather than adding directly to *FLAGS? That option is there to solve exactly this issue, as well as to whitelist no-false-positive warnings.\r\n\r\nYes, it only uses the stricter flags when compiling files from `src/` and not during the configure checks. I was upset that it only adds `-Werror=vla -Werror=thread-safety-analysis`.\r\n\r\n> We could probably stand to be more aggressive with those.\r\n\r\nYes. I would suggest to use just `-Werror` instead of `-Werror=vla -Werror=thread-safety-analysis`. That could make it fail in environments where it previously succeeded. I guess it would need more extensive testing - at least with all supported compilers, right?\r\n\r\nShould I adjust this pull request to do that - use just `-Werror`?\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, I think the changes to `configure.ac` are good and can/should go in. The changes to `build-aux/` have the issue of modifying imported source from boost and the risk of those changes being wiped away in case of re-import of a newer version (but there is a project to ditch boost altogether).\r\n\r\nHow to proceed?",
