      "body" : "@sipa Packets larger than 512 bytes are supported with the introduction of EDNS (see RFC 6891 dated April 2013; earlier RFCs that reference EDNS0 that may also be of interest) that uses an unsigned 16-bit integer to specify RDLEN (Record Data Length).  Also, while UDP is a MUST for DNS services, TCP is a SHOULD, and both of these transport layer protocols can, for the most part, support EDNS's larger packet size options.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the natural limit that is more well-known has effectively been extended (IP packet fragmentation and reassembly make it possible to venture beyond the MSU, which is commonly set to 1,500 bytes).",
