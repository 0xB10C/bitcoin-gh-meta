   "body" : "This makes console printing smarter when `-printtoconsole` is not explicitly set. The new behavior:\r\n * The series of newline separators that we send to the log when starting up are only sent to `debug.log`, never to stdout.\r\n * Logging to stdout is set up by default when the process is not a daemon and stdout appears to be a TTY.\r\n\r\nThis code makes use of `isatty()` which is defined in `unistd.h`. MingW ships a comptability `unistd.h` header so this should work on Windows. One thing I found strange when writing this is that I had initially expected to just be able to do the `isatty()` check and not look at the `-daemon` option, since stdout will not be a TTY when the process daemonizes itself. It turns out that logging initialization happens before daemonization, which is why I need to check that flag explicitly.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is that I almost always run bitcoind in foreground mode when I'm debugging or doing development work, and the new behavior makes checking log statements a lot easier in that situation. I think these semantics are also more similar to the default behavior of many other Unix programs.",
