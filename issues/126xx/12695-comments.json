It seems like if we want to have the best symbols for both we need some additional logic here.\r\n\r\nGCC:\r\n * Recommends you use -Og\r\n * Says that -g3 includes macro definitions in the debug symbols (the only difference from -g2, which is the default when using -g)\r\n\r\nClang:\r\n * \"-O0 Means \"no optimization\": this level compiles the fastest and generates the most debuggable code\"\r\n * \"Note that Clang debug information works best at -O0.\"\r\n * \"-Og Like -O1. In future versions, this option might disable different optimizations in order to improve debuggability.\"\r\n * Option -g3 is not documented in the man page.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like \"-g -Og\" works on both compilers, but for Clang \"-g -O0\" is actually better.\r\n\r\nThe `$GCC` and `$GXX` variables are set if the compiler defines `__GNUC__`, which clang does. So those variables should never be used. To actually test for Clang you should check if `__clang__` or `__llvm__` are defined.\r\n",

I don't think that's the case here. The code also builds fine with msvc, and I'd hope that icc works as well.\r\n\r\nSo checks like this really don't make much sense because they're basically just hard-coded:\r\n```bash\r\nif test $CLANG -eq 1; then\r\n  AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG([-O0],[[DEBUG_CXXFLAGS=\"$DEBUG_CXXFLAGS -O0\"]],,[[$CXXFLAG_WERROR]])\r\n...\r\n```\r\nLet's try instead to come up with some universal checks that can be applied.\r\n\r\nA few more little things gleaned from glancing at the gcc/clang code:\r\n- gcc's -Og is also basically -O1, with a few things explicitly removed:\r\n   ```\r\n       { OPT_LEVELS_1_PLUS_NOT_DEBUG, OPT_fbranch_count_reg, NULL, 1 },\r\n       { OPT_LEVELS_1_PLUS_NOT_DEBUG, OPT_fmove_loop_invariants, NULL, 1 },\r\n       { OPT_LEVELS_1_PLUS_NOT_DEBUG, OPT_ftree_pta, NULL, 1 },\r\n       { OPT_LEVELS_1_PLUS_NOT_DEBUG, OPT_fssa_phiopt, NULL, 1 },\r\n   ```\r\n- clang's -gX (other than -g1) are aliased to '-g', so, same behavior as gcc minus the macro definitions.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, debugging with -O0 is huge overkill due to all of the inlining, so it makes sense to me that gcc/clang chose -O1 as the starting point for debugging.\r\n\r\nI think we should use the flags that declare intent, as opposed to trying to guess about optimization levels. That way we benefit more from future compiler versions.\r\n\r\nSo my preference would be:\r\n- -Og with a fallback to -O1 if it doesn't work\r\n- -g3 with a fallback to -g if it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nWe could either nest the fallbacks in the original check's failure condition, or just set a variable if the original check fails, and try the fallback if it's false. My slight preference would be for the latter, just because it's more readable.",

In 9b4e03b27b04f6dc687409a13859d59bb7909d8f he added logic to first try to undefined the flag before setting it. Since we now pass in the debug/error flags, if the -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 check fails I retry with the undefine change. This should mean that if you use --enable-werror the right thing will happen if just setting -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 warns unless it's first undefined. I don't have a compiler that warns in this case, and I'd like Luke to check if he thinks this makes sense.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the _FORTIFY_SOURCE change is a lot less necessary in the first place now since the original error was related to -O0, and we're now preferring -Og (and the warning was a GCC thing in the first place). We could just drop the _FORTIFY_SOURCE change altogether since the logic is a bit confusing; that said, the new logic I added seems a little bit better.",
