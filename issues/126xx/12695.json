   "body" : "This fixes two minor things. First there are `x$GCC` and `x$GXX` checks in the `--enable-debug` path, but those checks are pointless because those variables are always set (even when clang is used). Since all compilers we use support these flags we don't need to check for support.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a slightly more annoying problem with `./configure --enable-debug` and no hardening flags explicitly set. Currently in that case we would still add `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` to `HARDENED_CPPFLAGS`. However, `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1` and greater are incompatible with `-O0`. This ends up producing compiler warnings on all of the source files that use `HARDENED_CPPFLAGS` which makes the build output very noisy.",
