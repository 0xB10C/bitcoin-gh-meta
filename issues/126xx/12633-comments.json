This proposal only standardizes overt asicboost using nversion rolling, which is the cleanest type of asicboost.  It doesn't require small\\empty blocks and is not dangerous in requiring transaction index permutation.\r\n\r\n>Merging this change would be an ultimate betrayal against the Bitcoin users, who depend on Bitcoin Core as trusted software that is supposed to be outside the influence of business interests.\r\n\r\nLet's wait for the rest of the community to react to this proposal before putting words in their mouths.",
