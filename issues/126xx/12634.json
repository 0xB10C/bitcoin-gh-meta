If it is replaced with a chain limit value calculator, that can be called once and reused, and is generally more flexible (see e.g. #12257).\r\n\r\nThis change also makes `nMaxAncestors` signed, as the replacement method will return `-1` for \"not in the mempool\", which is different from \"0\", which means \"no ancestors/descendants in mempool\".\r\n\r\nThis is a subset of #12257.",
