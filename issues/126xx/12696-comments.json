      "body" : "While I was looking at this again (originally to commit the undo data as @donaloconnor  suggested) I decided it would be nice if we could only sync the parent directory if we know there's actually a new block file on disk. The block files are 128 MB, so most of the time we're flushing we don't need to sync the parent directory.\r\n\r\nThe full logic for all of the paths that can cause a file to be created is really confusing. First I tried adding a global variable that tracks if a new file has been opened, so that we can only sync the directory when that's set. Then I was trying to understand the `fFinalize` flag so I could add a doxygen doc string to `FlushBlockToDisk()`. The full code path for how this can get called is pretty confusing and the methods aren't well documented, but it seemed like it was true in the same cases that there would be a new file, since we \"finalize\" (i.e. truncate) the file when the is not \"known to already reside on disk\". But why exactly we would need to truncate a file that doesn't exist yet is unclear. I think it's to support reorgs, but it was kind of hard to wrap my head around.\r\n\r\nSince this is pretty important logic I feel like some of these code paths at least need better comments. I am going to take another look through the code tomorrow and see if I can work it out. Maybe we end up always syncing the parent directory anyway since that's always safe, but I want to make sure I have a better grasp of all of the logic in this file.",
