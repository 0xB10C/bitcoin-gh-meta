The deprecation notice for `bitcoin-cli method` would simply be `Use \"bitcoin-util method\" instead`.\r\n\r\nA bigger issue is that some application may depend on calling `bitcoind` via RPC, perhaps on a different machine. A few things we could do:\r\n1. take a very long time to deprecate\r\n2. add a parameter to `bitcoind` that adds all utility functions via RPC, like e.g. `bitcoin-cli util-deriveaddress`\r\n3. let `bitcoin-util` run its own RPC server on a different port\r\n\r\nHowever (2 & 3): maintaining RPC wrappers around utility functions is some overhead, and extra complexity.\r\n\r\nIdeally `bitcoin-util` comes with a library that's easy to include in ruby gems, npm modules, etc.\r\n\r\nOne additional benefit of a separate utility is that you can switch between testnet and mainnet without restarting the node.",
