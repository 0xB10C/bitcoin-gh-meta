It mixes in everything the slow seeding mixes in, as well as OS environment data, performance monitoring data if available, and time the duration of sleeps.\r\n\r\nInitially \"slow\" and \"very slow\" can include OpenSSL as an entropy source, and when sufficiently many replacements are added, it can be dropped.\r\n",
