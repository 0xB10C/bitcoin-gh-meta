Maybe I have a different perception, but it seems to me the switch from `strLabel` to `m_label` is bigger than a switch from `UpdateLabel` to `updateLabel`. @sipa I'd be interested to know if you agree with that, or think allowing inconsistencies in the first place was a mistake, or if you just think benefits are greater in one case than the other.\r\n\r\nOn commitments to guidelines, I tend to think it's ok to have some guidelines that are just encouraged best practices and not enforced with a heavy hand, so maybe I can tweak this to weaken the suggestion a little.\r\n\r\nOn \"specific directories\", I don't really the love the idea of having different code styles for different directories. But a variation of that idea where we have a single, preferred style and a list of files/directories we say, \"this code is mature and was originally written in a different style, so please don't apply new guidelines here\" maybe could be reasonable.",

I think code consistency is more important than any particular style choice itself, unless that style has objectively been shown to improve code quality (for example, actual high-impact vulnerabilities have existed that were attributable to if-with-indented-then-but-no-braces). In this specific case, all other things aside I think having methods look different from functions may be somewhat beneficial, but it doesn't weigh up against introducing an extra way to go to make everything consistent.\r\n\r\nAs far as the existing snake_case / hUngarian discrepancy in the codebase goes, it was an intentional choice that I believe many people were on board with, as Hungarian style was the original, but even before the time snake_case became suggested, hardly anyone was following hUngarian. However, I think that everything else in the style document was written to match the existing code, rather than writing a style guide that would be optimal for a from-scratch project.\r\n\r\nI would be okay with \"these parts originated as separate projects which are quite mature now, so we're continuing their style there\".",
