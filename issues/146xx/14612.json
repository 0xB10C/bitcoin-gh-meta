   "body" : "As noted on IRC, the filenames of the gitian build results do not contain the 4th digit of the version number if it has one, e.g. 0.17.0.1 produces files with the number 0.17.0. Furthermore, when RC's are built, the resulting filenames are of the release version and do not include `rc` in them. This occurs because `configure.ac` is written to create version numbers of the form `major.minor.rev` instead of `major.minor.rev.build` and without any rc version as it does not handle rc numbers.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `configure.ac` to include the build number if it is greater than 0. It will also include the rc number if it is greater than 0. So the filenames of the gitian builds will now contain the full version number.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can be tested by setting `_CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD` and `_CLIENT_VERSION_RC` to non-zero values and then doing `make dist`. A tar file should be created with the correct versioning.",
