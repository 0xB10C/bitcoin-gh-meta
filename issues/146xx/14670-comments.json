      "body" : "This is simpler than #13501, and if it works I think it is preferable. Instead of trying to wait for all reply data to be sent before stopping the event loop and calling `evhttp_free`, it lets `evhttp_free` worry about this and stop the event loop itself. Assuming `http_free` does the right thing, this is a cleaner and less invasive.\r\n\r\nI am curious what exactly the behavior of `evhttp_free` is. For example if we are in the middle of sending a huge reply to a slow client, and the server is shut down, how long does this wait (if it waits at all) to send all the data before shutting down? IIUC #13501 would wait as long as it took, and currently we wait for 2 seconds.",
