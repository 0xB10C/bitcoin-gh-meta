   "body" : "This PR changes developer notes to suggest naming instance methods with `lowerCamelCase()`, and other functions with `UpperCamelCase()`.\r\n\r\nIn C++ methods, it's hard to see whether code that accesses a variable or calls a function will affect the current class instance, unless you've either memorized the names of all class members, or are using a coding convention like the `m_` convention we have now for variables.\r\n\r\nRight now we don't have an equivalent convention for distinguishing instance methods calls from global function calls, so I think allowing lowerCamelCase for this purpose could help with readability.",
