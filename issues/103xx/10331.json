   "body" : "The functional tests and util tests both require a config file that is\r\ngenerated by ./configure. This PR merges those two config\r\nfiles into a single configuration file that can be shared by both tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR also merges bctest.py and bitcoin-util-test.py into a single module.\r\nbctest.py is only used as an import by bitcoin-util-test.py. There's no\r\nvalue in keeping it as a separate module, so this PR merges them into a\r\nsingle module to keep building and packaging simpler.\r\n\r\nNote - this bumps the required python version for bitcoin-util-test.py to python 3.",
