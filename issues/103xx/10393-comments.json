      "body" : "Logging in the integration tests is much improved in the master branch. Are you able to check out the master branch and run this test against your current binary with the new test framework (it's now located in `test/functional/pruning.py` and the `rpc-tests.py` script is now called `test/functional/test_runner.py`). You can either checkout the branch in your current directory and not rebuild bitcoind, or if you don't want to checkout in your directory, you can checkout the branch elsewhere and use the `--srcdir` argument to specify where your bitcoind executable is. You should run the `pruning.py` script directly rather than through `test_runner.py`.\r\n\r\nYou can run with `--tracerpc` to trace out all the RPC requests/responses, `-l 10` to trace debug log to the console and `--nocleanup` to make sure the temp directory is not deleted after the test has completed. Once the test is completed you can see the logs from the test framework and bitcoind processes in the temp directory (the first line of the logs to console will be something like `Initializing test directory /tmp/testk070t0a2/590` which tells you where to find the temp directory)",
