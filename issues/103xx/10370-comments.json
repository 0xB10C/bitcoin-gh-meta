      "body" : "Having an independent address-index available somewhere may be handy and in general a great thing. Though, I'm not sure if we want to add this to the Bitcoin-Core repository. It already contains (too) much. Wallet, utilities, txindex, UI, p2p, consensus.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to keep the address-index (and all other sorts of indexes) in other repositories.\r\nSince Core offers ZMQ, creating an address-index via a python script/application (with it's independent leveldb dababase/layer) should not be very complex.\r\nThe python application could then handle the additional RPC commands.\r\n\r\nIf there are missing ZMQ features (I guess there is still an open PR for mempool ZMQ notifications), we should rather add those instead of the indexes.\r\n\r\nBut I'm open for other opinions.",
