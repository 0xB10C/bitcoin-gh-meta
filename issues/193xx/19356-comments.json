I've been convinced that changing BDB_CFLAGS to BDB_CPPFLAGS, while tantalizing, is not actually correct.\r\n\r\nAs for testing -- in my case, I had bdb@4 unlinked, bdb 18 linked, and the result was that anything that touched the wallet would segfault. It was picking up bdb 18 headers from /usr/local/include, but bdb 4 libraries from /usr/local/opt/blahblahblah. After my change it correctly picks up bdb 4 only (for me.)",
