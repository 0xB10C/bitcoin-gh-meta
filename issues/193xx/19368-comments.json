So It's reasonable to expect that the same workaround (reconnect and retry) would work. Though it is still a mystery to me why the connection would be reset in the first place, but I'm afraid that's beyond my understanding.\r\n\r\nI think we can try to enable the tests again. Would you suggest to have some prior discussion on IRC maybe or just re-enable the tests in this PR and let reviewers decide?",
