   "body" : "**This PR builds on #19316. Please review that first.** \r\n\r\nThe existing functional test framework uses the `addnode` RPC to spin up manual connections between bitcoind nodes. This limits our ability to add integration tests for our networking code, which often executes different code paths for different connection types. \r\n\r\n**This PR enables creating `outbound` & `block-relay-only` P2P connections in the functional tests.** This allows us to increase our p2p test coverage, since we can now verify expectations around these connection types.\r\n\r\nThis builds out the [prototype](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14210#issuecomment-527421978) proposed by ajtowns in #14210. ðð½\r\n\r\nAn overview of this branch:\r\n- cleans up `net.{h,cpp}` logic around handling different connection types. Introduces an enum so we can explicitly define what the connection type is rather than indicate via a set of flags & assert we don't have conflicting flags. This enables a lot of cleanup & includes a bug fix caused by silent assumptions. -> this is broken out into PR #19316. \r\n- introduces a new test-only RPC function `addconnection` which initiates opening an `outbound` or `block-relay-only` connection. (conceptually similar to `addnode` but for different connection types & restricted to regtest)\r\n- adds `test_framework` support so a mininode can open an `outbound`/`block-relay-only` connection to a `P2PInterface`/`P2PConnection`.\r\n- updates `p2p_blocksonly` tests to create a `block-relay-only` connection & verify expectations around transaction relay. \r\n\r\nWith these changes, there are many more behaviors that we can add integration tests for. The blocksonly updates is just one example. \r\n\r\nHuge props to ajtowns for conceiving the approach & providing me feedback as I've built out this branch. Also thank you to jnewbery for lots of thoughtful input along the way. ",
