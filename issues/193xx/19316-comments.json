Like, ADDRFETCH is also OUTBOUND.\r\n\r\nI think enum is the right approach. OUTBOUND here means a connection that is created automatically by the OpenConnections thread. Yes, there are other kinds of connection that the node originates, but for clarity, I don't think those should be referred to as 'OUTBOUND'.\r\n\r\nI think we definitely don't want a bitmask of different connection capabilities. That leads to an combinatorial explosion of connection types that you need to either test or explicitly disallow. ",
