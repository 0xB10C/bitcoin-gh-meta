      "body" : "@naumenkogs its a good question to ask, but I think enforcing mutual exclusivity makes more sense and what allows for a lot of the simplicity. @jnewbery explained the main reasons, I want to add some additional points\r\n- everything but `INBOUND` originates from the node, but `OUTBOUND` refers to a specific type, which is the most common, full-relay, outbound connection. so I do think its exclusive to the other connection types. on the enum I added `OUTBOUND, // full relay connections (blocks, addrs, txns)`, but lmk if you have suggestions on how it could be clarified better.   \r\n- if we support combinations, we have to add many behavioral checks to ensure logical adherence. lots of the cleanup in this PR shed light on how brittle/annoying it is to have those checks scattered everywhere. so, I think if we are adding connection types in the future, designing the conn_type to fit into the flat structure better supports code-simplicity-over-time as well. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn a different note, I have a question with the fuzz tests & would appreciate any guidance. \r\n\r\nSince I change the signature of the `CNode` constructor, I'm causing a [test failure](https://travis-ci.org/github/bitcoin/bitcoin/jobs/699509978). I found [this function](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/test/fuzz/FuzzedDataProvider.h#L184) to support fuzz testing with enums, but am unclear on how to implement. It seems I need to add `kMaxValue` to the enum. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if the pattern is: \r\na) mimic the enum in the tests & add `kMaxValue` there, or \r\nb) import something into `net.cpp` and define directly on the code implementation of the enum.\r\nOption B seems strange to add that dependency to `net`, but option A seems like it would be easy to forget to add an enum type to the fuzz test if we add a type to the cpp code in the future. \r\n\r\n@practicalswift, @MarcoFalke, any chance either of you are able to advise? ðð½",
