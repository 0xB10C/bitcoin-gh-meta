      "body" : "@michaelfolkson This is not about running them, but *building* the fuzz test code - without actual fuzzing enabled. The advantage is that you'd notice when a change you're making breaks the fuzz tests.\n\nThis is similar to why we build the benchmarks by default, even when you're not interested in benchmarking: even if you don't, the benchmarks shouldn't break.\n\nActual fuzzing requires re-building with a whole different set of compilation options (and possibly a different compiler). Making that easier would be great too, but seems pretty hard. Yet, the code that implements the tests should be buildable easily by anyone who can build the rest of the code.",
