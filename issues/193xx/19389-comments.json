Make sure that whatever changes you plan on making are compatible with Python 3.5, as that is our minimum supported version of Python.\r\n\r\nThis is a very important point, I've updated the issue to reflect it.  In particular this means that we must use type comments, as opposed to type hinting, in variables that aren't function parameters.  (i.e. `foo # type: int` as opposed to `foo: int`).  This will complicate the use of MonkeyType, as it doesn't support type comments.  It may be easy to make a scripted diff between type comments and type hints.\r\n\r\n>Why would you use stub files for in-tree modules? Why not add the type annotations in the implementation file?\r\n\r\nafaik we will need to do both, and this is simply a limitation of MyPy's design.  I'm more than happy to be proven wrong!",
