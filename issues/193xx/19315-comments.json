That's one of the mitigation we talked offline against time-dilation and it should prevent you against unknown in-protocol eclipses. This is experimental software ofc, beware of not killing any kittens :)",

The provided commit is for experimentation-only and MUST NOT be used in production for reasons aforementioned.\r\n\r\nFor anyone reading this and providing more context, Lightning nodes interested to prevent against time-dilation attacks (a no-hashrate eclipse variant against offchain protocols) should have multiple access to the chain view. As of today, the classic infra setup is to run the LN stack on top of _one_ full-node, if this one gets sybilled and partitioned from the rest of the network, the channel funds are at risk. Running a self-hosted or controlled secondary node connected to your main node would mitigate at least eclipses due to weaknesses in addr management or peer selection. As of today, we do have automatic block-relay-only peers, for which in theory their topology should stay masked to an external observer. But a bug in peer selection may be leveraged to lure block-only-relay connections to attacker controlled-peers. Adding redundant _manual_ block-relay-only connections will prevent this. Manual block-only secondary nodes won't fit there as they do leak addr-relay, which can be used to learn about their presence.\r\n\r\nProvided commit (https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/ea9943251b051a59d1b4cc7ae0ff34aeaea441f4) let you experiment such primary/secondary block-relay-only topology setup. There is no guarantee that anything will stay stable. If by playing with it, you do see value in this configuration, please concept ack and help to review downstream branches. If you don't understand what you're doing don't use it or ask questions.\r\n\r\n ",
