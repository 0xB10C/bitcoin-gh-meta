(I am prepared to defend my argument that BDB_CFLAGS is wrong here, and BDB_CPPFLAGS is right, but this could bite anybody who has gotten in the habit of -- or scripted -- setting the former.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn OS X, when searching Homebrew keg-only packages for BDB 4.8, if we find it,\r\nuse BDB_CPPFLAGS and BDB_LIBS instead of CFLAGS and LIBS for the result. This\r\nis (1) more correct, and (2) necessary in order to give this location\r\npriority over other directories in the include search path, which may include\r\nsystem include directories with other versions of BDB.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, switch all our usages of BDB_CFLAGS to BDB_CPPFLAGS. The former\r\nis specific to the C compiler, whereas the latter is used for both C and C++\r\ncompilation (which is what we want.) Previously, the bitcoin_find_bdb48.m4\r\nconfigure script would look for BDB_CFLAGS for input, but then put the result\r\ninto BDB_CPPFLAGS in order to build -- this looks like a hack to fix some past\r\nbroken build, but the correct approach is not to use BDB_CFLAGS at all.\r\n\r\n",
