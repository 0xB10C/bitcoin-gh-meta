Could you point me to those places where it'd be a concern?\r\n\r\n\"Most of our net code is single-threaded, so it's not a problem to hold cs_main longer\" is thinking about this the wrong way round. Instead, it makes more sense to say \"we hold cs_main almost everywhere in net_processing, so our current opportunities for parallelism are limited\". Breaking up cs_main has a couple of very important benefits: firstly, it reduces the coupling between validation and net_processing and enforces a cleaner separation between those components. That's good because it allows better testing of individual components and reduces the cognitive overhead when thinking about changes in either. Secondly it allows the possibility of parallelism between net_processing and validation. That's something that's been discussed and proposed many times before:\r\n\r\n- \"The biggest gain I'm aware of from concurrency is that right now when connecting multiple blocks at a time (due to out of order fetching in IBD) we stop downloading new blocks ... fixing that would be a big gain; so it might be worth prioritizing improvements that would let that happen.\"\r\nhttp://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2018/bitcoin-core-dev.2018-05-03-19.00.log.html#l-256\r\n- \"relaying compact block gettxn during block connection [...] is the one big cheapish win left for block-relay-latency\"\r\nhttp://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2018/bitcoin-core-dev.2018-05-03-19.00.log.html#l-258\r\n- \"Explicitly simplifying the concurrency model hopefully reduces a bit the cognitive burden of future code changes...\"\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12934#issuecomment-383747761\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16323\r\n\r\nImplementing parallelism between validation and net_processing would be useful, but without reducing cs_main scope in net_processing, the gains are limited:\r\n\r\n> It's not going to be really at all useful until we do a ton of locking cleanups in net_processing (it'll let us run ahead to the next message, which almost always requires cs_main, and we'll end up blocking on validation anyway).\"\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12934#issuecomment-385131498\r\n\r\n> It seems to me that there are two things going on here: one is moving application layer code to net_processing data structures and out of net data structures, which seems like an obvious win to me (adding some new p2p features can be tedious because of the current split). The other is redoing the locking, which is less clear to me;\r\n\r\nCurrently, the model is that the per-peer data in CNode is owned by net, with synchronized access managed by mutexes in net. The proposal here is to change that so the data is owned by net_processing, with synchronized access managed by mutexes in net_processing. That's not currently possible because access to CNodeState is managed by a mutex in validation (cs_main). Hence the need to add a structure to net_processing whose access is managed by mutexes in net_processing.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (moving the data to have synchronized access managed by validation) is adding technical debt. Everything moved under cs_main will need to be unwound if we want to get the full benefits of making validation asynchronous.\r\n\r\nMore generally speaking, it's just good practice to have finer grained locks and to hold those locks for the minimum time possible:\r\n\r\n> Hopefully it's obvious that if you have one mutex protecting an entire data structure, not only is there likely to be more contention for the lock, but also the potential for reducing the time that the lock is held is diminished. More of the operation steps will require a lock on the same mutex, so the lock must be held longer. This double whammy of a cost is also a double incentive to move toward finer-grained locking wherever possible.\r\n> \r\n> As this example shows, locking at an appropriate granularity isn't only about the amount of data locked; it's also about how long the lock is held and what operations are performed while the lock is held. _In general, a lock should be held for only the minimum possible time needed to perform the required operations_. [emphasis his] This also means that time-consuming operations such as acquiring another lock (even if you know it won't deadlock) or waiting for I/O to complete shouldn't be done while holding a lock unless absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAnthony Williams, C++ Concurrency In Action\r\n\r\n> Also, relating to the moving of data structures between net and net_processing, I think it'll be important to understand what you imagine the interface between those two modules to look like.\r\n\r\nI'm not proposing any changes to the interface here (except moving data that is only used in net_processing into net_processing). Once that movement is complete, further improvements to the interface may suggest themselves (and be easier to implement), but for now the goal is just to untangle the data ownership model between the two.\r\n\r\n> I suppose understanding how you expect the locking/synchronization to work would make sense as well, as that might also show how tightly coupled these changes are?\r\n\r\n> (A gist that explains all this at a high level would be very helpful.)\r\n\r\nThis is implemented in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19607. It's a pretty small PR, so should be fairly easy to review. I don't think I can add any clarity in a gist, but if there's anything that's unclear in the code, I'm very happy to expand the code comments so it's clear what's going on. https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/2020-06-cs-main-split builds on that and moves the CNode members into the new Peer structure.",

      "body" : "> \"Most of our net code is single-threaded, so it's not a problem to hold cs_main longer\" is thinking about this the wrong way round. Instead, it makes more sense to say \"we hold cs_main almost everywhere in net_processing, so our current opportunities for parallelism are limited\".\r\n\r\nMy point was that you're calling this locking issue a blocker; work gets done more quickly when there are fewer blockers, so I was trying to probe whether this is actually so.  This is not the same as suggesting that we not pursue parallelism!  But a question about whether we can pursue parallelism, ahem, in parallel with these other changes, rather than serially.\r\n\r\nFor example, another way to achieve your goals would be to dump everything into CNodeState, and then have a separate PR that unlocks parallelism by moving that which should not be synchronized by cs_main into something protected by its own lock. That's a worse strategy than doing it right the first time, to be sure, but to code reviewers who don't yet know how it's going to work eventually, it's hard to verify that what you're doing is right to begin with.\r\n\r\nFrom reading everything you wrote, it seems like the main motivation behind the locking changes you're proposing is in support of parallelizing validation with net_processing.  Is that correct?  If so, I think it would be helpful to understand what the semantics of such parallelism would look like, in order to understand what locking semantics are useful in support of that concurrency.  Ideas on how to parallelize net processing with validation have indeed been thrown around for years by many different people, but I'm not aware of any design that has been circulated to help us all understand what can be parallelized and, importantly, what cannot or should not be.\r\n\r\nFor example, one question I have is whether your design will allow for parallelizing net_processing with itself -- can we support more than 1 message processing thread?  Are the design considerations for that different than if we just have 1 message processing thread?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if there is a small specific proposal (like asynchronous ProcessNewBlock) that is achievable on top of the specific refactors you're proposing, then that could be a great way to demonstrate why the design you're picking makes sense.  But in the absence of a concrete goal it's very hard for me to say that one design is better than another -- I took a brief look at #19607 and it seems fine to me, but if you moved everything into CNodeState that would seem fine to me as well.  If one of those designs works and the other doesn't for a feature we want, then obviously we should pick the design that works.  But until that point, it seems to me that in the absence of a design document that we all agree on, other contributors may offer up code changes that don't conform to your particular design philosophy, and it will be hard to argue whether one or another is correct/incorrect.\r\n\r\nAnyway I certainly don't mean to throw sand in the gears at all, because moving data structures out of net and into net_processing seems like a clear win, however you do it; I just want to explain why it's hard for me to understand the bigger picture about the path forward and why it should to be done in a particular way that you're proposing.",
