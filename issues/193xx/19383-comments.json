If your program generates a script with an uncompressed key and queries a segwit address from decodescript, aside from the fact it makes no sense to use an RPC for this the issue is not with the RPC but with the logic of your program.\r\n2. It's not _that_ dangerous; it's not like it's a wallet RPC that may return an unspendable address.\r\n3. The proposed fix is overkill (and any fix would be i think)\r\n4. Worst case funds are not _completely_ unspendable, only by standardness rules...\r\n\r\nh/t darosior",
