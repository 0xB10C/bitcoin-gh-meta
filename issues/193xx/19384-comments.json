      "body" : "> IIUC this doesn't let us detect problems with clean shutdowns?\r\n\r\n@promag Thanks for the question, I forgot to address this point indeed. There are many tests that stop/start nodes cleanly _during the execution_. If we want we can even create a dedicated test to verify proper node shutdown. This change only affects the procedure when we shutdown test environment _after the test_ itself is performed. So from what I see the change shouldn't decrease the scope of detectable problems.",
