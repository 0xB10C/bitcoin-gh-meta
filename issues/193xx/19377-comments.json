In practice, only one orphan transactions is ever evicted at a time (in `LimitOrphanTxSize()` which is only called after the 101st orphan has been added. Picking a random element from a 101-entry container is always going to be fast, whatever the underlying data structure, so I don't think there's any benefit to having a microbenchmark for this. On the other hand, there is a cost to adding it - it means that there's more work involved in changing or reviewing changes to the interface.",

Absent the details, I think having a benchmark is slightly preferable to not having a benchmark because it might catch accidental performance regressions.\r\n\r\nAnd since we don't have any user-facing compatibility concerns for tests in general, adding and removing tests can be done much more easily than (let's say) an RPC method. In general I think that the cost of a pull request that adds a test that passes can only be negative or null (when it is testing nothing). And it should always be an uncontroversial option to remove a not-too-useful test that is in the way of other changes/refactoring/features.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the specifics of this pull request, but I think in general we need more benchmarks (or fuzzers) for p2p tx relay, as that is the primary DoS attack vector on the live network.",
