      "body" : "@hebasto can you provide motivation for this change? In practice, only one orphan transactions is ever evicted at a time (in `LimitOrphanTxSize()` which is only called after the 101st orphan has been added. Picking a random element from a 101-entry container is always going to be fast, whatever the underlying data structure, so I don't think there's any benefit to having a microbenchmark for this. On the other hand, there is a cost to adding it - it means that there's more work involved in changing or reviewing changes to the interface.",
