   "body" : "The `BerkeleyBatch` class has 4 static functions that operate on `BerkeleyDatabase` or `BerkeleyEnvironment`. It doesn't make sense for these to be standalone nor for them to be static functions. So instead, move them from `BerkeleyBatch` into `BerkeleyDatabase` and make them member functions instead of static.\r\n\r\n`BerkeleyBatch::VerifyEnvironment` and `BerkeleyBatch::VerifyDatabaseFile` are combined into a single `BerkeleyDatabase::Verify` function that operates on that `BerkeleyDatabase` object.\r\n\r\n`BerkeleyBatch::Rewrite` and `BerkeleyBatch::PeriodicFlush` both took a `BerkeleyDatabase` as an argument and did stuff on it. So we just make it a member function so it doesn't need to take a database as an argument.\r\n\r\nPart of #18971",
