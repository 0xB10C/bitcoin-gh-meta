      "body" : "Concept ACK.\r\n\r\n>   Here or follow up, makes sense to also assert type of returned UniValue?\r\n\r\nFWIW I dislike the idea of doing this at run-time. We don't want RPC to suddenly crash because an argument doesn't match its specified type in the help.\r\nThe extra checking also adds overhead on every RPC call.\r\nIt might make sense for something that is enabled with other heavier debug checks, enabled during the tests.\r\n\r\n> Removing all python regex linters on the args, now that RPCMan can be used to generate any output, including the cli.cpp table\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat difficult. It was considered in the past but\r\n\r\n- It would be undesirable to link the server-side tables into the CLI, as this either pulls in the associated implementations or splits the table in yet another way.\r\n- The CLI table could be spit out by some command line flag to `bitcoin`, however because of cross-compilation we don't want the build process to depend on being able to run the generated executable (and it needs to be possible to build -cli without -d).\r\n- `bitcoin-cli` could stop hardcoding the table completely but request it, over the network, from `bitcoind`. This is the most elegant option in a certain regard, but, one would want to cache this table (and not load it on every request). Getting the cache invalidation strategy (when changes) right is non-trivia,l though.\r\n",
