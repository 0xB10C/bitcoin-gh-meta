   "body" : "Builds on top of #28008 and #28165, and part of #27634. Draft while dependencies and (more) tests are missing.\r\n\r\nThis implements the BIP324 v2 transport and application layer. It is currently only accessible through the test-only `-bip324=` command-line option, which specifies IPs, host names, or subnets for which to use BIP324 connections. This option is only added in order to make experimentation possible; I don't expect it will be supported long-term (or should even remain in this PR).\r\n\r\nStill missing features are:\r\n* Support for the `NODE_P2P_V2` service flag.\r\n* Automatically trying V2 connections when the service flag is set.\r\n* Retrying downgrade to V1 when attempted outbound V2 connections immediately fail.\r\n* P2P functional tests (only a fuzz test for the transport is included, and a few bitcoind-to-bitcoind functional tests)\r\n\r\nOther than that, support for V2 connections is functionally complete, including:\r\n* Autodetection of incoming V1 connections.\r\n* Garbage, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Short message type IDs, both sending and receiving.\r\n* Ignore packets (receiving only, and untested).\r\n* Session IDs are visible in `getpeerinfo` output (for manual comparison).\r\n",
