For those who want to limit data carrying outputs, `-datacarriersize` is still supported, and has the functionality of applying the specified data carrier limit as well as limiting the number of data carrying OP_RETURN outputs to one. If `-datacarriersize=0` is set, no data carrying output is allowed.\r\n    \r\nRational: there's lots of ways for people to publish data in the Bitcoin chain, and lots of data has been published.  There's no reason for us to place artificial limits on this particular method.\r\n\r\nReplaces https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261\r\n",
