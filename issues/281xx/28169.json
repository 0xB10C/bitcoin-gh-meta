As opcodes rejected even in an unexecuted branch, are checked and throw error with an appropriate message(like disabled and codeseperator in non-segwit) to identify, op_verif and op_vernotif(which are rejected even in an unexecuted branch as well) should be treated in same way which is clear to debug\r\n2. It still makes script invalid now as both opcodes are in between op_if and op_endif, and go through all cases to default error, but it's such an inefficient to go through all cases even if it does not need to\r\n3. The message of  `BAD_OPCODE` is `\"Opcode missing or not understood\"`, which isn't accurate and confusing",
