   "body" : "We currently work around a longstanding GCC issue with aligned vector instructions, by patching the behaviour we want into GCC (see discussion in #24736). Possibly in response to the GCC thread (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54412#c40), a new option was [introduced into the binutils assembler](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=c8480b58e1968f209b6365af7422678f348222c2) with the 2.38 release:\r\n```\r\nx86: Add -muse-unaligned-vector-move to assembler\r\n\r\nUnaligned load/store instructions on aligned memory or register are as\r\nfast as aligned load/store instructions on modern Intel processors.  Add\r\na command-line option, -muse-unaligned-vector-move, to x86 assembler to\r\nencode encode aligned vector load/store instructions as unaligned\r\nvector load/store instructions.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not clear how much usage this (new) option is getting, but it came up during discussion today, and could quite possibly be more sane than continuing to patch our desired behaviour into GCC (see the [patch adjustments made for GCC 12](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27897/commits/796dd5ced062c83a41bffc5dfc3f51ba4fb140e6)).\r\n\r\nSome basic comparision of masters Guix built `bitcoind.exe`, and the Guix built binaries produced using this branch would suggest that it's working as intended. i.e dissasembling the binaries, and looking for aligned instruction usage, i.e `vmovdqa*` or `vmova*`, shows that they aren't being used, in favour of unaligned variants (`vmovdqu*` & `vmovu`). However note that there is a single usage of `vmovapd` in this branch _and_ the current release binaries.\r\n\r\nThis is based on #27897, for binutils `2.38`, GCC 12 (and the newer time machine), so in terms of this change, only the last commit is relevant.",
