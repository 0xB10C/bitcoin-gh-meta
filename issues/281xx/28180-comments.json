This is more an implementation issue rather than a missing doc or a missing restriction.\r\nThis could also happen without someone intending to do it. For instance, could be a higher bump fee that make the tx require another input.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises because the code (as is now) mixes two different concepts; it treats the change output and the reduce output (output from where the fees will be taken) as they would be the same, when they are not. It can easily be seen [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f4f1d6d230dd390f0524b8852b8cfc912d006958/src/wallet/feebumper.cpp#L250C12-L250C12).\r\nInstead of instructing the wallet to deduce the fee from certain output (by using SFFO), we discard the output from the recipients list and make the output script the custom change destination, so the wallet **automatically** adds the change output, at the end of the transaction creation process, going to the discarded output script, with an amount equal to the remainder: `inputs - outputs - new_bump_fee`.\r\n\r\nTo untangle the two concepts, we need to fix #27601 first. It is the reason why we drop the change output from the recipients list instead of simply mark it as SFFO (which would be the easiest implementation for a \"reduce output\" mechanism).",
