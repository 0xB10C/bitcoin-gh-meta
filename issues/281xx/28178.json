   "body" : "Sometimes a libFuzzer setting like `-use_value_profile=1` helps [0], sometimes it hurts [1].\r\n\r\n[0] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20789#issuecomment-752961937\r\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27888#issuecomment-1645976254\r\n\r\nBy picking a random value, it is ensured that at least some of the runs will have the beneficial configuration set.\r\n\r\nAlso, randomize `-max_len=` to possibly get some runs with faster iterations, or to produce smaller reduced fuzz inputs over time.\r\n\r\nAlso, randomize `-mutate_depth`, as lower values seem to be beneficial as well. [2]\r\n\r\n[2] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27888#issuecomment-1655477388\r\n\r\nAlso, set `-max_total_time` to prevent slow fuzz targets from getting a larger time share, or possibly peg to a single core for a long time and block the python script from exiting for a long time. This can be improved in the future. For example, the python script can exit after some time (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20752#discussion_r549248791). Alternatively, it can measure if coverage progress was made and run for less time if no progress has been made recently anyway, so that more time can be spent on targets that are new or still make progress.\r\n\r\nThis picks up the work started in commit https://www.github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20752/commits/1ff0dc525f051bbc7a93312dd622340ca8f4f52c ",
