   "body" : "Using a C-style cast to convert pointer types to a byte-like pointer type has many issues:\r\n\r\n* It may accidentally and silently throw away `const`.\r\n* It forces reviewers to check that it doesn't accidentally throw away `const`.\r\n\r\nFor example, on current master a `const char*` is cast to `unsigned char*` (without `const`), see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d23fda05842ba4539b225bbab01b94df0060f697/src/span.h#L273 . This can lead to UB, and the only reason why it didn't lead to UB is because the return type added back the `const`. (Obviously this would break if the return type was deduced via `auto`)\r\n\r\nFix all issues by adding back the `const` and using `reinterpret_cast` where appropriate.",
