   "body" : "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\r\n\r\nAdd a \"Bech32 string too short\" case to Bech32.cpp LocateErrors to reduce ambiguity and collisions with \"Invalid separator position\" case.\r\n\r\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\r\n\r\nError representation when calling LocateErrors within ```src/test/bech32_tests.cpp``` is ambiguous and incorrect in some cases because of a missing bech32 string to short case. Not having a too short case causes a fall though into the conditions of ```\"Invalid separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSimply add a check for a minimum Bech32 string size after or during the check for the maximum size which is already implemented.\r\n\r\nCascading effects of this would be seen in DecodeDestination if https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/32c15237b656209b932c5d6d2e20736c0e3d5a34/src/key_io.cpp#L85-L86 was patched to not consider bech32 invalid then attempt to Base58Decode it becuase of the incorrect HRP for the current chain.\r\n\r\nReferenced in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26290\r\n\r\nPR \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27260\r\n\r\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nYou could case this into other logic on a case by case basis in code. Example make a speical case inside DecodeDestination to display the correct error message to the user by if LocateErrors returns 'Invalid ```\"separator position\" || \"Missing separator\"``` then you check to see if the string is to short.\r\n\r\n### Please leave any additional context\r\n\r\nAs an aside there is already a check for string length greater than 90 (MAX LEN)\r\n\r\nin src/test/bech32_tests.cpp both [\"10a06t8\",\"1qzzfhee\"] produce ```{\"Invalid separator position\", {0}}``` The former is non conformant to BIP173 due not even having enough chars to represent a BASE32 string and the second genuinely has a wrong separator position.
