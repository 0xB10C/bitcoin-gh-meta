      "body" : "Didn't verify my theory in practice yet, but according to my calculations having a HRP of size 4 would exceed the current 117 character limit (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458/files#r1271312933). I assume the regtest-HRP should just also be set to \"tsp\" here (as it's currently stated in the BIP)? Otherweise the limit has to be raised by one.\r\n\r\nFun fact: in #27827 the \"sprt\" HRP works, but this is because the pubkeys are encoded as x-only (see commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827/commits/3a0d081ee07f3c65220a45855c96bf35ac2643fd), i.e. the payload of the address is only 64 bytes instead of 66 bytes and hence the limit is not exceeded.",
