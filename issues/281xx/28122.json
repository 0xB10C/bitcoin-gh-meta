   "body" : "This PR is a sub-section of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827 and only implements the BIP logic without the wallet code. For the full PR with wallet logic, take a look at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827 .\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses strictly on the BIP logic and attempts to separate it from the wallet and transaction implementation details. This is accomplished by working directly with public and private keys, instead of needing a wallet backend and transactions for testing. Labels for the receiver are optional and thus deferred for a later PR.\r\n\r\nTest vectors from the BIP are included as unit tests.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing, it is strongly recommended you read https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458 and take a look at the reference python implementation on the BIP.\r\n",
