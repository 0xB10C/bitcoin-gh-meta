The use of emojis would create an inconsistent experience between platforms.\r\n\r\nMy emotional and personal objection is and I mean this in the nicest way possible. I don't like the 'vibe' the changes to more informal language creates. It also makes the document less concise. \r\n\r\n- The phrase ```Curious to know more? Find further details``` feels like a pitch almost as compared to the current ```Further information about Bitcoin Core is available```\r\n\r\n- Use of an exclamation point in ```It downloads and validates transactions and blocks in real-time!``` feels forced and again like a pitch. Don't get me wrong I love me some freshie blocks and TXs but...\r\n\r\n- Emojis make this feel like an AI model or application repo see https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT my preference is to have very concise unbiased language and visuals. Visuals should also not induce bias. This could be construed as good or bad.",
