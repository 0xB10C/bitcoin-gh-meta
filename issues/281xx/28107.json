   "body" : "We currently have two different identifiers for transactions: `txid` (refering to the hash of a transaction without witness data) and `wtxid` (referring to the hash of a transaction including witness data). Both are typed as `uint256` which could lead to type-safety bugs in which one transaction identifier type is passed where the other would be expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces explicit `Txid` and `Wtxid` types that (if used) would cause compilation errors for such type confusion bugs.\r\n\r\n(Only the orphanage is converted to use these types in this PR)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI would consider this a low-priority but long term worthwhile change. Looking for conceptual feedback.",
