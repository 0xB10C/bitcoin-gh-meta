When would full-rbf be \"by default\"?\r\n\r\nThis pull-req has nothing to do with Initial Block Download (IBD).\r\n\r\nIt simply changes the default for the `-mempoolfullrbf` option to true/enabled. Previously the default was false/disabled. Users who update Bitcoin Core to a version containing this change would by default propagate and mine full-rbf replacements unless they had chosen to disable full-rbf.\r\n\r\nA significant fraction of the P2P network has already chosen to enable full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements propagate reasonably well. Almost half of pools by hash power has enabled full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements that reach those miners are readily mined, as seen on https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf and https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/",

      "body" : "On the first line of arguments, I think zero-conf business acceptance have the option to deploy additional full-nodes with good transaction-relay peering to obtain a reasonable view of network mempools, and therefore increase their odds of seeing a double-spend of a confirmation of interest. In practice, zero-conf applications have risk threshold, once those thresholds are reached they will deactivate zero-conf acceptance.\r\n\r\nOn the second line or arguments, mempool consistency with miners is becoming a practical concern in my opinion with the appereance of so-called âtransaction acceleratorsâ, as now LSPs can use those out-of-band transaction-relay service to fee-bump their stuck multi-party transactions, and therefore provoke a divergence with the rest of the network. I raised this risk of [âmining income asymmetries due to unequal access in to transaction flows bypassing policiesâ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26438#issuecomment-1299522242) in Suhas proposal to remove the mempoolfullrbf option months ago.\r\n\r\nOn the third line of arguments about the enhancement of multi-party funded transactions flows, the original motivation is explained in this [post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-May/003033.html) on the lightning dev mailing list. RBF opt-out allows a counterparty contributing an input to block the confirmation of a multi-party transaction at minimal cost, therefore enabling a liquidity griefing at low-cost (size of the pinning tx * mempool min fee).\r\n\r\nSince then, early Lightning Service Providers deploying dual-funding have raised again the [concern](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003920.html) on the mailing list during May of this year, and how sustained RBF signaling flag opt-out can be an annoying vector of pinning attack. While from my understanding the issue might be solved on the Lightning-side by upcoming deployment of nversion=3 (where full-rbf is implied by the policy regime), this wonât solve the pinning issue for coinjoin multi-party transactions which are concerned too (and this is not sure that weâre deploying nversion=3 for the dual-funding/splicing flows due to package limits size). With that context in mind, full-rbf by default is a welcome deployment for second-layers and multi-party applications.\r\n\r\nOn the deployment schedule, weâre still mid-26.0 schedule, so I think itâs reasonable to land it now (feature freeze scheduled for 2023-10-01 as of today July 24th). This still gives a period of roughly 5 months to zero-conf business and other software that would need to tweak their software.\r\n\r\n37% of the hash power sounds a reasonable demonstration of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem selecting the transaction-relay policy favoring maximization of their mining income strategy.\r\n\r\nSo Iâm Concept ACK on this change, I still think this change deserves announcement on the mailing list and usual technical communication channels to warn ecosystem stakeholders impacted by the proposed change.",

My OTS calendars bump fees repeatedly, increasing the feerate by 1sat/vb with each replacement, starting at approximately the minimum relay fee. Every single one of those replacements is actually a long string of multiple replacements. mempool.space does not maintain replacement data beyond 24 hours or so; if you want to see live replacement data you can do to https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ or https://bob.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ and just click on any of the recently mined transactions to see mempool.space's replacement history data on them. You can also see full-rbf replacements at https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf, which I linked above as well.\r\n\r\nPlease delete your comment as it is factually incorrect and misleading. Frankly I'm surprised that you are so unaware of current mempool policies in use by miners that you were unaware of the fact that full-rbf has been widely adopted.",

I don't think that's just a fad at this point. However I'm inclined to wait a little bit longer, e.g. after the v26 release, to see if your observations are maintained and reproduced outside of OTS. The new mempool.space tracking is helpful here.\r\n\r\nIn the release notes we should remind wallet users to not (yet) stop using the RBF flag, because their peers may not reliably relay it.\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-July/021823.html",
