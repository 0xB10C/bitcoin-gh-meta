When would full-rbf be \"by default\"?\r\n\r\nThis pull-req has nothing to do with Initial Block Download (IBD).\r\n\r\nIt simply changes the default for the `-mempoolfullrbf` option to true/enabled. Previously the default was false/disabled. Users who update Bitcoin Core to a version containing this change would by default propagate and mine full-rbf replacements unless they had chosen to disable full-rbf.\r\n\r\nA significant fraction of the P2P network has already chosen to enable full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements propagate reasonably well. Almost half of pools by hash power has enabled full-rbf, so full-rbf replacements that reach those miners are readily mined, as seen on https://mempool.space/rbf#fullrbf and https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/",
