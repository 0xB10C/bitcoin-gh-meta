I have been running a Bitcoin node on a Windows 10 computer for several years and had never experienced a Bitcoin Core crash before. \r\n\r\nI had been running Bitcoin Core v23.0 since if first came out but left the node unattended for a few weeks this summer. I restarted it earlier this week and the Bitcoin Core log window showed its data base was several thousand blocks out of sync. The last I saw on the Bitcoin Core log window was that it had some 50 blocks to go to complete the synchronization. I do not know if the synchronization finished or not, but a few hours later I noticed the Bitcoin Core log window gone and the bitcoin-qt.exe process disappeared from the task manager process list. \r\n\r\nI restarted Bitcoin Core and surprisingly the log window showed its data base was more than one thousand blocks out of sync. In other words, it lost a large number of blocks in the crash. I rebooted the windows computer and restarted Bitcoin Core three more times but it crashed within a few hours each time. I updated Bitcoin Core to v25.0 hoping that the latest version would fix the problem. Unfortunately, I tried v25.0 several times and it crashes within a few hours each time. \r\n\r\nI reran Bitcoin Core from the command prompt window (bitcoind.exe) with the debug option and wrote its output to a file (bitcoinlog.txt), which I am including below to help identify the problem. I would really appreciate it if anyone would could give me some guidance on how to fix this problem, so I can get my Bitcoin node back up and running. \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nExpected my Bitcoin node to sync up to the Bitcoin blockchain and continue to load new blocks like it has reliably done for several years now.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRestarted Bitcoin Core (bitcoin-qt.exe) after some 4 or 5 weeks offline.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n[bitcoinlog.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/12127528/bitcoinlog.txt)\r\n\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv25.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nWindows 10 Version 22H2\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nUsing a Windows 10 computer running Intel Core i7-8565 CPU with 8 GB RAM and 2 TB HDD.",
