   "body" : "The Windows 32 bit build was recently removed:\r\n* #15939: `gitian: Remove Windows 32 bit build`\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with the following supported 32 bit platforms:\r\n\r\n* `arm-linux-gnueabihf` (compiled in Travis)\r\n* `i686-pc-linux-gnu` (compiled and tested in Travis)\r\n\r\nAs the number of developers testing on these platforms decrease the probability of errors due to incorrect assumptions about `sizeof(size_t)`, `sizeof(time_t)` and `sizeof(long)` is likely to increase.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we risk incorrectly assuming that reported errors on said platforms are 32 bit only bugs: the recent GCC miscompilation issue would likely have been identified much faster if it wasn't thought to be \"merely\" an `i686-pc-linux-gnu` issue for the first six months after being reported (see history in #14580: `32-bit test failure: test/crypto_tests.cpp`).\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n1. What can be done to improve testing under these platforms until we drop support?\r\n2. In which order do we envision dropping support for the mentioned platforms?",
