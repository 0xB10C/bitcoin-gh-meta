Since then there have been 3 releases & still the problem persists. I know you guys are busy, but that's pretty lame. How is a casual user supposed to know about this & how to fix it? Suddenly being unable to send payments from one's wallet for no apparent reason is enough to scare anyone, especially as there is no mention of this in the release notes of any of those 3 releases.\r\n\r\nSomething in the release notes along the lines of \"You might suddenly be unable to send coins from your own wallet for no reason if you upgrade to any version above 17.1 - this is a long known about issue\" would be appropriate - at least users would then be aware & decide if they want to be locked out of their own wallets - only to get asked for a \"review\" here when asking for help.",
