   "body" : "This is another couple of minor tweaks to `bumpfee` that I'd hope to merge for 0.14.\r\nBuilt on top of #9589\r\n\r\nIntroduce `WALLET_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE`\r\nHave wallet's default bump value be higher than the default incrementalRelayFee to future proof against changes to incremental relay fee.  Only applies when not setting the fee rate directly.\r\nIf we ever decide that we'd like to raise the default incrementalRelayFee or nodes on the network start doing it, it would be a shame if old software was generating replacements that didn't relay.  5000 satoshis/KB is a compromise between being sufficiently future proof and not losing too much precision in our ability to bump fees.   \r\n\r\nIncidentally I do think the incrementalRelayFee is too low and that the \"cost\" to the network of relaying a transaction around is above 1000 satoshi/KB and there is insufficient benefit on having that much precision to bumpfee and mempool limiting.  I don't feel like getting in a big argument about changing the default though.  But my recommendation would be to change the default to 5000 satoshis.  \r\n\r\nChange `bumpfee` result value from 'oldfee' to 'origfee'.\r\nThe result value indicates the actual fee on the transaction that was replaced. But there is an error message which uses the description 'oldfee' to refer to the original fee rate applied to the new transaction's estimated max size.  It was confusing that two different uses of 'oldfee' had two different numeric values.\r\n",
