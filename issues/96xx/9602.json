   "body" : "Please see #9601 for all non-technical discussion.\r\nIncludes #9391 as the first commit\r\nPlease tag 0.15\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all coin age priority functionality from the codebase.\r\n\r\nSome remaining open questions:\r\n- The `prioritisetransaction` RPC API is broken.  Should we instead try to implement backwards compatible support, or is it fair to break it?  Previously it required exactly 3 arguments, now it requires exactly 2, so it will not result in unintended consequences.\r\n- The 6th commit changes `sendrawtransaction` to no longer bypass minRelayTxFee by setting fLimitFree to false.  `prioritisetransaction` can always be used to achieve the same effect.  This seems an improvement in behavior, but isn't required (although the prioritise_transaction.py RPC test would need to be fixed if we don't include this).\r\n- fLimitFree is now only set for transactions we are trying to reaccept to the mempool from a disconnected block.  Should it also be used to bypass the mempool min fee in the event of mempool limiting.  I think yes, but can be left for a separate PR.\r\n-  The last commit is optional and introduces ability to set `-minrelaytxfee` to 0.  This isn't necessary, but seemed better to me especially now other ways to accept transactions without fee have been removed.\r\n\r\nFixes #9601\r\n",
