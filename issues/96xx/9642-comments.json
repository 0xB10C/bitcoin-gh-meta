      "body" : "Concept NAK.\r\n\r\nAt least on an initial impression: We haven't even been able to see/measure the effects of segwit doubling it-- increasing it again seems really imprudent, especially with the result going beyond what prior measurements suggested could be supported without massive decentralization losses. This change also likely leaves the supply radically above the transaction demand (well increasingly it looks like segwit will too, but this would make it worse), which would put the system back in an unstable state where fees don't adequately protect it from abuse and users have a bad experience any time a little load shows up, or when users gain unrealistic expectations about the costs of using it.\r\n\r\nAlso, calling it \"safe\" is misleading. It's like naming the PATRIOT act... who could oppose patriots, never-mind that there wasn't anything especially patriotic about it. You could plausibly call it safer, since it's certainly safer than some of the more outright reckless proposals. :)\r\n\r\nA procedural comment: directing people to not discuss the proposal here is bad form and was looked none to kindly on when Gavin tried it with BIP-101. Please don't do that.",
