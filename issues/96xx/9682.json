   "body" : "Require timestamps for importmulti keys\r\n\r\nAdditionally, accept a \"now\" timestamp, to allow avoiding rescans for keys\r\nwhich are known never to have been used.\r\n\r\nNote that the behavior when \"now\" is specified is slightly different than the\r\nprevious behavior when no timestamp was specified at all. Previously, when no\r\ntimestamp was specified, it would avoid rescanning during the importmulti call,\r\nbut set the key's nCreateTime value to 1, which would not prevent future block\r\nreads in later ScanForWalletTransactions calls. With this change, passing a\r\n\"now\" timestamp will set the key's nCreateTime to the current block time\r\ninstead of 1.\r\n\r\nFixes #9491",
