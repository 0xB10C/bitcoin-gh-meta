Otherwise it will make the gui impossible to use for some people.

This would require that your design is flexible to adapt colors according to the used scheme.\r\n\r\nI guess the Linux users would not be happy if we would force them to a pre-given scheme (force setting the Bitcoin-Core GUI colors). Also, this could be complex to achieve because I guess there are some internal control colors that need hacks to change.",
