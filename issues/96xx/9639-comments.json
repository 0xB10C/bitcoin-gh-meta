      "body" : "I think it is useful to change the appearance of the gui slightly for every (other) major release. This way we can combat the impression that \"nothing has changed\" since the last major release.\r\n\r\nThough, we need to make sure that the system style is not violated. Otherwise it will make the gui impossible to use for some people. (c.f. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8889#issuecomment-251606020)\r\nI really like the flat buttons, but I don't know if this is possible with qt.\r\n\r\nAssigned the 0.15 milestone in case someone want to give it a try.",
