Indeed, if it were set per-wallet, an easy way to get the intended behavior here is to simply encrypt your wallet with a garbage passphrase such that it can no longer be opened (not to say we shouldn't do this, better UX around that is good, but it might be easier to review/write if it re-used that infrastructure).",
