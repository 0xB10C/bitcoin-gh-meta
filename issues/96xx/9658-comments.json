      "body" : "The rationale for removing the predecessor was that (maybe) people\nwere confused which clang format script is meant for day-to-day dev\nactivity, so they used none. Lets hope this changes after we had the\ndiscussion in last weeks meeting and after deleting the unused script.\nSo there is only one script left with a description on how to use it.\nThough, I am not interested in enforcing the use of clang format, also\nI won't highlight any style nits in pulls, as I think it would be\ndistracting.\n\nIn regard to this pull, I think this is better placed in some meta\nrepository, so we can use it whenever appropriate but don't confuse\nregular developers by the number of scripts we put in the devtools\nsubdir.\n\nI submitted a pull request to the maintainers repo to archive the old\nversion: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/pull/7\nI think your script does fit really well into that repo as well.\n",
