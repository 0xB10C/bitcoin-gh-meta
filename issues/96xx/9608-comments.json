As noted, this can be indented later (although that obscures the git blame).\r\nIn other projects, having to read more than X nested control flows in function directly goes against the style and smaller functions can be always a solution to that. Others simply don't allow functions above N lines\r\n\r\nIMO, before this PR ProcessMessage is both too long and has some lines with too many nestings. It is very hard for me to read this function as it, and I suspect I'm not the only one.\r\n\r\n> I feel like this just obscures the control flow. :-/\r\n\r\nYeah, how so?",
