      "body" : "Concept NACK to removal from mining:\r\n\r\n* Miner(s) still use priority. Whether or not you agree with this, policy is not up to developers to decide and force on miners.\r\n* Coin age is a useful algorithm for altruistic miners who wish to keep the network functioning smoothly even during flood attacks.\r\n* Coin age ensures that so long as a non-spam transaction pays a reasonable fee, it will *eventually* get mined. (RBF may eventually make this assurance unnecessary, but we're not there yet.)\r\n* Using a single algorithm for block creation makes it significantly easier for floods to game the algorithm to DoS the entire network. Merely the existence of multiple different sorting algorithms for blocks helps avoid the situation where blocks are pure flood and legitimate transactions can't get through.\r\n* Regardless of past complications, the current code is cleanly isolated from the rest of the code, and a mere 100 lines. If it creates a burden for future modifications, removing priority can be put back on the table and weighed against the value of those modifications (or ported by someone interested in keeping it; eg, me).\r\n* Multiple algorithms for mining (regardless of what those algorithms may be) also avoids the situation where policy logic gets too deeply embedded into non-policy code, creating huge risks and burdens for anyone who wishes to customise it without modifying any non-policy code.\r\n\r\nI can alternatively maintain coin-age priority in Knots only, but I do not think Core should head in this direction of pushing a single specific political agenda at the exclusion of all others. If it does go that route, it should be made clear that Core is no longer a reference implementation, and its political agenda documented.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK to everything else (eg, removal of support for zero-fee transactions, and priority estimation)",
