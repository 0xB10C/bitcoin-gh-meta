I believe the script needs to live in the same repo for that to work.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to have a suite of scripts under `qa/`? Perhaps presented by a script named `qa/pull-tester/static-checks.py` similar to `rpc-tests.py`? I see a similar pattern where there is one threshold of checks that must be passed, but then another category of checks that are probably more tentative (for whatever reason - false-positives, etc.).",
