I think it's a rare (but important) enough case to warrant it.\r\n\r\nIt would definitely make it easier for RPC applications checking the validity of existing transactions to explicitly provide these when a reorg affects them. The only other alternative right now is to keep a list of transactions with confirmations less than some arbitrary number (100) and to loop through these every time a reorg is encountered to ensure they're actually still present.\r\n\r\nEdit: one concern of my own is whether a naive implementation would ignore the confirmations value and simply think the transaction existed in the chain, even though the opposite is the case. I wondered if maybe a different key for the returned results should be used, e.g. \"reorged\" or something. I.e. you would get `{\"transactions\": [list of txs that changed], \"reorged\": [list of txs that disappeared], \"lastblock\": <hash>}`...",

I personally expected listsinceblock to show me anything I needed to keep an updated score of what's going on since the given block. In that sense, not showing a transaction vanishing would probably be considered a bug.\r\n\r\nRegarding showing an existing transaction in both reorged and transactions, I patched this by ensuring that any tx shown from the main chain is skipped over in the reorged list. See the new `test_double_send` test.",

I would be more supportive of naming them `replaced` rather than reorged if I understand the semantics properly. Strictly speaking, I'd say a reorged txn is any transaction that was between the old tip and the fork point?\r\n\r\nI would also think maybe making this information available with a default false parameter may be a good idea to introduce less changes for current users/legacy code.",
