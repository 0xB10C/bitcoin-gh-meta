I think it's a rare (but important) enough case to warrant it.\r\n\r\nIt would definitely make it easier for RPC applications checking the validity of existing transactions to explicitly provide these when a reorg affects them. The only other alternative right now is to keep a list of transactions with confirmations less than some arbitrary number (100) and to loop through these every time a reorg is encountered to ensure they're actually still present.",
