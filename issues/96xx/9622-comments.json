I think it's a rare (but important) enough case to warrant it.\r\n\r\nIt would definitely make it easier for RPC applications checking the validity of existing transactions to explicitly provide these when a reorg affects them. The only other alternative right now is to keep a list of transactions with confirmations less than some arbitrary number (100) and to loop through these every time a reorg is encountered to ensure they're actually still present.\r\n\r\nEdit: one concern of my own is whether a naive implementation would ignore the confirmations value and simply think the transaction existed in the chain, even though the opposite is the case. I wondered if maybe a different key for the returned results should be used, e.g. \"reorged\" or something. I.e. you would get `{\"transactions\": [list of txs that changed], \"reorged\": [list of txs that disappeared], \"lastblock\": <hash>}`...",
