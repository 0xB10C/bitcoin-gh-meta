I'll let you know what happens after it confirms, but I strongly suspect it'll arrive back in my (visible) wallet. I have the private key for the address it's in (I double checked that :P), so there's absolutely no risk in that sense.\r\n\r\nI've never had a problem with the wallet and unconfirmed change, but it seems to have been triggered by the spending of spending unconfirmed change, if I had to guess.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut my big concern is, what would happen if the transaction chain never confirmed? Seems like it's possible someone could \"lose\" money this way",
