To confirm, this started with 0.13.2, but did not appear in 0.13.1?\r\n\r\nIf you could provide any more useful debug from the RPC client (ie does it report error codes in some way?) that would be useful, otherwise a tcpdump network capture (hopefully anonymized to only include the one port/IP, with a different rpcuser/password than normal and only local IPs) might be useful.",
