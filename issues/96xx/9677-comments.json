BitcoinD's current behavior is to terminate if that device not exists, which is a disaster as there are situations when it's totally untrivial or/and unsuitable to create such a device. (Also, why depend on the device's existence when it's technically unnecessary in the first place.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the very simplest approach would be to apply the arc4random() interface specifically to OpenBSD.
