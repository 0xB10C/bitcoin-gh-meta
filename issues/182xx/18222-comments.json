If the only concern is that wasabi currently uses a different (their own) filter type, and that updating a wasabi wallet to the BIP 158 filter type takes too much time (half a day), it could make sense to just have two wasabi wallet versions. New wallets can use the new version and old wallets can be upgraded by the user after educating them it might take a day.",
