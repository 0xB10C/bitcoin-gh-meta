   "body" : "When using `fundrawtransaction` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` with `lockUnspents`, it would only lock automatically selected coins, not manually selected coins. That doesn't make much sense to me if the goal is to prevent accidentally double-spending yourself before you broadcast a transaction.\r\n\r\nThis PR also locks manually selected coins, and adds tests for that.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a transaction, manually selected coins are automatic \"unlocked\" (or more accurately: the lock is ignored). I've kept that behaviour in place, since it appears to be intentional. E.g. from the `lockunspent` RPC: \"A locked transaction output will not be chosen by automatic coin selection, when spending bitcoins.\"\r\n",
