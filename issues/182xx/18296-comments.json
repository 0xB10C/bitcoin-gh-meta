      "body" : "Thanks for the response, but it does not really seem to address the actual issue. Specifically, Bitcoin Core's default relay policy prevents a transaction with exactly one (P2WPKH) vin and exactly one OP_RETURN vout from being recognized as \"standard\" unless the OP_RETURN contains at least 30 bytes or so of (possibly junk) data, because of the minimum size limit for a transaction, and I believe this might be an oversight as this restriction was only committed [less than two years ago ](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7485488e907e236133a016ba7064c89bf9ab6da3).",
