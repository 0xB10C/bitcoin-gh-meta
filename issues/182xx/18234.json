   "body" : "Replacing boost functionality with C++11 stuff.\r\n\r\nMotivated by #18227, but should stand alone. Changing from `boost::condition_var` to `std::condition_var` means `threadGroup.interrupt_all` isn't enough to interrupt `serviceQueue` anymore, so that means calling `stop()` before `join_all()` is needed. And the existing reverselock.h code doesn't work with sync.h's DebugLock code (because the reversed lock won't be removed from `g_lockstack` which then leads to incorrect potential deadlock warnings), so I've replaced that with a dedicated class and macro that's aware of our debug lock behaviour.",
