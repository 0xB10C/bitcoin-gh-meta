   "body" : "Currently the *.dat files in the blocksdir store the data received from remote peers as-is. This may be problematic when a program other than Bitcoin Core tries to interpret them by accident. For example, an anti-virus program or other program may scan them and move them into quarantine, or delete them, or corrupt them. This may cause Bitcoin Core to fail a reorg, or fail to reply to P2P or RPC block requests.\r\n\r\nFix this, similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6650, by rolling a random XOR pattern over the dat files when writing or reading them.\r\n\r\nObviously this can only protect against programs that accidentally and unintentionally are trying to mess with the dat files. Any program that intentionally wants to mess with the dat files can still trivially do so.\r\n\r\nThe XOR pattern is only applied when the blocksdir is freshly created, and there is an option to disable it (on creation), so that people can disable it, if needed. (Is this needed or can the option be dropped?) Should `linearize-hashes.py` be updated to apply the XOR pattern?\r\n\r\nOpening as draft for now, to see if this gets conceptual support?",
