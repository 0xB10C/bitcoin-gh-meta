Not sure if this is worth it, given that appveyor CI used to cost 50 USD/mo. Also, I am not sure if a sponsor can be found. Personally, I don't use macOS nor Windows, and I can't recommend it to anyone, so I don't mind if the tasks are removed. Though, I am opening this issue to gather feedback and alternatives.\r\n\r\ncc @jonasnick @real-or-random (You'll probably have to do something about this as well)\r\n\r\nThe alternatives I can see (someone would have to implement them):\r\n\r\n* Someone sets up Windows+macOS VMs and connects them to the `bitcoin` and `bitcoin-core` Cirrus CI account as a persistent worker. (I've only tested this with Linux, so no idea if it works)\r\n* Go back to appveyor, which was 50 USD/mo. (Probably doesn't support macOS though)\r\n* Something else?",
