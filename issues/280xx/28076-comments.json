(Just one example: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27921#issuecomment-1601003548, obviously the problem is a general one and it is left as an exercise to the reader to create a full list of past issues, including the ones that were more severe.)\r\nYes, I know that mypy exists, but no one uses it, it is incomplete, and it comes with many other issues.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the linter code already has a bunch of random dependencies, so adding one more shouldn't be an issue? Finally, it is entirely optional, and already run by CI, so no one is forced or even encouraged to run it. (Personally I can't recall the last time I've run any linter outside of testing one after writing the code for it.)",
