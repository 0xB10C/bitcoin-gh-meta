As you point out, we trust GitHub anyway. (Or we *don't* trust them anyway, in the sense that it's not the end of the world if they become hostile.) And GitHub Actions is hopefully more mature now, so I don't think the risk of vulnerabilities should be a showstopper.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn secp256k1, we currently rely on Cirrus CI's [\"Dockerfile as a CI environment\"](https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/docker-builder-vm/#dockerfile-as-a-ci-environment) feature for the Linux tasks. Moving away from it could require a bit of work. GitHub Actions apparently has a similar feature, but I haven't tried that one.",
