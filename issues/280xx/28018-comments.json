However, it does align with many of our other options to have a default port, and if that makes sense here too then the help  for `torcontrol` arg should be updated to show port as optional as a first step.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, even \"1\" is a valid value (it would be the same as 0.0.0.1:9051), though I suppose it wouldn't hurt to check for it specifically and reject it.\r\n\r\nWhilst this is technically true for low-level networking (code), IMO it's extremely un-common to **not** require users to use dot-decimal notation for hosts, and I think we should reject non dot-decimal hosts to prevent exactly the issue in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23589. We'll lose no flexibility by doing so as users who want to use 0.0.0.1 can just, set the option to that directly?",
