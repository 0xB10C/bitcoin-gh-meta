   "body" : "### Background\r\n\r\nIn the `i2p::sam::Session` class:\r\n\r\n`Listen()` does:\r\n* if the session is not created yet\r\n  * create the control socket and on it:\r\n  * `HELLO`\r\n  * `SESSION CREATE ID=sessid`\r\n  * leave the control socked opened \r\n* create a new socket and on it:\r\n* `HELLO`\r\n* `STREAM ACCEPT ID=sessid`\r\n* read reply (`STREAM STATUS`)\r\n\r\nThen a wait starts, for a peer to connect. When connected,\r\n\r\n`Accept()` does:\r\n* on the socket from `STREAM ACCEPT` from `Listen()`: read the Base64 identification of the connecting peer\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nThe I2P router may be in such a state that this happens in a quick succession (many times per second, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22759#issuecomment-1609907115): `Listen()`-succeeds, `Accept()`-fails.\r\n\r\n`Accept()` fails because the I2P router sends something that is not Base64 on the socket: `STREAM STATUS RESULT=I2P_ERROR MESSAGE=\"Session was closed\"`\r\n\r\nWe only sleep after failed `Listen()` because the assumption was that if `Accept()` fails then the next `Listen()` will also fail.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nAvoid filling the log with \"Error accepting:\" messages and sleep also after a failed `Accept()`.\r\n\r\n### Extra changes\r\n\r\n* Reset the error waiting time after one successful connection. Otherwise the timer will remain high due to problems that have been solved long time in the past.\r\n\r\n* Increment the wait time less aggressively.\r\n\r\n* Handle the unexpected \"Session was closed\" message more gracefully (don't log stupid messages like `Cannot decode Base64: \"STREAM STATUS...`) and destroy the session right way.",
