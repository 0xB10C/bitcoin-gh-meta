   "body" : "It would be useful to the project if there was a document detailing what features are considered \"out of scope\" of the Bitcoin Core Wallet. This would make evaluating wallet PRs that add features easier for reviewers. It would also be useful to contributors so that they can get a better sense of which features are more likely to get merged. I'm curious if anybody else thinks that such a document would be useful, and if there are any guidelines that should be added. These guidelines would probably be more directed towards things that are unlikely to get merged, rather than things that we find acceptable. \r\n\r\nSome examples of guidelines include the following:\r\n\r\n- Features shouldn't call any 3rd party APIs\r\n- Features shouldn't require any major changes to how the other parts of Bitcoin Core work",
