I strongly suggest that reviewers look at that PR first to decide if they are comfortable with the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly refactors, with a few behavior changes and improvements:\r\n- Introduces `TxPackageTracker`, which starts out as a wrapper for the `TxOrphanage`. This will be the main \"package relay\" module as well.\r\n- Adds a new log category, `TXPACKAGES`. Logging in the orphanage is changed from `MEMPOOL` to `TXPACKAGES`.\r\n- Adds support for tracking when multiple peers provided the same tx in the orphanage.\r\n- Makes `TxPackageTracker` responsible for tracking the orphans we need to resolve and deciding how/when to resolve them.\r\n    - In this PR, \"orphan resolution\" means requesting missing parents by `getdata(MSG_TX | MSG_WITNESS_FLAG, missing_txid)`.\r\n    - In a future PR, we'll add another resolution method, requesting ancestor wtxids using `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO, orphan_wtxid)`.\r\n- Adds all announcers of an orphan as potential resolution candidates. This tracker is a `TxRequestTracker` which helps us schedule requests. We preferentially request from outbounds by delaying requests to inbounds, limit the total in-flight tx requests (including non-orphan-related tx requests) to each peer, etc.",
