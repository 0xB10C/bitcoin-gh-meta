   "body" : "The `rpc` fuzz target was added more than two years ago in e45863166f5e44cc2c380f4667812fcd3cddc73b. However, the bug https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27913 was only found recently. Thus, it is pretty clear that fuzz engines can't deal with a search space that is too broad and can be extended in too many directions.\r\n\r\nFix that by limiting the search space to each RPC method name and then iterate over all names, instead of letting the fuzz engine do the iteration.\r\n\r\nWith this, the bug can be found in seconds, as opposed to years of CPU time (or never).",
