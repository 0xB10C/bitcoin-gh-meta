   "body" : "Our release binaries currently have a runtime dependency on `librt`. However this is redundant, and only the case due to  bug in glibc. The `clock_*` suit of funcs were absorbed into libc long ago, however an issue with compatibility code meant that librt would still be linked against / used redundantly:\r\n> But the forwarders were not marked as compatibility symbols.\r\n> As a result, on older architectures, historic configure checks such as\r\n> AC_CHECK_LIB(rt, clock_gettime)\r\n> still cause linking against librt, even though this is completely\r\n> unnecessary.  It also creates a needless porting hazard because\r\n> architectures behave differently when it comes to symbol availability.\r\n\r\nThis PR drops our configure check for librt (which is redundant, and could be PR'd standalone), and backports [the relevant patch](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=f289e656ec8221756519a601042bc9fbe1b310fb) into our glibc, so we can drop librt from our runtime dependencies.",
