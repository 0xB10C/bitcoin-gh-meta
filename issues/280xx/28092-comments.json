Although note that in that case we'd still be using mingw-w64, for the Windows headers/runtime etc, swapping out a GCC toolchain for an LLVM/Clang toolchain, so we'd still have to deal with issues like these in either case.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I'd really just like to remove the single `-Werror` special case, and put it into the CI config.
