   "body" : "This PR attempts to fix an intermittent Init issue encountered during the stress testing of #23289, which relates to the pruning-compatible filter reconstruction logic introduced in #15946. \r\n\r\nThe problem would occur when the node starts with `-txindex=1` but `ThreadSync` is interrupted after it sets `m_best_block_index` to Genesis, and before it gets do any further work.\r\nIn that case, during the next restart of the node, an Init error would be thrown because  `BaseIndex::Init()` tries to backtrack from the tip to the last block which has been successfully indexed (here: Genesis), but the backtracking logic didn't work properly in this case: \r\nThe loop \r\n`while (block_to_test && block->pprev && (block->pprev->nStatus & BLOCK_HAVE_DATA))` checks if a predecessor exists **before** performing the check `block_to_test == block` and then possbily setting `prune_violation = false` \r\nIf `block_to_test` and `block` are the Genesis block this check will not be reached because `block->pprev` does not exist.\r\n\r\nFix this by requiring that we have the data for the block of the current iteration `block` (instead of requiring it for the next one `block->pprev`) \r\nThat way, the check for `block_to_test == block` is also reached when `block_to_test` is the Genesis block.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
