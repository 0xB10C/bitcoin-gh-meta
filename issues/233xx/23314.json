   "body" : "This updates the libsecp256k1 subtree to the latest upstream, to take advantage of https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/983. That PR removed upstreams OpenSSL based tests, which due to issues with OpenSSL 3, can currently cause our `make check` to fail, due to a failure in the libsecp256k1 `tests`.\r\n\r\nThere may be a reason to update the subtree again somewhat soon, i.e after the merge of https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/988, but I'd like to perform this update now regardless, as having `make check` fail, now, just due to the fact that you may have a new version of OpenSSL installed on a system is suboptimal. This is the case on at least macOS with brew installed OpenSSL and Alpine Linux.\r\n\r\nNote that this will also remove warning output from our build, due to using deprecated portions of the OpenSSL API, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23048.\r\n\r\nI'm also planning on PR'ing a change to at least the `22.x` branch, to explicitly disable the OpenSSL based tests, via configure, given we aren't going to backport a subtree update.",
