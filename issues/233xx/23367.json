   "body" : "Requires #22019\r\n\r\nRemoving upper bound allows to find more changeless solutions. Most of them would be terrible due to huge excess and hence waste, so another solution would be chosen. But in some cases excess higher than upper bound would be\r\neconomically optimal based on waste metric.\r\n\r\nThis change also makes transaction building and waste calculation consistent. Specifically it eliminates two sources of discrepancy: \r\n\r\n1. for knapsack and SRD we used to always calculate waste as if they produce change (that's not always true)\r\n2. change could be dropped to fees during tx building after waste is calculated \r\n\r\nAs a result we should see more changeless solutions which is good for: privacy, utxo set, total fees paid.
