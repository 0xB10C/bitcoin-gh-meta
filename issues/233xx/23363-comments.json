This makes sure the source code is C++20 compatible, and perhaps use some C++20 features where possible. It could also be enabled for releases, *if* there is a significant benefit.\r\n\r\nI don't think we want to migrate to have the code _depend_ on C++20 features very soon, as self-compilation on non-cutting-edge systems should remain supported.",
