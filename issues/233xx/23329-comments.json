But it created a confusion (at least, I have such an impression), that the goal of such combined PR was _introducing_ a vcpkg binary caching. It is not the case. So I decided to leave #23215 solely on purpose of introducing of vcpkg downloads cache which has completely different goal in comparison to binary cache.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR is focused on an improvement of already used vcpkg binary caching feature.\r\n\r\nAnd #23215 will be focused on an introducing a new vcpkg downloads cache.",
