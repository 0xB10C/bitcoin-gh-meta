Worked intermittently but nothing interesting.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoind -shutdownnotify=\"bitcoind\"\r\n\r\nbitcoin-cli stop\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf getting notifications on start and shutdown is the goal maybe we should not provide easy option to execute shell commands with it. A file with name `notifications.dat` that saves such notifications should be enough IMO.",
