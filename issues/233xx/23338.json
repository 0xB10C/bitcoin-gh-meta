   "body" : "#23288 changed coinselector_tests to use `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan`, but it also ended up significantly slowing down the test, from 4 seconds to over 1 minute. It appears that the source of this slow down is with `CWallet::AddToWallet`, and primarily due to writing data to the mock wallet database. Because the only thing that is actually needed is for the created transaction to be placed into `CWallet::mapWallet`, this PR removes the call to `AddToWallet` and just places the transaction into `mapWallet` directly. This reduces the test time to 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nTo speed things up further, `CreateMockWalletDatabase` is changed to make a `SQLiteDatabase` instead of a `BerkeleyDatabase`. This is safe because there are no tests that require a specific mock database type.",
