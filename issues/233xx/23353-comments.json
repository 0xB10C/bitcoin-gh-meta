However I was able to trigger the assertion while running coin selection simulations, albeit after thousands of transactions and with some weird feerates.\r\n\r\nIn all of the cases the transactions that were successfully resubmitted had exactly 0 change outputs (I can say that especially about the one case that resulted in `AddToWallet(TX redacted) update` entry in debug.log). I am also always calling estimatesmartfee and settxfee right before sendmany.",
