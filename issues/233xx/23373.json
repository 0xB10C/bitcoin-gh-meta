   "body" : "Previously command line arguments passed to unit and fuzz tests would be ignored by the tests themselves. They would be used by the boost test framework (e.g. `--run_test=\"addrman_tests/*\"`) or by the fuzzer (e.g. `-runs=1`). However both provide ways to pass down the extra arguments to the test itself. Use that, parse the arguments and make them available to the tests via `gArgs`.\r\n\r\nThis makes the tests more flexible as they can be run with any bitcoind config option specified on the command line.\r\n\r\nWhen creating `AddrMan` objects in tests, use `-checkaddrman=` (if provided) instead of hardcoding the check ratio in many different places. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20233#issuecomment-889813074 for further motivation for this.",
