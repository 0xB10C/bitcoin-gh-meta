We can do better! :)",

The concern with REST (and also RPC, though RPC has additional exposure) is that it isn't designed to be DoS resistant, so it's assumed to only be exposed to clients that are trusted to not DoS attack the node. Putting in a Python wrapper that translates REST to RPC seems like that would only worsen this.",
