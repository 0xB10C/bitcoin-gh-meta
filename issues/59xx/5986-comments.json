      "body" : "You almost certainly do not have a miner running when using the Bitcoin GUI (unless you called the `setgenerate` RPC, or started with the `-gen` command-line option).\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core implements a full node, which validates all transactions on the network (including all of history, when it first runs). Likely the load on your system you are seeing is just due to work for this validation.\r\n\r\nIf you're not willing or not capable of running a full node due to the resources it requires, you can use different Bitcoin software with different security models.",
