One way around this would be to take an array for additional named arguments.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason that the locktime=N parameter of bitcoin-tx doesn't already accommodate this functionality? You can createrawtransaction then use bitcointx to set the locktime.   Though right now it doesn't set the sequence numbers but perhaps it should.",
