One way around this would be to take an array for additional named arguments.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason that the locktime=N parameter of bitcoin-tx doesn't already accommodate this functionality? You can createrawtransaction then use bitcointx to set the locktime.   Though right now it doesn't set the sequence numbers but perhaps it should.",

So weak NACK only.\r\n\r\n> For RPC tests i would recommend to fiddle with the hex-/byte-stream to change the lock_time's uint32_t. Isn't it always at the end of the serialized data?\r\n\r\nYes, I'd prefer to do it in the test code itself too. It's quite easy to manipulate a transaction from Python.\r\nSee e.g. https://gist.github.com/laanwj/12b984a838146acd9647 for some transaction and block surgery code I wrote for a test a while ago, but haven't got around to integrating.\r\n",
