Of course this is a necessary step in the process toward explicitly passing in a Consensus or ChainParams structure.\r\n\r\nThe part that generates most of the diff here is that which removes the getters and replaces them with `GetConsensus().x`. For the sake of reviewability, let's do this in a separate pull, with a large diff but apart from that 'almost-trivial'?\r\n\r\nAnd then do e.g. the GetBlockValue/GetBlockSubsidy change and other more significant changes on top of that, so that it's easier to see what happens.\r\n",
