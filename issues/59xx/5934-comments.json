      "body" : "I think this PR's implementation is not perfect and is not very modular. But it would give the opportunity to slowly decouple the wallet from the rest of the core.\r\nIt's unclear why we have a runtime linking of rpc commands and there are probably way better solutions of a dynamic handling of the rpc commands dispatching.\r\nBut these are out of the PRs focus.\r\n\r\nLongterm goals to achieve with this PR:\r\n* Remove/reduce wallet_enabled #ifdefs\r\n* Possibility to switch wallet implementation on compile and/or runtime (as startup/config arg)",
