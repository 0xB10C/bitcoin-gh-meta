Remember that there are various filtering steps that reduce the size of the list, for example to remove addresses already known, so starting off with 1000 entries may result in much less than 1000 being returned.\r\n",

      "body" : "@jonasschnelli Amended the commit to have a better message.\r\n@laanwj Thats true, `MAX_ADDR_TO_SEND` is better, however, I didn't want to introduce circular dependencies, or modify many files for this first minimal patch, before I didn't hear from the developers. `MAX_ADDR_TO_SEND` can't be used in addrman.h/.cpp, while `ADDRMAN_GETADDR_MAX` is available in net.h, if we include addrman.h in it (instead of net.cpp).\r\nOn less than 1000 addresses being returned: the same can be true for 2500...\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is an other problem in the filtering I discovered: When nodes announce their `addr` for the first time, don't get elected trickle node, and then want to answer a `getaddr`-message, couldn't it happen, that their queued `addr`-message gets overwritten and therefore never gets flooded?",
