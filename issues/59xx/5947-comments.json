I think the purpose of the code is clearer doing the calculations here, and it is easier to update if \"we\" decide that 4 hours or 1-false-positive-in-50-years either need to change or need to become command-line params.\r\n\r\n@sipa volunteered in IRC to write a little scheduler to avoid the VM overhead of another boost::thread, this will be rebased if that happens.\r\n",
