Therefore I prefer to do it in a way that I think is right rather than in the fastest way possible.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't \"change the way fees are computed\": fees are computed outside of this function. The only difference is that the subsidy and the fees were added together inside the function and now they will be added outside it. If the previous function had a more descriptive declaration like ```Camount CalculateSubsidyAndAddPreviouslyCalculatedFeesToIt(nHeight, previouslyCalucaletedFees)``` I doubt anybody would have complained about replacing ```CalculateSubsidyAndAddPreviouslyCalculatedFeesToIt(nHeight, nFees)``` with ```GetSubsidy(nHeight) + nFees```, which is far more readable IMO (and more aligned with general principles about reusability, but let's not go there).\r\n\r\nCalculating the initial subsidy to then ignore when halvings >= 64 it's stupid, so I would have also felt bad if I had touched this function without fixing that. I can always remove that tiny optimization if people insist on keep doing the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should have done this in 3 commits and only squash them after people have seen this as the obviously equivalent-but-clearer thing I see. If someone else wants to do a version without the optimization and keeping the addition inside the function (because somehow they thing ```, nFees)``` is clearer than ```+ nFees```), I'm totally fine with it. But it will change exactly 2 lines less (the 2 lines required for the micro-optimization, that is, moving ```CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;``` after ``````if halvings >= 64```).\r\nIf the creator of the competitor PR likes the micro-optimization but still wants to do the addition inside the function, the new PR will change exactly the same lines.\r\nBut I'm sorry, I'm not proposing that alternative myself because I don't like it, my change is free diff-wise and I consider rejecting that change another form of \"DoS against development\" that IMO makes less sense than asking people to order includes alphabetically (which at least has some minimal advantages rather than minimal disadvantages). \r\n",
