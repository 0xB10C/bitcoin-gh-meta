Probably a dataset with pairs height -> subsidy would be better.\r\n\r\nWe could also test for other subsidy halving intervals (now that Consensus::Params it's passed, it's trivial to set another Consensus::Params::nSubsidyHalvingInterval in the tests, even without calling Params()).\r\nDoes that sound good enough? Suggestions for improving main_tests (sat some point they should be renamed subsidy_tests and moved to src/consensus/tests but not yet)?\r\n",
