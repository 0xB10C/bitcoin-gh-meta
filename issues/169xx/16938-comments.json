One could use sipas crawler and use djbdns or bind or whatever to server the collected ips.\r\n\r\nIMO the server part has more risks for critical vulnerabilities, therefore reusing existing software for that part would be nice, although unclear if existing dns server implementations have the required flexibility to serve dynamic data.\r\n\r\nUnsure about the seeder from the Grin project. I couldn't find crawling code at all (maybe I overlooked it).",
