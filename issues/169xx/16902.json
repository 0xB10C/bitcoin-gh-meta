   "body" : "While investigating what mechanisms are possible to maximize the per-opcode verification cost of scripts, I noticed that the logic for determining whether a particular opcode is to be executed is O(n) in the nesting depth.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem currently, because even with a nesting depth of 100 (the maximum possible right now due to the 201 ops limit), the slowdown caused by this on my machine is around 70 ns per opcode (or 0.25 s per block) at worst, far lower than what is possible with other opcodes.\r\n\r\nThis PR mostly serves as a proof of concept that it's possible to avoid it, which may be relevant in discussions around increasing the opcode limits in future script versions (something I plan to bring up on the mailing list). Without it, the execution time of scripts can grow quadratically with the nesting depth, which very quickly becomes unreasonable.\r\n\r\nIn case it is interesting as a code simplification as-is, here it is. I don't think it meets the review overhead / benefit bar for consensus code.",
