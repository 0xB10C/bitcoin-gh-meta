Draft / compose: enter recipient, amount, fees, etc. (the current Send screen).\r\n\r\nThis step is skipped when loading a PSBT (e.g. via menu: Transaction -> Load, or a smart clipboard).\r\n\r\n2. Sign: currently a popup which confirms the details. With hardware wallets (e.g. #16549) this should enumerate connected wallets and let you sign one by one. In a multisig situation it should detect if any signatures are missing, and rename the 3rd step to \"Export\".\r\n\r\n3. Finish / Export: once again repeat the importantant details. For basic wallets with private keys in it, this should just show that the transaction has been broadcast. With a completed PSBT it should let the user choose between broadcasting or exporting (clipboard, save to disk).",
