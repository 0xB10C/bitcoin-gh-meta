If you rebase on top of this, you can probably drop the \"Enable offline transaction features\" checkbox as well as the \"include watchonly coins\" and \"create unsigned \"checkboxes, in favor of only allowing the functionality with watch-only wallets.\r\n\r\nI like how the send button text changes, so I'll steal that for this PR :-)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"898\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-09-24 om 13 49 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65509165-219dd100-ded2-11e9-8a3e-c6c9c93dc371.png\">\r\n\r\nOnce we have descriptor wallets and better HWI integration, the simple distinction between watch-only and wallets with private keys will no longer work. For example you might be part of a 2 of 3 multisig, with the keys in the wallet. Or maybe you don't have keys in the Core wallet, but your hardware wallet can sign its part via USB.\r\n\r\nSo in terms of your wizard, I would split into two wizards: one for composing & exporting, and one for loading.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"910\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-09-24 om 14 09 54\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65511729-1b125800-ded8-11e9-9a77-510e0902fcef.png\">\r\n\r\nThere's probably a step 0 where you attempt to (partially) sign with your own keys and with any connected devices. If that's not enough, then you go to step 1 where you can export the PSBT via clipboard or file system.\r\n\r\nI would introduce a fresh dialog for loading, maybe co-signing and then broadcasting a transaction.
