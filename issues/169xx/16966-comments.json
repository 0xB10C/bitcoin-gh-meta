      "body" : "I went back and for myself on the view style and ultimately did settle on a tab view. Ultimately there's never actually a need to press the Back and Next buttons unless you're doing something wrong (or a trivial demo) -- each step of the process will happen on a different machine.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of a \"load PSBT\" menu item taking you to the right tab. In my implementation, there is an \"offline\" menu from which you have to select \"sign\" or \"broadcast\" to open the dialog to the right tab; then you load from there.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of stuff that came up in the process of implementing this which I don't know if you've run into yet. For example, the signing wallet may not be able to put up the usual form of the confirmation display, as shown here, unless it has some trustworthy way to know which output is change, which it doesn't except maybe if you're using descriptors to tell it so.\r\n\r\nJumping back to Draft, much like having back/next buttons, is probably mostly not going to get used in real life, where the signing is happening on a different machine from the drafting. Honestly I think the main reason to have the steps of this flow be one dialog are to help the user have a sense of their place in the process, even though I expect probably they will be mostly used separately and on separate machines.",
