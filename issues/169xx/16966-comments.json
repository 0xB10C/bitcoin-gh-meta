Ultimately there's never actually a need to press the Back and Next buttons unless you're doing something wrong (or a trivial demo) -- each step of the process will happen on a different machine.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of a \"load PSBT\" menu item taking you to the right tab. In my implementation, there is an \"offline\" menu from which you have to select \"sign\" or \"broadcast\" to open the dialog to the right tab; then you load from there.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of stuff that came up in the process of implementing this which I don't know if you've run into yet. For example, the signing wallet may not be able to put up the usual form of the confirmation display, as shown here, unless it has some trustworthy way to know which output is change, which it doesn't except maybe if you're using descriptors to tell it so.\r\n\r\nJumping back to Draft, much like having back/next buttons, is probably mostly not going to get used in real life, where the signing is happening on a different machine from the drafting. Honestly I think the main reason to have the steps of this flow be one dialog are to help the user have a sense of their place in the process, even though I expect probably they will be mostly used separately and on separate machines.",

But perhaps that's better for a followup.\r\n\r\nRe tab view: I briefly looked at [QWizard](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-dialogs-classwizard-example.html) but that doesn't give the user an overview of where they are in the flow. The good news is that [QTabWidget](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtabwidget.html) can easily be swapped with [QStackedWidget](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstackedwidget.html) which can be completely customized, e.g. into something like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"247\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-09-26 om 10 37 33\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/65672650-ab23df00-e049-11e9-9c31-beabfacedfa1.png\">\r\n\r\nI'll probably disable the other tabs, so that all \"navigation\" happens through the buttons at the bottom of the screen.  \r\n\r\n> I expect probably they will be mostly used separately and on separate machines\r\n\r\nI'm thinking more of the hardware wallet use case. In the simplest configuration of 1 hardware wallet that's physically connected, the Sign tab is a nice place to show it. In case of something like ColdCard or the new BitBox this is where you would save the unsigned PSBT to SD drive.   ",
