      "body" : "Running `bitcoind --reindex` causes the client to reread the `.bitcoin/blocks/blknnnnn.dat` files and re-derive all the index and chainstate information. It's similar to IBD but the client uses these local files rather than download blocks from the network. As `LoadExternalBlockFile()` reads each block from disk, it checks to see if its parent has already been seen (and processed). If so, then this block can be immediately processed (by giving it to `AcceptBlock()`). If this block's parent hasn't yet been seen, it cannot be processed until after its parent is seen. Its prev-hash (parent's hash) is put into a map of \"pending\" blocks (called `mapBlocksUnknownParent`). Later, when its parent is encountered and processed, this map is consulted to see it has a child that's already been seen that can now be processed. If so, `LoadExternalBlockFile()` now has to go back and re-read the child block from disk (`ReadBlockFromDisk()`), deserialize it again, and then process (pass it to `AcceptBlock()`).\r\n\r\nPerformance isn't very good because about 90% of blocks are read before their parents are read. (I think this is a result of the headers-first IBD performance enhancement of a few years ago.) This can be seen by running `bitcoind --reindex --debug=reindex`, causing many messages like:\r\n```\r\n2019-09-29T00:29:00Z LoadExternalBlockFile: Out of order block 00000000a2268fb2d4ddc0408fae961a96668db58de415d3c9e0a7694eeb1657, parent 000000005fb53da5c3cda78aef28cbc44fde3e435f1dc2ac04df53387049171f not known\r\n```\r\nthen, a short time later:\r\n```\r\n2019-09-29T00:29:00Z LoadExternalBlockFile: Processing out of order child 00000000a2268fb2d4ddc0408fae961a96668db58de415d3c9e0a7694eeb1657 of 000000005fb53da5c3cda78aef28cbc44fde3e435f1dc2ac04df53387049171f\r\n```\r\nSo 90% of blocks end up being read from disk twice (actually, not twice, since the operating system's buffer cache likely still has the data, but there is still a memory-to-memory copy), and deserialized twice.\r\n\r\nThis PR mitigates this problem by taking advantage of the fact that recent blocks are still in the buffer (`blkdat`) that is used to read from the `blk` files. Since rewinding to an earlier offset in the buffer has been fixed by the recently merged #16577, we can see if the child block is still in memory (the probability is increased by making the buffer somewhat larger), and if so, avoid having to read the child block data from disk. It turns out that the child block is still in the buffer 60% of the time. This depends on some randomness that's introduced during IBD, so it may be different for you. (My IBD was done using all the default settings, nothing special.)\r\n\r\nThe second part of this change initially deserializes only the block header, rather than the entire block. since about 90% of the time we're going to have to process this block later; only the `hashPrevBlock` field of the header is needed to determine if we can process this block immediately (if this block's parent has been seen). This does mean that 10% of the time, we deserialize the header, and then immediately also the full block (where it would have been more efficient to simply deserialize the full block), but overall this is a big performance win.\r\n\r\nOn my system, this PR reduces the time to `--reindex` on mainnet by 48 minutes. I encourage reviewers to attempt to replicate my findings. Reindexing has two parts, reading the `blocks/blknnnnn.dat` files (which this PR improves), and then connecting the blocks to the blockchain (the `UpdateTip` messages), which this PR doesn't affect. For me, this PR reduces the first part from 123 to 75 minutes. After you start seeing `UpdateTip` messages, you can stop the client, and you will have the time measurement you need from `debug.log`.",

During the first phase, memory (`VSZ` in the ps output) is about 2.4 gb on my system; afterwards (when it's logging `UpdateTip: new best...`), it's about 3.5 gb. The benefit of a large buffer is that a larger fraction of the out-of-order blocks (that have to be processed later, when their parents are seen) can be found in memory, rather than having to read them again from disk. The \"hit ratio\" with this buffer size is just under 99%. The difference between 160 (but overall buffer size in max-blocks)) and 140 (the rewind limit) determines the size of disk reads (the larger, the better, more efficient).",

      "body" : "@mzumsande, those are very good thoughts, thank you. I will study this further (and invite others to also). One nice thing about this design is that any amount of memory will work, in that it will be an improvement -- it is one of those classic space-time tradeoffs. The idea of making the buffer not have a hard-coded size is intriguing and promising. I think we would not go back to the pre-second iteration (multiple-files), because even reducing the buffer memory to the original amount would be improved by the multi-file version. (That is to say, there is no downside to the latest version here.) That's because all the multi-file commit means is that we do not discard cached data when switching files.\r\n\r\nOne thing I hope I made clear enough in an earlier comment is that I tried to keep the memory usage during reindexing be strictly _less_ than what is needed during normal operation, so that there would be no overall increase in memory demand. We certainly would not want this design to create a *spike* (high water mark) of memory usage. But I was very likely mistaken, since I was not aware that memory could be \"dialed down\" for small environments.",

      "body" : "I force-pushed a reorganization of the commits to make reviewing easier. I split the largest commit, **speed up reindex by reading out-of-order blocks from memory**, into two separate commits:\r\n1. Commit message: **initially deserialize only CBlockHeader, not CBlock**. Deserialize only a block header (only 32 bytes) initially, instead of a full block. The block header is all that's needed to tell us if this block's parent has been seen yet; if not, the block will have to be deserialized later, after its parent is found. Nearly all blocks (89% on my system) are seen before their parents, so this is a big improvement.\r\n1. Commit message: **speed up reindex by reading out-of-order blocks from memory**. If we've just processed a block that's the parent of an earlier-seen block, we must now process that earlier block. Instead of always reading that block from disk, see if it happens to still be in the circular disk read memory buffer ('CBufferedFile blkdat`). This saves a disk read.\r\n\r\nWe could merge the first commit without the second. The first commit is pretty simple; the second commit is a little more involved.\r\n\r\nThese two commits have a buffer size unchanged from master, 8mb (`2*MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE`), so there is no change in memory usage. But with this buffer size, only 29% of the out-of-order blocks are found in the buffer. If we increase the buffer by not too much (as I did in an earlier commit that's now been erased by force-push, 640mb), to 32mb, the \"hit rate\" increases to 50%. This is probably a good space-time balance.\r\n\r\nHere are the block-load times on my system (with all default settings), which is just the first part of reindexing (each row builds on the previous row):\r\n\r\n| version | real time (minutes) |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| master | 130 |\r\n| deserialize only header | 90 |\r\n| look for blocks in buffer, 8mb |84 |\r\n| look for blocks in buffer, 32mb |78 |\r\n| look for blocks in buffer, 640mb |72 |\r\n\r\n(Take with a grain of salt, because the times varied even on identical runs, and a lot probably depends on the specifics of my system.) Keep in mind that this buffer exists only during the block-load part of reindex.",
