Don't see how you could make receiver-initiator work without p2p changes though.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like we could get the simplest case (one tx doing CPFP for one or more others, but no grandparents, and immediately getting them all into the top 2 or 3 MB of mempool) without p2p changes, just by noticing you don't have the parents, requesting them, and handling the new tx and any requested parents as a package. Might be a good phase 1.",
