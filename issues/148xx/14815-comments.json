      "body" : "For all new RPCs, use `string` as the type, with mandatory units? (`100 sats|satoshis`, or `100 btc|bitcoin`). Allows for flexible input and a clear interface. It could be an upgrade to several RPCs at once.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `rpcunits` could be an enum / string, configurable in both bitcoin.conf and in amount-using RPC calls, with an unset default. So in this case, `totalFee` and `totalFeeUnits` (optional) would both exist in `bumpfee`. This would keep `totalFee` as `numeric`, while offering the same input flexibility and defensive approach.",
