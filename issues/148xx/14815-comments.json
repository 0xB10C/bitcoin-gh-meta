It could be an upgrade to several RPCs at once.\r\n\r\n~Alternatively, `rpcunits` could be an enum / string, configurable in both bitcoin.conf and in amount-using RPC calls, with an unset default. So in this case, `totalFee` and `totalFeeUnits` (optional) would both exist in `bumpfee`. This would keep `totalFee` as `numeric`, while offering the same input flexibility and defensive approach.~",

The only exceptions to this are\r\n    `prioritisetransaction` and `getblocktemplate` because their interface\r\n    is specified as-is in BIP22.\r\n```",
