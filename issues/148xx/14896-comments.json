As if I need to spend more than Z coins, I would consider that my wallet needs defraging before I make the payment.\r\n\r\nSo I could emulate that by using `-maxtxfee`, but I run into two problems: Firstly it does not support dynamic adjustment which is essential when fee rates change. And the more pressing problem is that correct me if I'm wrong) the coin selection in unaware of it. So with an aggressive maxfee it will frequently create a coin selection that exceeds the `-maxtxfee`, and then in the final stage core will reject it for exceeding the `maxtxfee`.\r\n\r\nIf the coin selection itself was aware of the maxtxfee constraint, it could make a good effort at avoiding trying to create solutions that would violate it and instead say focus on larger inputs. \r\n\r\n  ",
