The fallback choice, `wget`, has a default 20 retries.\r\n\r\nI chose 5 retries because `curl` backs of after each try, starting at one second and doubling each time. 5 retries means that worst case scenario would be a total of 31 seconds waiting between attempts. IMO that should be enough tries if internet is working, but not too much if internet is not working.",
