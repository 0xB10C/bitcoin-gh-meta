   "body" : "Suggesting that bitcoind be able to bind to multiple anonymous (and regular) networks at once.\nInbound queries would reply out the same bind they were received on.\nOutbound initiates/broadcasts might be sent from all binds, or if impossible or out of context, to a specified one.\nGoal: Allow one daemon to service all networks [1] at once.\n[1] IPv4, IPv6, Tor, I2P, Phantom\n\nNote it should always be made possible option to not bind to '*' (all addresses),\nbut only to ones supplied.\n\nI'm not certain if -externalip can do this. -discover in doc/Tor.txt says:\n'If you want to run a dual stack, reachable from both Tor and IPv4 (or IPv6), you'll need to either pass your other addresses using -externalip'\nwhich implies maybe it can, but offers no syntax. Maybe it is a doc bug.\n\n-externalip=foo.onion (or Tor's OnionCat IPv6 /48)\n-externalip=bar.i2p (or I2P's GarliCat IPv6 /48)\n-externalip=6addr (.phantom / interpreted from its IPv6 /48 prefix)\n-externalip=6addr\n-externalip=4addr\n\nAlso, since socks context via -proxy breaks down with more than one such anonymous net, there would also need to be:\n-tor=host:port (in Tor, in bitcoin)\n-i2p=host:port (in I2P, not in bitcoin)\n-phantom=host:port (not in Phantom, not in bitcoin)\nand maybe\n-proxyipv4=host:port\n-proxyipv6=host:port\n",
