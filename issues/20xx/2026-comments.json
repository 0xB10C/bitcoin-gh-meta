PPC is not\n+supported because it is big-endian.\n+\n+All of the commands should be executed in a Terminal application. The\n+built-in one is located in `/Applications/Utilities`.\n+\n+Preparation\n+-----------\n+\n+You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler\n+and everything is available in /usr not just /Developer. XCode should be\n+available on your OS Xinstallation media, but if not, you can get the\n+current version from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/. If you install\n+Xcode 4.3 or later, you'll need to install its command line tools. This can\n+be done in `Xcode > Preferences > Downloads > Components` and generally must\n+be re-done or updated every time Xcode is updated.\n+\n+There's an assumption that you already have `git` installed, as well. If\n+not, it's the path of least resistance to install Github for Mac\n+(OS X 10.7+) or\n+[Git for OS X](https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/).\n+\n+You will also need to install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)\n+or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) in order to install library\n+dependencies. It's largely a religious decision which to choose, but, as of\n+November 2012, MacPorts is a little easier because you can just install the\n+dependencies immediately - no other work required. If you're unsure, read\n+the instructions through first in order to assess what you want to do.\n+Homebrew is a little more popular among those newer to OS X.\n+\n+The installation of the actual dependencies is covered in the Instructions\n+section below.\n+\n+If you are on OS X 10.7+ and choose MacPorts, you'll need to edit\n+`/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf` and uncomment \"build_arch i386\".\n+\n+Instructions\n+------------\n+\n+### Install dependencies\n+\n+#### Install dependencies using MacPorts\n+\n+Installing the dependencies using MacPorts is very straightforward.\n+\n+    sudo port install boost db48 openssl miniupnpc\n+\n+Optionally install `qrencode` (and set USE_QRCODE=1):\n+\n+    sudo port install qrencode\n+\n+#### Install dependencies using Homebrew\n+\n+Installation the libraries using Homebrew takes a little more work because\n+we have to revert one of the installation formulas to an older version.

      "body" : "Homebrew doesn't link openssl like it does other packages because [\"The OpenSSL provided by OS X is too old for some software.\"](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/openssl.rb#L9) It installs in \"keg-only\" mode, and has to be manually linked only if required:\r\n\r\n> **What does keg-only mean?** It means the formula is installed only into the Cellar, it is not linked into `/usr/local`. This means most tools will not find it. We donÃ¢ÂÂt do this for stupid reasons. You can link the formula in still if you need to with `brew link`. - [Homebrew FAQ](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/FAQ)\r\n\r\nI interpret this to mean that if we rely on openssl to be linked already or include an instruction to link it, things may break. I'd rather not see Bitcoin as the cause of a broken dev system because a newer version of openssl is causing problems for Apple's stuff.\r\n\r\nOne can get the path to Homebrew's installation of openssl with `brew --prefix openssl`. However, it appears that the current makefile.osx doesn't account for the possibility of multiple hierarchies to get the `include` and `lib` for all necessary libraries. It relies on [`DEPSDIR`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/makefile.osx#L10) to set [`INCLUDEPATHS`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/makefile.osx#L12) and `LIBPATHS`. \r\n\r\nThis also exacerbates static building, because it, too, relies on `DEPSDIR` and everything being in the same hierarchy. Maybe static compilation as coded is not so much a problem if the releaser is always using MacPorts.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'd rather not see a separate makefile.osx just for Homebrew folk. The patch does *just enough* to make it work for now. I could further improve the patch and the instructions to allow passing of `brew --prefix openssl` at compilation time in order to eliminate the possibility of an openssl version bump messing up the paths added in the patch.\r\n\r\nIf we* could alter `makefile.osx` to better account for the differences between Homebrew and MacPorts, and do so dynamically, we could remove the need for the patch *and* remove the need for a separate path of instructions for each packaging system. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have access to a system with MacPorts installed and I'm hesitant to introduce it onto mine for fear of messing up my own environment for other things ;-)\r\n\r\nIf what's here now in this pull request is *good enough* for 0.8, I'll split the HOWTO into sections as suggested and squash these commits somehow (is there a way to do that without having to delete and recreate the branch? I've only had to squash once and just ended up doing that and resubmitting a PR) and get them ready. Otherwise, perhaps a `makefile.osx` modification is in order for 0.9.\r\n\r\n*we = someone involved in the project with perhaps stronger Makefile kung-foo than I",
