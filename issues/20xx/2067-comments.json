First, addresses are either in the address book or receive coin list, secondly, there are safeguards at multiple levels that prevent receive addresses from being deleted.\r\n\r\nCan you give steps on how to accomplish this? How do you get receiving address in your address book in the first place?\r\n\r\n",
