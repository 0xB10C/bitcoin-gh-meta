   "body" : "The aim of this PR is to improve the ability to monitor soft fork status. It first moves the softfork section from getblockchaininfo into a new RPC named getforkinfo, which is then also able to query the status of forks at an arbitrary block rather than only at the tip. In addition, bip9 status is changed to indicate the status of the given block, rather than just for the next block, and an additional field is included to indicate whether each block in the signalling period signaled.",
