   "body" : "Heavily inspired by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23077 which adds CJDNS support\r\n\r\n# Yggdrasil overview \r\n\r\nYggdrasil is an implementation of a new name-independent routing scheme and functions as an end-to-end encrypted IPv6 network. It shares very similar goals to CJDNS. It uses an address range of `0200::/8` (as opposed to `fc00::/8` used by CJDNS).\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nDespite Yggdrasil is being considered an alpha quality software, it seems to be much more maintained than CJDNS. It is also much easier to get it working on less common systems and architectures because it is written in pure Go.\r\n\r\n# Yggdrasil resources\r\n\r\n* homepage: https://yggdrasil-network.github.io\r\n* more about Yggdrasil history: https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/2019/01/09/history.html\r\n* FAQ: https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/faq.html\r\n* source code: https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go\r\n* releases: https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/releases\r\n\r\n# For testing\r\n\r\n```\r\n[201:207b:fda6:a1a5:8be:8d73:aa63:104b]:8333\r\n```",
