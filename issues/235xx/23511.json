   "body" : "This increases our runtime glibc requirement from 2.17 to 2.18. From what I can see the only platform this drops release support for is CentOS 7, which reached the end of it's \"full update\" support at the [end of 2020](https://wiki.centos.org/About/Product). It does receive maintenance updates until 2024, however I don't think supporting glibc 2.17 until 2024 is realistic. \r\n\r\nIt was mentioned in #22405 that our 2.17 requirement could be a bit excessive, and I tend to agree, however without a good reason to require an even newer version, I think a move from 2.17 -> 2.18 is sufficient for now. That means we get a glibc with \"proper\" support for `thread_local` (see below), as well as avoid having to patch dependencies to retain glibc compatibility (see #23489).\r\n\r\nNote that anyone wanting to self-compile and target a glibc 2.17 runtime could currently build with `--disable-threadlocal`. However we wouldn't make any guarantees on how long that workaround might exist for.\r\n\r\nglibc 2.18 was released in August 2013: https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2013-08/msg00160.html.\r\n> Add support for calling C++11 thread_local object destructors on thread\r\n  and program exit.  This needs compiler support for offloading C++11\r\n  destructor calls to glibc.\r\n\r\nThe last time we increased our runtime glibc requirement for release builds was in #17538 (0.20 release), where we moved from a 2.11 requirement to 2.17.\r\n\r\nGuix builds:\r\n```bash\r\n\r\n```",
