   "body" : "Now that taproot is active, it can be treated as if it was always active for policy for the next major release. This simplifies the code and changes two things:\r\n\r\n* Importing `tr` descriptors can be done before the chain is fully synced. This is fine, because the wallet will already generate `tr` descriptors by default (regardless of the taproot status) after #22364.\r\n* Valid taproot spends won't be rejected from the mempool before taproot is active. This is strictly speaking a bugfix after #22364, since the wallet may generate taproot spends before the chain is fully synced. For example, a slow node or a purposefully offline node. Currently, the wallet needs the mempool to account for change. See #11887.\r\n\r\nA similar change was done for segwit v0 in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13120 \r\n\r\n",
