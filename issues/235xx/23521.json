   "body" : "The helper `create_block` offers two parameters `version` and `txlist` which set the `nVersion` field / extend the `vtx` array of the block, respectively. By taking use of those, we can remove a lot of code, including the recalculation of the merkle root. Both passing txs in string and `CTransaction` format is supported, i.e. we also save potential calls to `tx_from_hex`.\r\nThe PR also contains another commit which replaces magic numbers for OP_TRUE/OP_1 (0x51) with the proper constant from the `script` module.",
