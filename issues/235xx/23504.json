Avoid this by hopping to the next LTS release 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).\r\n\r\nWhile the release is currently in development, it seems unlikely that anything will break for us. I am doing the hirsute->jammy hop to avoid a hirsute->impish->jammy hop, but if anything does break, we can fall back to that \"double hop\".",
