We could do that with or without treating it as a separate network:\r\n* With a separate network, as this PR currently does, it's a somewhat cleaner separation, we get somewhat better failures (non-Yggdrasil-connected nodes would not even bother trying to connect, rather than trying and failing), and if we ever get a network extension to negotiate supported networks, also somewhat better gossip (by preferential relay among compatible nodes). The downside is that it requires a BIP or BIP addendum to reserve a BIP155 network id.\r\n* Without a separate network, it's a smaller change, and we'd implement the group mapping directly on the 0200::/8 range in IPv6, essentially hardcoding the knowledge that that range belongs to Yggdrasil.\r\n\r\nI have a slight preference for the first approach.",

But I think the discussion is a bit more nuanced than just looking at that.\r\n\r\nThe name of this PR is a bit misleading, for starters. This isn't adding support for yggdrasil to Bitcoin Core in the sense of having the project depend on it, or add direct integration (as was the case for tor and i2p, where significant amount of special code were needed to let Bitcoin Core interact with the specific routing software for those networks). What it does add is a small amount of code to make Bitcoin Core's network stack *aware* of the fact that a particular subrange of the IPv6 space corresponds to Yggdrasil, and should be treated slightly differently. Interacting with the Yggdrasil network is done independently, by the user installing an Yggdrasil router, which integrates in the OS, and transparently routes yggdrasil-compliant IP addresses over the Yggdrasil network - and this happens (and can be used) whether or not Bitcoin Core has specific support for it.\r\n\r\nThe advantages are:\r\n* Better behavior in case *anyone* starts rumouring such addresses on the network, regardless of whether the node's operator considers them using Yggdrasil to be a good idea or not.\r\n* Better behavior for anyone actually using Yggdrasil. I personally think that more distinct ways to connect nodes in general is a good thing, as it contributes to partition resistance of the network.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages are:\r\n* Extra code to maintain, obviously.\r\n* Connectivity issues in case there are problems/upgrades with yggdrasil, for those using it.\r\n\r\nI think both of the disadvantages are actually tiny. The amount of code being added here is similar to what is needed for cjdns; just making the network stack aware of the existence of this separate range. Connectivity issues could be problem in case someone is exclusively connecting through yggdrasil, but I don't think anyone is arguing for that (or should; just like you shouldn't exclusively use automatic tor or i2p connections). If yggdrasil goes down (either due to a network-wide failure, or incompatible upgrades, or individual routers crashing)... bitcoin core will make new connections; interrupted connections are nothing special. Given that Bitcoin Core is in no way directly talking to the yggdrasil router, I'm not worried about it causing bugs/crashes in Bitcoin Core itself.",

      "body" : "Hey everyone, **I would not recommend adding Yggdrasil support**, not on the basis of principle, but on the basis of the nature of the project itself, let me explain.\r\n\r\nYggdrasil is largely an experimental academic protocol/software, aimed to research routing at scale, the intention (of its author @Arceliar) is to - eventually - wrap it up, place a v1 on it, and write a paper, but there is sofar no intention to keep up support after that.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, there is also no guarantees of minor version incompatibility, so this could be quite unstable to use.\r\n\r\nInstead, i would like to direct everyone's attention to a spin-off project, [pinecone](https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/), made with the same current routing methods, but intended to be supported for a long time. Pinecone also doesn't work via ipv6 addresses, but full public key hashes, and is intended to be embeddable.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Bitcoin is a large project on the internet with many eyes on it, i would heavily recommend getting into dialogue with Pinecone's developers before proceeding with adding support.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Yggdrasil is experimental and academic, while a project derivative of it, Pinecone, is aiming to be actively developed in the future.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are some caveats to my recommendation, the first one is the idea that yggdrasil wont be developed anymore after the paper has been written and published, that's an assumption, if anyone else (or bitcoin) could maybe like to pick up development after it's hit v1, then obviously this could be a good addition, but it depends on what it's authors think of the future, so i recommend conversing about that before adding this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMost of my knowledge here comes from talking with the actual Yggdrasil devs, if anyone would like to ask for themselves, they can do so via the [matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#yggdrasil:matrix.org).
