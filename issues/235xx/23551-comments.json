My reading of boost's `build.sh` as of 1.71.0 seems to indicate that the `--cxx` and `--cxxflags` would be ignored: https://github.com/boostorg/build/blob/04efaac148671479b514db882b1c520dcaafe89e/src/engine/build.sh#L149-L155\r\n\r\nSo perhaps there's a `CXX` env var that's set somewhere in depends that we don't know about?
