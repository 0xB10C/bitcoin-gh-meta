I am doing the hirsute->jammy hop to avoid a hirsute->impish->jammy hop, but if anything does break, we can fall back to that \"double hop\".\r\n\r\nOne more hop does not look too difficult to be done. Maybe avoid any concerns about using a non-final release in our CI, and just do a \"double hop\"?",
