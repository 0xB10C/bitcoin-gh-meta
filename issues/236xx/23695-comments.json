      "body" : "Concept ACK (to this change, not getting rid of AdjustedTime entirely)\r\n\r\nThe timestamp a node sends to their inbounds will influence their adjusted time, and I think it makes sense to use the local time for that - this also counteracts non-local phenomena, where a wrong Adjusted Time is passed from A to B, affects B's adjusted time and is passed along to B's future peers and so on.\r\n\r\n> I presume the reason is to avoid a fingerprint in case the local time is misconfigured.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to know for sure (this inbound/outbound distinction seems to be a Satoshi thing that was never touched). But it makes little sense to me, for the reasons stated above. It seems much more easy to do fingerprinting if you can influence the adjusted time of your target, than if you would have to hope that the peer's local time happens to be wrong in order to do anything.\r\nMaybe there is another reason?\r\n\r\n> The local time is off by more than 70 minutes. See DEFAULT_MAX_TIME_ADJUSTMENT. While there is a warning in this case, the warning might be missed by the node operator.\r\n\r\nAlso, according to the [logic here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/63c63b5533e8d1c682aae3ae6d35b76836ab8341/src/timedata.cpp#L81-L99) the warning not even always issued in this case - only if we have no timedata sample within 5 minutes of our local time. Otherwise, we'd silently go back to using local time.",
