Tried using `-0` in few other arguments for other RPC and it is considered as `0`. I could not find a way to read `peers.dat` however this observation is based on usage of negative zero in other parameters.~~\r\n\r\nBased on reading few posts like https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/280648/why-is-negative-zero-important it could be an issue in some cases ~~but not here I guess.I have no opinion on this because I couldn't do anything interesting with `-0` in `addpeeraddress`~~\r\n\r\n@amadeuszpawlik  I tried using port `-0` in `addnode` and it adds negative zero in the port, I am assuming similar thing would happen with `addpeeraddress` so: \r\n\r\n**Concept ACK** for this PR and maybe we need to make changes for few other RPC",

It looks like `-0` is not the only case that `addnode` accepts.\r\nThe modded `SplitHostPort` I propose in #22087 would definitely be nice here for port validation.\r\nI'll go trough other RPCs and add validation for them too.\r\n\r\nMy question still stands, is modifying `univalue` a valid approach for commands that currently use `int` for port value, or do I ignore the `-0` case and simply validate directly in `net.cpp`?",
