      "body" : "> Or should I rather validate port directly in addpeeraddress() and just ignore the -0 case?\r\n\r\nI think it can be ignored. Tried using `-0` in few other arguments for other RPC and it is considered as `0`. I could not find a way to read `peers.dat` however this observation is based on usage of negative zero in other parameters. \r\n\r\nBased on reading few posts like https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/280648/why-is-negative-zero-important it could be an issue in some cases but not here I guess. I have no opinion on this because I couldn't do anything interesting with `-0` in `addpeeraddress`",
