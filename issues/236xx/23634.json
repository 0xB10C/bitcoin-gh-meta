   "body" : "The scantxoutset RPC and its help text was at last improved in #16285, but it's still missing examples (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16285#issuecomment-529313781).\r\n\r\nNote that the example descriptor used doesn't follow the developer guideline of using invalid bech32 addresses, as the RPC is not wallet-related and it's use-case is merely to look up state information (i.e. there is no danger of sending funds to a wrong address). For the sake of simplicity, an early coinbase payout address (block 9) is taken, i.e. it yields results even at an early stage of IBD. Happy to change that though if there are other suggestions.",
