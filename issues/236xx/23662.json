   "body" : "The RPC calls `getreceivedbyaddress`/`getreceivedbylabel` both use the internal helper function `GetReceived` which was introduced in PR #17579 to deduplicate tallying code. For every wallet-related transaction output, the following unnecessary operations are currently performed in the tally loop:\r\n- converting from CScript -> TxDestination (`ExtractDestination(...)`), converting from TxDestination -> CScript (`CWallet::IsMine(const CTxDestination& dest)`); this can be avoided by directly using output scripts in the search set instead of addresses (first commit)\r\n- checking if the iterated output script belongs to the wallet by calling `IsMine`; this can be avoided by only adding addresses to the search set which fulfil `IsMine` in the first place (second commit)\r\n\r\nWhile the first commit is pretty straight-forward, the second commit is potentially more controversial, as it could actually hurt performance if users put a huge number of addresses under the same label. Not sure how that is used in production, I always assumed that there is a one-by-one label->address relation and having more than one address referred to by a label doesn't make too much sense.\r\n \r\nFor the `getreceivedbyaddress` case, I saw a massive speedup though (~10x), will try to put that benchmarks in a presentable form if the PR gets conceptual ACKs. Likely fixes #23645. ",
