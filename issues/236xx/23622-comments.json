      "body" : "This seems like a nice change. Few thoughts I had were\r\n\r\n- Maybe `rpc/coins` instead of `rpc/utxos` Or maybe not. I don't know which direction usage is shifting, but \"coins\" always seemed more friendly and comprehensible to me.\r\n- Maybe rename `rpcwallet` to `rpc/wallets` after all the moves, or split further into `rpc/general` `rpc/load`. In any case it would be nice to have _all_ wallet RPC methods in the `rpc/` directory.\r\n- Personally I think this would be nicest to do in one MOVEONLY PR that did not change any existing code. That way any conflicting PR will have to be rebased at most one time, instead of possibly multiple times.",
