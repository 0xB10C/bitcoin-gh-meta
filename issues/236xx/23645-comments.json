      "body" : "Concept ACK\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting! I think we definitely don't want users to avoid updating to new versions due to RPC calls performing significantly worse, i.e. I'd agree that this needs to be fixed (unless there is a really good reason not to). I vaguely remember having reviewed this PR at that time (more than two years ago), obviously neither me nor other reviewers were aware that this could affect the performance -- in a strict sense this PR should not have been labelled as \"refactoring\". Will take a deeper look within the next days.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue easier, would you mind sharing what is a \"big wallet\" in your use-case, in terms of order of magnitude of number of transactions/addresses in the wallet? Also do you have concrete numbers on taking \"notably longer\"?",
