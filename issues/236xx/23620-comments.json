Time locked mechanisms are in general a sign of something being developed incorrectly (although not always,  IE:  Bitcoin's mining algorithm to slow things down is a good example of when to use a time lock security method).  The bitcoind's walletpassphrase RPC call is one such animal.  It should be eliminated and replaced with pw arguments on functions that need to be behind a pw in an encrypted scenario.

Do you know what a time lock security method is and why they are used?  walletpassphrase unlocks your wallet for X amount of time and if you dont lock it again afterwards OR your process simply takes to long,  some other process can come along and hijack a now unlocked wallet.  There is a time and place for time locked security measures,  however accessing a wallet is not one of them.\r\n\r\nMaybe this analogy would be better.   Go unlock your phone and put it on the table in the middle of a busy prison.  How long do you think it will be before someone picks it up and starts poking around on it to see what they can find?  Here we have the same problem.  Unlocking a wallet for X amount of time.  Each function should instead ask for the pw rather than having 1 function that unlocks everything for X milliseconds.\r\n\r\nI do consider this a security vulnerability but it's a DESIGNED security vulnerability.  Thus I think it belongs in here as a feature,  not a security bug.  I have not heard a single good reason why a time lock mechanism was used so far.  Take coinomi for example,  does their wallet unlock for X amount of time?  No.  It asks for a pw on every function that should be protected.  Why do you think that is?",

You wanting to have that function does not make it so.\r\n\r\n> RPC has no way to lock SPECIFIC functions. That's not it's job.\r\n\r\nI'd say that's exactly the function of RPC passwords, only it's not implemented. What it sounds like to me is that you're asking for a way to prevent certain RPC clients from having restrictions on their access (e.g. no ability to send coins, or being restricted to certain wallets). There have been pull requests and ideas around that in the past, though none currently actively being developed.\r\n\r\nThere is no point in this function being carried by the encryption password, as that password would be shared across all RPC clients.",
