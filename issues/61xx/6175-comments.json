      "body" : "@luke-jr  It seems that u don't want to understand. Address reuse is not only issue for this case. This address https://blockchain.info/address/1Ks4usdNXE4Un97pYG5Aqrjx3tm88GVj9n was not reused and still the sender lost 1 Bitcoin. My idea is mitigate the damage made by the attack. Yes, Bitfinex can state, that any transfers made after announcement will not refunded. But Bitfinex cannot do this, because many transfers was made to addresses generated by the Bitfinex and user is not obliged to be always online. Bitfinex will have to refund this loss, so this still increases the damage.\r\n\r\nThe idea doesn't require any special change in the Bitcoin protocol. We can use OP_RETURN and put the blocking request after it. This idea will work only if majority of bitcoin users will accept it. \r\n\r\nI know, that there are some possible ways, how to abuse this feature - as someone pointed out that it can be used to block unconfirmed transactions. But there is already way to block unconfirmed transaction. Someone can try to double-spend the transaction with the same effect. It still doesn't render the idea invalid. We can just put this feature at the same level as double-spending and problem is solved.\r\n\r\nI just drew the idea. You should to improve the idea, not finding the difficulties to throw it away. Bitcoin needs lot of user-protecting features and this is one of them. Otherwise, it will not widely accepted by the public.",
