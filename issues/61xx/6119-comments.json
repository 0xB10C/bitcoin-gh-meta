I didn't notice any references to TheBlueMatt/bitcoinj, but perhaps I'm not looking in the right place.\r\n\r\n(As an aside, it also looks like `native_comparisontool.mk` is pointing to an empty ref (404 for me :/): https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/raw/38b490a2599d422b12d5ce8f165792f63fd8f54f , not sure if this is aggravating the buildbot issues or not, though.)\r\n\r\nMore to the point, if the builds are breaking, where would the fixes go, and are they valuable to update? (versus pushing that off or expanding @sdaftuar's testing framework, instead -* I think having accurate travis builds would provide lots of value)",

      "body" : "@faizkhan00 Travis uses that process for each build. It contains no state (other than a download cache) so if the url is bad, builds will eventually fail because they can't fetch it. The full url is download_path + file_name: https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/raw/38b490a2599d422b12d5ce8f165792f63fd8f54f/pull-tests-0f7b5d8.jar\r\n\r\nAs for fixing broken builds, the current tool is built from here: https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoinj/commits/0f7b5d89b5f70c0803d36e690b702b5050771381 . That commit doesn't appear in any public branches, it looks like it's been rebased into https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoinj/tree/blocktester. Notice that the package_version in native_comparisontool.mk points to the commit that the jar is built from.\r\n\r\nI suggested at one point that we build the jar from source rather than pulling down some random blob, but I was in the minority and I didn't push it. I'd still like to see it work that way, but at this point, it makes more sense to spend the effort get the python tool up to feature parity.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to take a stab at fixing, I suggest you checkout the code at 0f7b5d89b5f70c0803d36e690b702b5050771381, track down the issue, build a jar, then submit a PR to bump the version we pull. But again, I'm sure @sdaftuar could come up with a list of ways you could help out with the python framework instead.",
