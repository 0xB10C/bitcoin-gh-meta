See the recent python test framework from @sdaftuar which may be able to achieve that once it's filled out more.",

I didn't notice any references to TheBlueMatt/bitcoinj, but perhaps I'm not looking in the right place.\r\n\r\n(As an aside, it also looks like `native_comparisontool.mk` is pointing to an empty ref (404 for me :/): https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/raw/38b490a2599d422b12d5ce8f165792f63fd8f54f , not sure if this is aggravating the buildbot issues or not, though.)\r\n\r\nMore to the point, if the builds are breaking, where would the fixes go, and are they valuable to update? (versus pushing that off or expanding @sdaftuar's testing framework, instead -* I think having accurate travis builds would provide lots of value)",
