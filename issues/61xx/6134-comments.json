The slider just indicates the # of blocks for which your fee estimate was valid.  Perhaps we need to consider some kind of additional UI element that would explain to people why they aren't able to get an estimate for a smaller # of blocks.  I think it'll be very rare and maybe never that you'll successfully get an estimate for 1 block, which people will probably try to do.",
