The slider just indicates the # of blocks for which your fee estimate was valid.  Perhaps we need to consider some kind of additional UI element that would explain to people why they aren't able to get an estimate for a smaller # of blocks.  I think it'll be very rare and maybe never that you'll successfully get an estimate for 1 block, which people will probably try to do.",

I guess less then <1% of transactions aim for confirmation >=25blocks.\r\n\r\nQT: In my case (mainnet at current height), num-blocks 25 till 18 had the same fee. This feels bad for users, because they might think, \"why should I pay a higher fee than i really need for my target?\". We need to aggregate num-blocks with the same fee (stop at block 18, don't go further down with the fee, up with the num block target). Also num-blocks 10 and 11 had the same fee, these should be aggregated.\r\n\r\nThere should be something when calling `estimatefee 1`. I know that there are to many unknowns for a precise calculation. But it's an **estimation**. We should not return -1. We should return a value as accurate as possible with the parameters that are available (even is there are hight risks that the estimation is wrong).",

I might still expose estimateapproxfee, but for anyone using GUI or wallet code that automatically generates fee, they should now get the best answer possible.  I figured that for outside users, they could emulate the logic of estimateapproxfee themselves for now.  In the future I agree there should be an RPC call which just does the right thing, but I wasn't ready to expose that now as I'm not sure exactly what it should look like yet.",
