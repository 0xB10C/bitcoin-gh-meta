   "body" : "When automatically adding a fee estimate to a transaction and in the event no estimate is available for the desired confirmation target, it makes more sense to default to a fee estimate for a worse confirmation target rather than the hard coded minimum.\r\n\r\nI'm open to a different way of exposing this functionality if there is a better suggestion.\r\n\r\n@cozz I don't know anything about QT code, so I think what I did in sendcoinsdialog.cpp is pretty hacky, although it appears to have the desired effect. Perhaps you could take a look and suggest a better approach? This is my attempt to address the concern I mentioned in this comment: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5200#issuecomment-61545304",
