CreateNewBlock() checks every transaction against IsFinalTx() prior to including it in the template, so if I'm understanding the code correctly the worst that would happen is a transaction would be delayed from being mined and would sit in the mempool.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I and others have been thinking about changing the criteria for time-based nLockTime's to be compared against the median time rather than the block time for a number of incentive reasons. (possibly with a time-warp fix as well) At the very least I'm thinking of doing a patch to change the mempool behavior to accept txs based on the median rather than adjusted time.",
