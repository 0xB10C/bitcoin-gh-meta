I proposed earlier that we just add a very simple callback option to EvalScript() to optionally execute a function at each step in a way guaranteed to not be able to change the EvalScript() loop state unless desired.\r\n\r\nGiven how limited the scripting system is, I just don't see there being much demand for a full-on, fully consensus accurate, debugger; if you do need a debugger for your script it's almost certainly too complex. Simply providing a mechanism to get a good instruction trace if desired should be fine and it's a lot less risky than this pull-req.",
