The question is of course which window-of-11 to use; if you use 5-before-until-5-after, it's not usable for the last 5 blocks, but likely unbiased. If you use 10-before-0-after, you get a slight bias if blocks are speeding up/slowing down, but I doubt that'd be noticable on such a short time frame.",
