      "body" : "Two comments:\r\n* Shared locks are not recursive, so if any of these wallet callbacks causes a call to main, which causes a new callback, you have a deadlock. I don't believe such cases occur, but it's worth making a comment about it in the code.\r\n* There is still a potential deadlock when callbacks are combined with modifications to setpwalletRegistered. This is not a problem for now, as such modifications only happen at startup, but we need to think about this before fully-fledged multiwallet is added. In general, it will probably mean that RPC calls cannot gratuitously lock the wallet anymore - only those that need access to a wallet, and only the one the need. In particular, anything modifying the set of registered wallets will need a lock on setpwalletRegistered without locking any of the wallets in it.\r\n\r\nACK though.",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in contrib/test-scripts)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5.
