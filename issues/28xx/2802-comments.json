The ordering is oldest transaction first;\r\nif skip is negative the order returned is newest transaction first and skip+1\r\ntransactions are skipped. If verbose=0 only txids are returned rather than\r\nthe full transactions.\r\n```",

Heh, timestamp your orphan blocks and it would even be reasonable to maintain a set of every orphan ever created after the fact *while* allowing users to submit new blocks to this database even far into the future.

I'm seeing testnet txids a1f6a4ffcfd7bb4775790932aff1f82ac6a9b3b3e76c8faf8b11328e948afcca and 75f7d5e99912875e88d667afb48021b0b74916539c518618a8db4966661509df returned in the results - the former has a standard scriptPubKey, and a nonstandard scriptSig of \"1\", or hex \"51\". (IE push the number 1 to the stack) The latter has a totally empty scriptPubkey. Opcode 51 isn't within the range of opcodes 0 to PUSHDATA4, so BuildAddrIndex should have gone to the !fHaveData branch, but that returns Hash160(script), which is definitely not empty.\r\n\r\nA search for a script of just opcode 52, Hash160('\\x52') doesn't show this problem, (returns empty) and searching for script's without pushdata's like Hash160(''\\x61') (op_nop) also works as expected. Oddly though Hash160('\\x51\\x51'), two pushes of the constant 1 to the stack, doesn't work and returns nothing even though there is a script exactly equal to that.\r\n\r\nI'll be honest, I'm a bit mystified, although I haven't delved into a debugger yet.",

It also means that I'm reliant on two extremely unstable and latent services for something which -addrindex would have allowed locally. \r\n\r\nI realise that I can still just continue on using -addrindex as my own patch, but it would be of benefit to others to have something like it available in the main builds for developers who aren't aware it exists.
