   "body" : "Currently, various tests use `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` because it was convenient for the refactor that introduced the `ScriptPubKeyMan` interface. However, with the legacy wallet slated to be removed, these tests should not continue to use `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` as they are not testing any specific legacy wallet behavior. These tests are changed to use `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan`s.\r\n\r\nSome of the coin selection tests and benchmarks had a global `testWallet`, but this seemed to cause some issues with ensuring that descriptors were set up in that wallet for each test. Those have been restructured to not have any global variables that may be modified between tests.\r\n\r\nThe tests which test specific legacy wallet behavior remain unchanged.",
