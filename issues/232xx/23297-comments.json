      "body" : "I've been exploring this a bit more. Currently two approaches, non of them really great. \r\n\r\n- a) Package the systemtap `sys/sdt.h` header as GUIX package in [manifest.scm](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/guix/manifest.scm) and make it available as _include_ during configure and build.\r\n  - See GUIX package definition below.\r\n  - While the package is available during configure and build, the header includes not are picked up automatically. Likely, an additional include needs to be set. \r\n- b) Include systemtap as package in `depends`\r\n  - We don't need systemtap. We only need the `sys/sdt.h` header file.\r\n  - depends are usually compiled, we don't want and need to compile systemtap here.\r\n\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/contrib/guix/manifest.scm b/contrib/guix/manifest.scm\r\nindex 580500605..3f4814ba3 100644\r\n--- a/contrib/guix/manifest.scm\r\n+++ b/contrib/guix/manifest.scm\r\n@@ -30,6 +30,7 @@\r\n              (gnu packages shells)\r\n              (gnu packages tls)\r\n              (gnu packages version-control)\r\n+             (guix build-system copy)\r\n              (guix build-system font)\r\n              (guix build-system gnu)\r\n              (guix build-system python)\r\n@@ -597,6 +598,27 @@ inspecting signatures in Mach-O binaries.\")\r\n   (package-with-extra-patches glibc-2.27\r\n     (search-our-patches \"glibc-2.27-riscv64-Use-__has_include__-to-include-asm-syscalls.h.patch\")))\r\n\r\n+(define-public systemtap-sdt\r\n+  (package\r\n+    (name \"systemtap-sdt\")\r\n+    (version \"4.6\")\r\n+    (source (origin\r\n+              (method url-fetch)\r\n+              (uri (string-append \"https://sourceware.org/systemtap/ftp/releases/systemtap-\" version\r\n+                                  \".tar.gz\"))\r\n+              (sha256\r\n+               (base32\r\n+                \"1bps2926x9m8mp2684wwwwjm4yb12mpylbnvnffk889b4c4p7yw0\"))))\r\n+    (build-system copy-build-system)\r\n+    (arguments\r\n+      '(#:install-plan\r\n+        '((\"includes/sys/sdt.h\" \"include/sys/sdt.h\"))))\r\n+    (synopsis \"Systemtap header files defining tracing probe marcos\")\r\n+    (description \"This package includes the <sys/sdt.h> header file used for static instrumentation compiled into userspace programs and libraries\")\r\n+    (home-page \"https://sourceware.org/systemtap/\")\r\n+    (license license:gpl2)))\r\n+\r\n (packages->manifest\r\n  (append\r\n   (list ;; The Basics\r\n@@ -637,7 +659,9 @@ inspecting signatures in Mach-O binaries.\")\r\n         lief\r\n         ;; Native gcc 7 toolchain\r\n         gcc-toolchain-7\r\n-        (list gcc-toolchain-7 \"static\"))\r\n+        (list gcc-toolchain-7 \"static\")\r\n+        ;; Tracing\r\n+        systemtap-sdt)\r\n   (let ((target (getenv \"HOST\")))\r\n     (cond ((string-suffix? \"-mingw32\" target)\r\n            ;; Windows\r\n```",
