   "body" : "The commit for #9573 has broken the ability to compile libbitcoin_server and the test and bench programs.\r\n\r\nThe compiler error is:\r\n\r\n> Error\tC2338\tSigned type required with mode NONNEGATIVE_SIGNED.\tlibbitcoin_server\tf:\\dev\\github\\bitcoin-msvc\\src\\serialize.h\t316\t\r\n\r\nIt looks like the static_assert in serialize.h is now more aggressively checking inputs. I've tracked down one of the static_assert triggers to a change from the same commit in blockchain.cpp line 838:\r\n\r\n`ss << VARINT(outputs.begin()->second.nHeight * 2 + outputs.begin()->second.fCoinBase, VarIntMode::NONNEGATIVE_SIGNED);`\r\n\r\nChanging the VarIntMode to DEFAULT removes one of the errors. From my inspection the two fields being encoded are both uint's so shouldn't need the NONNEGATIVE_SIGNED mode (of course that may be different with non-msvc compilers):\r\n\r\noutputs.begin()->second.nHeight is uint32_t\r\noutputs.begin()->second.fCoinBase is unsigned int\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure what the best approach to fix this is but am happy to do any further investigation if required.\r\n",
