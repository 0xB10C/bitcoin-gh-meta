A small analysis - \r\n\r\nThe error reported is `FileNotFoundError`, however, checking the code for creating temp files in python:\r\n```\r\ndef _mkstemp_inner(dir, pre, suf, flags):\r\n    \"\"\"Code common to mkstemp, TemporaryFile, and NamedTemporaryFile.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    names = _get_candidate_names()\r\n\r\n    for seq in xrange(TMP_MAX):\r\n        name = names.next()\r\n        file = _os.path.join(dir, pre + name + suf)\r\n        try:\r\n            fd = _os.open(file, flags, 0600)\r\n            _set_cloexec(fd)\r\n            return (fd, _os.path.abspath(file))\r\n        except OSError, e:\r\n            if e.errno == _errno.EEXIST:\r\n                continue # try again\r\n            raise\r\n\r\n    raise IOError, (_errno.EEXIST, \"No usable temporary file name found\")\r\n```\r\nSuch an error could not have originated from this function. So the OS created the file but its not visible? Reading the docs gives this - \r\n\r\n```\r\nUnder Unix, the directory entry for the file is either not created at all or is removed immediately after the file is created. \r\nOther platforms do not support this; your code should not rely on a temporary file created using this function having or not having a visible name in the file system.\r\n...\r\nWhether the name can be used to open the file a second time, while the named temporary file is still open, varies across platforms (it can be so used on Unix; it cannot on Windows NT or later). \r\n``` \r\n\r\n",
