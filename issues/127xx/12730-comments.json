Signed proofs can be done without keybase, and the release key isn't even used on social media platforms so signed proofs for such accounts are pointless. Furthermore, the release key is not Wladimir's personal PGP key so it doesn't even have social media accounts to be associated with (such accounts should be associated with Wladimir's personal PGP key). The release key is used solely in releases which are published on a mailing list and for the signed hashes file. The fact that the release key has been used before to sign emails from Wladimir's email address is enough proof that he owns the private key.",
