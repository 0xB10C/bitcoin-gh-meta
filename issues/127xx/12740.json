   "body" : "Support is added to serialize arrays of type `char` or `unsigned char` directly, without any wrappers. All invocations of the `FLATDATA` wrappers that are obsoleted by this are removed.\r\n\r\nThis includes a patch by @ryanofsky to make `char` casting type safe.\r\n\r\nThe serialization of `CSubNet` is changed to serialize a `bool` directly rather than though `FLATDATA`. This makes the serialization independent of the size of the bool type (and will use 1 byte everywhere).\r\n\r\nThis is a small change taken from #10785.",
