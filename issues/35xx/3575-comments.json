All I am saying is that for someone that only needs bitcoind ( especially on windows ) this method is very far more complicated than one would expect. I dont' want to go through all the different permutation I have been through in order to achieve a gitian build. Suffice it to say the Host machine is also extremely relevant in the process. i.e. the Gitian build can't be build in a VM since it is a VM Host itself. i.e. in order to build a few megabyte windows .exe one needs 3 Precise's  setup as hosts and guests. i.e. a dedicated box that will run Virtualbox perfectly. I am picking apart the bulld but cant seem to find the best --host to pass to ./configure for a cross compile to windows.",
