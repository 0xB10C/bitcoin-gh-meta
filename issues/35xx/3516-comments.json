The problem is just that if you're syncing from two peers at once, some ranges of blocks are bound to be downloaded in incorrect order.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly possible to improve this, and try to prevent starting a second sync from another peer if another is ongoing, but this sounds hard to do right and guarantee to deal well with all weird edge cases that can arise.",
