No symlinks.\r\n\r\nThe wallet can't be corrupted, because it simply doesn't exist. ;-) The data dir is empty, as I wrote. Tried to run with already created wallet.dat on local dir - same error. Bitcoin with datadir on local disk works flawless. So it's seems the wallet.dat isn't accessable/openable from netowrk drive. I see the solution, but don't know it's possible to run bitcoind with -datadir [network drive] -walletfile [wallet.dat on local drive], but see no that option yet.\r\n\r\nMonths ago I have tried to do the same thing on Linux using ftpfs or curlftpfs (can't remember) - similar effect.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm sure I'd like to run Bitcoind with data dir on network drive. It's because I have many fast servers around the world (few per continents) with very low disk space and I thought it would be great to support Bitcoin network to run bitcoind on these servers, which some of them have more than years of uptime. :-)\r\n",
