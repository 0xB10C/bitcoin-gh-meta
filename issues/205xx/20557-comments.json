I'm not sure if that's necessary and don't see any downside to keeping the same bucketing if restarting with a new asmap. If others agree, I can update this PR to not do that rebucketing.\r\n\r\nThat would mean that asmap is applied to only newly learned addresses, which is a downside (assuming asmap is an improvement). On the other hand, losing the existing 8 buckets is unfortunate.\r\nI'm fine either way.\r\n\r\nWe could do the 8 existing + 1 asmap bucket if we really want... but that also has some consequences of potentially overriding existing buckets etc.\r\n\r\nAlso, we should keep in mind that non-rebucketing on a new asmap may allow existing records to appear in 16 buckets now instead of 8 (probably *all* existing records on first asmap appearance). Which is... also not particularly terrible but should be considered?",

The choice is between throwing away those bucket positions or not.\r\n\r\nI expressed my agreement with you in the following sentence: \"On the other hand, losing the existing 8 buckets is unfortunate.\". Still, ideally, we would apply a new asmap to existing addrs without losing the data. Unfortunately, since we don't store addr source, we have to make this choice between the two. And I agree that of these 2 choices, the one you're suggesting is probably better.\r\n\r\n>No. We won't add an entry to more than 8 buckets: \r\n\r\nGood to know! That was just my wrong assumption without looking deep into code :)",
