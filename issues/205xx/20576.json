   "body" : "The `net` logging currently encompasses a potpourri of low and high level events with great differences in frequency; it is extremely noisy and contains very different types of events.\r\n\r\nYet, contributors continue to propose moving even more logging into it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can consider creating different levels of net logging.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we could separate lower-frequency, important peer-level events (`netpeers`) from very high-frequency message-level passing (`netmessages`).\r\n\r\nCategories and naming suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\nOne further suggestion was:\r\n> No objections. I'd take it ever further though, and add an (optional) logging severity (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR or similar) that can be added to all log messages. The user can then either choose what severity logs they want for each category (eg = -debug=net:warning,tor:debug etc), or have a logging post-processor that can filter by severity/category.\r\n\r\nI do indeed like the idea of optional logging levels (debug/info/warning/error) for each category, including the default debug log, but agreement on which events go into which level may be prone to bikeshedding. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I propose separating the net logging into at least two categories. Thoughts? Implementation suggestions?",
