   "body" : "Builds on top of #20514. Alternative to #20509.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `CAddress` disk serialization was messy. It stored `CLIENT_VERSION` in the first 4 bytes, optionally OR'ed with `ADDRV2_FORMAT`.\r\n- Of this stored version, all bits except `ADDRV2_FORMAT` were ignored, making it hard to use for actual future format changes.\r\n- The encoding of `nServices` was determined by the **stored** version.\r\n- The encoding of the embedded `CServices` object was determined by the **stream** version.\r\n    \r\nTo improve the situation, this commit introduces the following disk serialization format, compatible with earlier versions, but better defined for future changes:\r\n- The first 4 bytes store a format version number. Its low 19 bits are ignored (as those historically stored the `CLIENT_VERSION`), but its high 13 bits specify the actual serialization:\r\n  - 0x00000000: LE64 encoding for `nServices`, V1 encoding for `CService` (like pre-BIP155 network serialization).\r\n  - 0x20000000: CompactSize encoding for `nServices`, V2 encoding for `CService` (like BIP155 network serialization).\r\n  - Any other value triggers an unsupported format error on deserialization, and can be used for future format changes.\r\n- The `ADDRV2_FORMAT` flag in the stream's version does not impact the actual serialization format; it only determines whether V2 encoding is permitted.\r\n    \r\nOperationally the changes to the deserializer are:\r\n- Failure when the stored format version number is unexpected.\r\n- The embedded `CService`'s format is determined by the stored format version number rather than the stream's version number.\r\n\r\nThese do no introduce incompatibilities, as no code versions exist that write any value other than 0 or 0x20000000 in the top 13 bits, and no code paths where the stream's version differs from the stored version.\r\n",
