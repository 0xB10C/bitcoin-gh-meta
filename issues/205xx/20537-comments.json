      "body" : "Not sure about this. I've been working in #20391 to move the use of COIN (or 1e8) and 1000 from CFeeRate callers all into policy/feerate, where their use is documented. This partially does the opposite without removing the other ones, seems less clear next to the btc/kvb line, and brings in a dependency. There may be a better abstraction we can do for ToString, but I think it should handle both sat/vB and BTC/kvB and also returning both with and without the units. Ideas welcome.",
