I would love this feature!!!!! I think you can do this with command line but it's risky and not simple. I ask because I only use Bitcoin Core as my wallet and don't have easy cold storage spending method without bringing all online.\r\n\r\nThank you and I love you all!\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem?
