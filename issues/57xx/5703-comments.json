      "body" : "In the CCheckQueueControl constructor, we're not acquiring the lock on the pqueue before checking its state:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCCheckQueueControl(CCheckQueue<T>* pqueueIn) : pqueue(pqueueIn), fDone(false)\r\n    {\r\n        // passed queue is supposed to be unused, or NULL\r\n        if (pqueue != NULL) {\r\n            assert(pqueue->nTotal == pqueue->nIdle);\r\n            assert(pqueue->nTodo == 0);\r\n            assert(pqueue->fAllOk == true);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsequently I think there could be a race condition where these values could look inconsistent (nIdle is updated each time in the thread's Loop()).\r\n\r\nI was able to reliably reproduce this behavior by inserting a ```usleep(500000);``` in CCheckQueue::Loop, just before the call to ```nIdle++;```, and then starting up with a reindex.\r\n\r\nTo fix this I think we just need to acquire the pqueue's lock before checking these variables; perhaps add an IsIdle() member function to CCheckQueue that acquires the lock and then does these checks, and then assert that function returns true in the CCheckQueueControl constructor?\r\n",
