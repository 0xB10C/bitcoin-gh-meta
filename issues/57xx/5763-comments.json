      "body" : "> I need the inverse of dumpprivkey. Given a private key, I need to get the corresponding address.\n\nIf you have the private key, you can use several utilities to get the address (google for sx, ku, pybitcointools, ...). This surely doesnÃ¢ÂÂt belong to RPC. Private key is cryptographic material!!!\n\nPlease close this issue.",

A better place for it would be in a library, and indeed there are various such libraries available for different programming languages (e.g. bitcoin-pythonlib for python). There is no advantage (and insecurity through potential interception) to using RPC, and also bottleneck issues.\r\n",
