      "body" : "Thanks for reporting!\r\n\r\n10.6 is supported for this release (though deprecated and officially dropped for 0.11). The user-base is small though, so it's possible that it went untested through the rc series.\r\n\r\nDoes bitcoind have the same issues? You can grab it from here: https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.10.0/bitcoin-0.10.0-osx64.tar.gz . That would be a good thing to know as a starting point for tracking down the problem. It would also be helpful to run the tests from that tarball.\r\n\r\nFor more helpful debugging, here's an unstripped 0.10 bitcon-qt built with extra debugging enabled. The usual disclaimer applies: please assume that I'm trying to trick you into stealing your coins by having you run this binary (I'm not though :). If you understand and would still like to help, grab the binary here: https://bitcoincore.org/cfields/bitcoin-0.10.0/bitcoin-0.10-osx-debug\r\n\r\nIf that still crashes, the output should be much more helpful.",
