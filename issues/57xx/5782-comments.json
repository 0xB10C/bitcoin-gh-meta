      "body" : "Thanks for the link! Unfortunally it doesn't seem to be related, but this issue is certainly something that probably won't appear outside of a testing environment. I created a test for it nevertheless:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dexX7/bitcoin/blob/qa-coin-selection-limit/qa/rpc-tests/coinselection_size_limit.py\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the coin selection doesn't relate to the transaction size at all. I came up with three scenarios, all failing at the moment:\r\n\r\nScenario 1:\r\n - The actor starts with 1x 50.0 BTC and 1000x 0.05 BTC (100.0 BTC total) unspent outputs\r\n - Then tries to spend 49.5 BTC\r\n - The 50.0 BTC output should be selected, because the transaction would otherwise be too large\r\n \r\nScenario 2:\r\n - The actor starts with 500x 0.1 BTC and 1000x 0.05 BTC (100.0 BTC total) unspent outputs\r\n - Then tries to spend 49.5 BTC\r\n - A combination of coins should be selected, such that the created transaction is not too large\r\n \r\nScenario 3 (available as RPC test):\r\n - The actor starts with 1x 50.0 BTC, 500x 0.1 BTC and 1000x 0.05 BTC (150.0 BTC total) unspent outputs\r\n - Then tries to spend 49.5 BTC\r\n - A combination of coins should be selected, such that the created transaction is not too large\r\n\r\nFor each scenario at least one solution exists, where a combination of coins results in a transaction that has a size of less than `MAX_STANDARD_TX_SIZE`.",
