In the short-term future for pulls like this, please PR them directly to the trivial-next branch in https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin . These will be merged into mainline bitcoin every few weeks.\r\n\r\nThis has been setup to reduce the PR load on the main bitcoin repo. If this goes well, a bitcoin-trivial tree will likely be setup under the bitcoin organization.",
