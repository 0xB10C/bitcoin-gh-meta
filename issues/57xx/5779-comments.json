      "body" : "I believe we should have per-layer flags.\r\n\r\nThat means making the flags exported by libconsensus separate from the ones in the internal implementations, and libconsensus translates them as necessary. That both means implementation detals don't leak out (visibly or invisibly).\r\n\r\nI also don't think libconsensus should be implementing any standardness checks. They're policy, and not part of libconsensus' goal (which is to be policy neutral, and just provide the one thing that is too risky to reimplement).",
