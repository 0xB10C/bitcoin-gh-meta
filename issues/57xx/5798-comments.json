The results are not at all obvious.. \"run bitcoin-qt now\" from the installer runs as the admin user. After that, running the .exe from program files (no shortcuts are installed for the current user) prompts for a data path. Probably exactly what you saw when running the official setup.exe as Administrator.\r\n\r\nIt appears as though non-trivial changes to the installer would be needed.\r\n\r\nIt's been quite a while since I've used a Windows environment, do most applications fare well in this scenario?",
