      "body" : "I think moving it to a separate repository would be a mistake for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) A separate repository would get less review and analysis. We have objective evidence from libsecp256k1 which is absolutely essential to the system, both in the form of lower traffic in its repo and some comments only happening when we go to merge an update to Bitcoin core.\r\n\r\n(2) A separate repository will create more difficulty for people fetching the project from git to use it and a steeper learning curve for new developers. The 'btcd' project, as I understand, has recently switched from many repositories to escape these difficulties.\r\n\r\n(3) A separate repository increases the risk of version drift where users suffer unexpected behavior because they are using never tested before mixed versions. (Though this is less of an issue the more SPV the new wallet is)\r\n\r\n(4) There is also less opportunity for code sharing due to the need to sync across both projects.\r\n\r\nSo I think this should not be a goal in and of itself. If the new wallet ends up mostly being \"orthogonally maintained\" in practice, then it might make sense to split it after all... but we should let that practice drive the procedure there, not the other way around. :)\r\n\r\nThere is a long list of wallet features hiding someplace that I found interesting that I can probably share with you. I'll look for it.",

      "body" : "Although I don't disagree with any of @gmaxwell's arguments, we should not ignore the organizational side.  The scope of this project is too broad. If the wallet is to grow beyond a 'reference wallet'. To have a successful wallet project it needs to be maintained by people focused on developing a wallet, and also have specific goal. E.g. end-user wallet application or scalable, multi-user enterprise wallet? Or a library that can be used to develop both kinds? All are valid goals, persued on their own.\r\n\r\nCurrently it's everything in between, a Rorschach blot of features. There's no clear direction. Which makes sense as this is the general 'bitcoin' project. Different people all expect something else from it. It's good enough for many things but not excellent at any. People then think this is an inherent limitation of Bitcoin instead of just a heavily bottlenecked dev team.\r\n\r\nAlso: As I've mentioned many times, having issues about the UI, wallet, and global consensus in one repository is very distracting. I think this repository should eventually focus on maintaining the P2P node. That doesn't mean 'drop the wallet now!'. Maintaining an example wallet is OK. But by definition it will be very generic.\r\n\r\nHaving said that  (**sorry for hijacking this thread, but some things need to be said**), I'm ok with developing the \"newwallet\" as part of this repository for the shorter term, and with the changes outlined in @jonasschnelli's post. But in the medium to longer term I believe the current way of working is a burden.\r\n",
