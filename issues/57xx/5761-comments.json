      "body" : "I think moving it to a separate repository would be a mistake for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) A separate repository would get less review and analysis. We have objective evidence from libsecp256k1 which is absolutely essential to the system, both in the form of lower traffic in its repo and some comments only happening when we go to merge an update to Bitcoin core.\r\n\r\n(2) A separate repository will create more difficulty for people fetching the project from git to use it and a steeper learning curve for new developers. The 'btcd' project, as I understand, has recently switched from many repositories to escape these difficulties.\r\n\r\n(3) A separate repository increases the risk of version drift where users suffer unexpected behavior because they are using never tested before mixed versions. (Though this is less of an issue the more SPV the new wallet is)\r\n\r\n(4) There is also less opportunity for code sharing due to the need to sync across both projects.\r\n\r\nSo I think this should not be a goal in and of itself. If the new wallet ends up mostly being \"orthogonally maintained\" in practice, then it might make sense to split it after all... but we should let that practice drive the procedure there, not the other way around. :)\r\n\r\nThere is a long list of wallet features hiding someplace that I found interesting that I can probably share with you. I'll look for it.",
