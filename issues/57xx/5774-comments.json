If there is some reason that creation times are being set incorrectly that must be fixed, not papered over with a bypass in rescan.\r\n\r\nIf you update the patch, please make sure the commit message explains the motivation for the change.",

Bitcoin should probably persist something into the wallet letting it know it needs to rescan from block 0, but I'm not familiar enough with the code to do this.",
