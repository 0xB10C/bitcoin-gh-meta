Being able to create transactions (using bitcoin-cores coin and fee selection) without pushing them on the network has a lot of use-cases: multi-sig, offline,  and in my personal case I would **much** prefer to push transactions over tor than push them to peers. \r\n\r\n(I do not wish to run the entire node behind tor, and as I process hundreds of user-requested transfers per day, if I connect to arbitrary nodes on the network it is trivial for an attacker to learn my node's ip address for either DoS'ing it, or listening to my node to see what other transactions I (probably) created).\r\n\r\nIf I had a way of creating the transaction, and *not* sending it, I could easily listen to the general network and merely push my transactions over tor. \r\n\r\n(And yes, I'm aware of createrawtransaction, but the interface is far too low-level to work with. Writing coin selection and fee calculations is something I'd rather not concern myself with)",
