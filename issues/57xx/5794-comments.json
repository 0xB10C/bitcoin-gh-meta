      "body" : "I haven't heard any discussion about such confusion myself. But I agree that ERROR is too strong here because this is part of `AcceptToMemoryPool` standard behaviour and doesn't need user's attention.\r\nOne or two days `debug.log` contains the following here:\r\n```\r\nERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: inputs already spent\r\nERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: nonstandard transaction: dust\r\nERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: free transaction rejected by rate limiter\r\n```\r\nNone of these messages is an error, but standard information message about tx not being accepted to mempool. Looking at other `AcceptToMemoryPool` log messages in `debug.log`, I'd drop \"category/level\" prefix (ERROR: here) completely and change the message to contain \"not accepted\".\r\n",
