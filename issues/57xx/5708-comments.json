I feel like the latter sounds more natural, but either way it should be consistent.\r\n* Not sure I completely understand the logic behind the use of bold and italics, but maybe that's just me\r\n* I don't think it's necessary to mention rc versions -- they're a technicality of the release process, I think they can just be listed as v0.10.0.\r\n* Was 0.9 still called Bitcoin-Qt? I thought we were calling it Bitcoin Core GUI (or just \"the GUI\") now.\r\n\r\nOther than that, as far as I can tell, looks good. ACK.",
