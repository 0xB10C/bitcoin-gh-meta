Strings change too quickly for it to be worth bothering translators. Some strings might even be introduced temporarily and not make a release, for example in the case of a mistaken `_(\"â¦\")`. Translators are only involved after the soft string freeze. This is 2022-02-02 for 23.0 (see #22969).\r\n\r\nThat said, doing a one-time pull of translations *from transifex* before forking the branch doesn't hurt.\r\n",
