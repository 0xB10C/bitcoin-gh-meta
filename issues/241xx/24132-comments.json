As you mentioned:\r\n> it seems unreasonable to stick to Qt 5.9, which support ended on 2020-05-31\r\n\r\nI agree with the reasoning. However, when I checked for the Standard Support for **Qt 5.11.3**, I noticed it ended on **2019-05-22**.\r\nSo if we are upgrading the minimum version, why are we choosing the version whose support ended almost two years ago?",
