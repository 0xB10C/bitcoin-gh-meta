   "body" : "This change lets the `coinstatsindex` fail loudly in case the internal `muhash` state differs from the last finalized output saved on disk, which would indicate that the `muhash` state somehow got out of sync. This should generally not happen since both are written to disk in a batch but #24076 seems to indicate that the might still be an issue.\r\n\r\nSince #24076 so far can not be reproduced reliably, the issue should not be closed yet. Further investigation and testing needs to be done.",
