   "body" : "Extend inbound eviction protection for peers connected over CJDNS, as is currently the case for peers connected via onion, localhost, and I2P.  CJDNS peers seem to have better min ping latency than onion and I2P peers but still higher than that of unencrypted IPv4/6 peers and can be disadvantaged under our eviction criteria. They are also very few in number, which is a further reason to protect them, as the goal of this logic is to favorise the diversity of our peer connections.  CJDNS support was added in #23077 for the upcoming v23 release.",
