So the randomization is already sufficiently covered.\r\n\r\nI'd imagine that the \"randomly terminate at the exact point or later\" from the first part is a kind of randomness with a distribution that is strongly peaked around some point after this \"exact point\" (depending on hardware etc.). So whether the first part really covers the kind of randomness that the second part seems to depend on many factors, among them the density of the net of predefined lines provided in the first part. \r\n\r\nThe \"random line number\" part contributes a more uniform randomness of lines to stop after, so it doesn't seem completely redundant to me.\r\n\r\n@jamesob : any thoughts on this?",
