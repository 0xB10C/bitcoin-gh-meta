But PR #22093 branch was not rebased on top of #23489: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2fda0c785188ae94fba921c1b8f6f2c005faf1d4/depends/packages/qt.mk#L2\r\n\r\nI apologize for that.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Seems like that PR needed more testing given this isn't the only issue its caused, i.e #24056.\r\n\r\n~Sure. Btw, I still not able to reproduce #24056.~",
