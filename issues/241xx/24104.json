   "body" : "Boost 1.78 removed `operator+` in a way that breaks our usage of it in a subclass. A [proposed workaround](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/223#issuecomment-1000230207) for this is to cast the argument to `boost::filesystem::path`, and this is backwards compatible with older versions of boost.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it appears that `fs::canonical` no longer removes trailing slashes. This was causing a test to fail. The solution is to explicitly remove the trailing separator in the one place that `fs::canonical` is used.\r\n\r\nLastly, `fs::create_directories` now has an error message saying `create_directories` instead of `create_directory`. This caused wallet_multiwallet.py to fail. The error message check has been updated to be able accept either string.\r\n\r\nFixes #23846",
