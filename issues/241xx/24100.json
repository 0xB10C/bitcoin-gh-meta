   "body" : "If we remove the consensus protocol (blockchain and mining) what do we get?  We're left with what Satoshi Nakamoto had before he added the consensus protocol.  No blockchain, no mining, just the transaction history with nothing to protect it from double spend attacks.\r\n\r\nHere I present what I call \"proof of advanced delegation\" (PAD).\r\n\r\nPAD eliminates double spends by spending them in advance.  When a utxo is created, a transaction that spends it is created too and it's txid is embedded in the utxo before it gets published.  The last transaction is not yet spent so it remains unpublished.\r\n\r\nto make a payment:\r\nThe sender gets the receiver's payment address and creates a new transaction that spends one or more of his unpublished utxos and pays the exact amount to an output with the receiver's address.  If needed, he creates another output for change to himself and creates an unpublished transaction that spends that output.  He then publishes the transactions that he just spent and sends this new transaction and sigs to the receiver in secret.  The receiver creates two new transactions of his own, one that spends the sender's new transaction and one that spends his own new transaction (unpublished). He then publishes the two completed txs as a pair.\r\n\r\nSince every published utxo is bound to the txid of the unpublished transaction that spends it, there is no opportunity to double spend them therefore no consensus mechanism is required.",
