Also we can't measure if it really is used \"scarcely\"; we could only infer that, indirectly, if for example _nobody_ uses P2PKH addresses anymore.\r\n\r\nThat said, we should probably never implement `aopp` URI support, at least not any `VASP` specific features of it (and calling external URL's is also problematic).
