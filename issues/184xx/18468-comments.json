      "body" : "Here is one caveat that may not be obvious: whenever you have some iterator/pointer/object that stores objects of type `A` (which supertype `B`), it should *not* be possible to construct a `Span<B>` for it, despite `A*` being implicitly convertible to `B*`. The reason is that `A` and `B` may have different sizes, so pointer arithmetic in one may not correspond to the right operations in the other.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented - here and in the C++20 `std::span` - by checking that *arrays to* `A` can be converted to *arrays to* `B`.",
