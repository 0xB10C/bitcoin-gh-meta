      "body" : "Here is one caveat that may not be obvious: whenever you have some iterator/pointer/object that stores objects of type `B` (which supertype `A`), it should *not* be possible to construct a `Span<A>` for it, despite `B*` being implicitly convertible to `A*`. The reason is that `A` and `B` may have different sizes, so pointer arithmetic in one may not correspond to the right operations in the other.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented - here and in the C++20 `std::span` - by checking that *arrays of* `B` can be converted to *arrays of* `A`.",
