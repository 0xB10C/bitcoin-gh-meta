      "body" : "Yeah I found this while fiddling with things in Elements and reproduced this using Bitcoin Core 0.19.1. I can't say for sure which one of the parts is behaving wrongly.\r\n\r\nThis is a stat of one of the txs:\r\n```\r\n  \"size\": 418,\r\n  \"vsize\": 256,\r\n  \"weight\": 1024,\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```\r\n  \"fee\": -0.00000281,\r\n```\r\nSo that would be `1097.65625` sat/kvB. Which seems to be undershooting the feerate I'm setting in fundraw. So I'd think it's a fundraw bug.\r\n\r\nActually that's more interesting because it's not 1099, which could be a rounding problem. In Elements I was getting 99 instead of 100, which I attributed to rounding. But here it seems like the difference is 2.5 sats, which is more significant. It seems it's significant enough to not be allowed in the peer's mempool. (In my Elements testing, the txs did get relayed despite calculating to 1 sat/vkB short.)",
