A bunch of RPC calls return `NullUniValue`, and bitcoin-cli silently exits whenever that happens.\r\n\r\nBut returning `NullUniValue` usually means success, like with RPC calls like `ping`, `addnode`, `reconsiderblock`, and most other places.  In contrast, with `gettransaction`, `getrawtransaction`, `getblock`, `getmempoolentry` etc..., RPC errors are returned instead of `NullUniValue` when it can't find the transaction or block requested.  The JSON error then carries over into the `bitcoin-cli` response.\r\n\r\nIn fact, looking through the \"get*\" RPC calls, they all seem to return -5 erros when they can't find the thing specified...\r\n\r\nSo I guess the options are: change the RPC return to give back a \"not found\" error, to make it more in line with other \"get*\" RPC calls.  This is a breaking change though if people are expecting null responses for non-existent utxos.\r\n\r\nOr, there would have to be `gettxout` specific code in `bitcoin-cli`, since it does seem like most of the other `NullUniValue` feel \"correct\" in that they're traditional \"OK I did the thing you asked, no data to return\" situations.  This is certainly a bit of a hack / ugly to have RPC-specific code there.\r\n\r\nOr, 3rd option is to just leave it :)  Not a big deal.\r\nI certainly know what to expect from this RPC now, it just confused me for a few minutes when I was querying an invalid outpoint.
