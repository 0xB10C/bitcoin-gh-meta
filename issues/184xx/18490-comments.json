Which DLL was different?\r\n\r\nChecking case insensitively was bought up in #18395, but we didn't see a reason to do it, given that in gitian, everything is set. If DLLs are being randomly named during gitian builds, that not only sounds like a reproducibility issue, but something that should be reported upstream. So it would be good to get details.\r\n\r\nChecking insensitively would also seem to introduce the scenario where we could be linked against multiple DLLs, and the script wouldn't fail. I'd rather we check everything exactly, and get notified if the underlying DLLs change.\r\n\r\n",
