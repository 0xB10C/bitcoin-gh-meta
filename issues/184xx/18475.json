   "body" : "So I was fiddling with feerates today. I bumped into https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13283, but this seemed different.\r\n\r\nI have the following setup:\r\n- `-regtest` and `-minrelaytxfee=0.00001100` \r\n- one node makes a block every some seconds\r\n- other node has `-mintxfee=0.00001100` as well and connects to that node and creates a tx with createraw+fundraw+signraw+sendraw\r\n\r\nOn fundraw, I use `\"{\\\"feeRate\\\": 0.00001100}\"`.\r\n\r\nResult: the txs of the second node don't get relayed to the first node and don't get mined.\r\n\r\nSo my main reason for this research was to observe fee estimation. After a while, `estimatesmartfee 3` gives a feerate of `0.00001097`, which is just below the feeRate supposedly set in every txs in the blockchain & mempool (which seems weird on itself), but is also lower than the `minRelayTxFee` for that node.",
