I tried the code with the example from the issue thread.\n\nWorks:\n``addmultisigaddress 2 '[\"02404c0b780b0d3f70a57bccb0cac31c77e980d899db00f04a61052cf6500bde23\",\"02092eb733ce9027fcddb9917e841057c747318ff973de7a7768da9b3f039d6892\"]'``\n\nFails:\n``addmultisigaddress 2 '[\\\"02404c0b780b0d3f70a57bccb0cac31c77e980d899db00f04a61052cf6500bde23\\\",\\\"02092eb733ce9027fcddb9917e841057c747318ff973de7a7768da9b3f039d6892\\\"]'``\n\nThe problem I see here is the RPC error message, which says:\n``Error: Error parsing JSON:[\\\"02404c0b780b0d3f70a57bccb0cac31c77e980d899db00f04a61052cf6500bde23\\\",\\\"02092eb733ce9027fcddb9917e841057c747318ff973de7a7768da9b3f039d6892\\\"]``\n\nSo when using an input exactly like shown in the error message the command should not fail or perhaps it would be better to update the RPC commands help and error messages.\n\nBut I love the approach to don't need to escape on Windows :).",
