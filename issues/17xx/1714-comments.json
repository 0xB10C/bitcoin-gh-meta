Maybe that's good enough.\n\nHowever, showing the computed fee, which is only available after building the transaction, would require quite some re-ordering and re-thinking.\n\nCurrently the order of operating when the send button is clicked is:\n- Build list of recipients / amounts from UI\n- Show confirmation dialog\n- Ask passphrase to unlock encrypted wallet\n- WalletModel::sendCoins\n  - Do input checks (balance, duplicates, empties etc)\n  - With wallet mutex\n     - Build transaction outputs\n     - Create transaction -> determines inputs for outputs, **this returns the computed fee nFeeRequired**\n     - Callback: If the computed fee is higher than the configured fee, ask user if he accepts the fee\n     - Commit transaction (send to network)\n  - Update misc stuff (labels, addresses)\n\nSo that would effectively mean that the confirmation can only be shown *after* the transaction has been created, probably by splitting send into a two-stage process.\n",
