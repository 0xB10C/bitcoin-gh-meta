Or does everyone else manually run the builds/write their own script like I have up til this point?\r\n\r\nYes, it's my script and there was a reason for those two lines there (it fixed some problems for me in the past). Removing those two lines doesn't effect my setup now (for some reason) so it should be fine to remove them.\r\n\r\nEdit: Actually removing them does break my setup now.
