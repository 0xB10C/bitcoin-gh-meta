If there is any interest I can commit to keeping these comments up-to-date - including removing no longer needed locks (due to refactoring, etc.).\r\n\r\nFWIW, I have written a script that generates these comments automatically by using the `GUARDED_BY` annotations added in #11226. The comments added in this PR were created by running that script.",
