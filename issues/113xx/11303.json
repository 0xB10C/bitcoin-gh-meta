   "body" : "This fixes an issue where estimatesmartfee which matches at the min relay fee will return 999 sat/byte instead of 1000 sat/byte due to a float rounding issue. I went ahead and made all float <-> int conversion outside of test/qt explicit (test only had one or two more, Qt had quite a few, including many in the Qt headers themselves) and added overloads to CFeeRate to force callers to do an explicit round themselves. Easy to test with -Wfloat-conversion.",
