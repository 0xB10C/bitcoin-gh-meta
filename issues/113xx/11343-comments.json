If your wallet is unencrypted (i.e. not using Bitcoin Core's wallet encryption), then those temporary files will be written to your unencrypted disk anyways and they may contain your unencrypted private keys. So keeping your wallet file on an encrypted disk is not helping as your private keys are unencrypted to the database software and may be written to an unencrypted disk while the wallet is in use.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure I'm seeing how being on the same filesystem would prevent corruption. In my particular case, though, they are on the same filesystem, but the wallet goes through encfs to an underlying encrypted file on the filesystem.\r\n\r\nUsing symbolic linking may imply that you are attempting to use the same wallet file with different instances of Bitcoin Core (using an encrypted filesystem and symlinking is only one use case) which have different datadirs. If you were to shut down Bitcoin Core and the wallet database is not closed cleanly, there will be left over wallet database files in the datadir (i.e. not with the actual wallet file). If you then try to open it with another instance of Bitcoin Core with a different datadir, since the wallet.dat file was closed uncleanly and because the other datadir does not have the necessary wallet database files, you can have your wallet file corrupted.",
