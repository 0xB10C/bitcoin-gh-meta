      "body" : "What might be useful along with this is some documentation on files within the .bitcoin directory that are affected by the wallet (not only those with potential for corruption of the wallet itself).\r\n\r\nFor example - debug.log can contain information on 'interesting' txids (AddToWallet messages, as I recall), and so if you're storing the wallet on another filesystem for the purpose of encrypting pubkeys at rest, even if you've included all BDB state, a lot of that information will 'leak' into debug.log. This isn't a concern for me in particular, but there are probably many different reasons users would like to store their wallets seperately (it would be useful if those use cases were posted here, I think?)",
