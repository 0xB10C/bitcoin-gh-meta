Clock starts at UpdateTip height=1. prune=550 dbcache=3000.\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--------+----------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n| height | unpruned | pruned (this PR) | pruned (master) |\r\n+--------+----------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n| 250000 |     427s |             593s |            724s |\r\n| 300000 |     916s |            1076s |           1402s |\r\n| 350000 |    1443s |            1979s |           2707s |\r\n+--------+----------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n```\r\nAt height 350000, this PR results in a 529MiB dbcache vs. a 2646MiB dbcache unpruned.\r\nThe pruned node ends up with approx. 30MiB.\r\n110 seconds should be added to serialize the dbcache on the unpruned node's shutdown (the other two cases were single digit seconds).\r\n\r\nFinal result is that the node can sync to height 350000 27% faster than without the PR by giving the prune target ~3GiB leeway. I didn't want to spend the time to reach the end but I suspect results would be similar or better.\r\n\r\nAs in the above post, this is only a 'partial fix' because the dbcache is still limited empirically to far lower than the actual value.\r\n\r\nedit: Ah yes, space requirements. In this test the chainstate folder's final size is ~1GiB and the prune is allowed to overshoot by ~3GiB, so it raises the maximum disk space requirement by ~2GiB in this example.",
