I think something like #11398 makes sense, and it supports setting segwit to always being on in regtest as well, so I'd prefer that we do that instead.\r\n",

      "body" : "@jnewbery Good points, but perhaps I'm not making my intent clear.\r\n\r\nI'll start with describing my ideal end goal:\r\n* There is an option to configure the height at which (any) consensus rule activated, both for old deployments, and (originally) BIP9 deployments.\r\n* When no special activate-at-height is given, the normal activation rules (BIP9 or otherwise) apply.\r\n* After a deployment is buried, the height-activation can be made default for that deployment, and its old deployment logic removed. Depending on whether tests need it or historical exceptions, it could be removed entirely and hardcoded.\r\n\r\nHaving this means that for a new softfork it's possible to write a test that has the new rule always active, or only active at some particular height (and not needing to go through hoops to activate it by mining blocks manually) - while it's not even defined on mainnet.\r\n\r\nThis functionality partially overlaps with the requirements for #11403 (not needing to go through activation for tests that are unrelated to SegWit activation), which indirectly also needs a way to have P2SH always active.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements effectively what was described above, but with the caveats (1) only for BIP9 deployments and BIP16 and (2) through a pretty hacky way of classifying BIP16 as a VB deployment. All of that can be cleaned up by having explicit *buried* deployments, though. This is regtest-only functionality that doesn't need much compatibility between releases IMHO.\r\n\r\nI think it's also orthogonal to the question of actually completely removing the segwit or P2SH deployments - both of those are useful too, but as discussed in the meeting today, that may not be super trivial.\r\n\r\nFinally,\r\n\r\n> We already have control to make a BIP9 deployment active at a certain height in regtest using -vbparams. What advantages do you see for making a deployment buried instead of just activated at a height?\r\n\r\nThat just doesn't accomplish the goal, as BIP9 can at the earliest activate a deployment at 3*interval, which is at height 432 for regtest. For SegWit wallet support I really want a way to have its rules always active. It's certainly possible to go modify all the heights in all the tests, but that's busywork, and it really shouldn't be the test's responsibility to deal with that.",
