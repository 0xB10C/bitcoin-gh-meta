Only potential issue is the case when the GUI is almost entirely offscreen with only a single strip of pixels, its not really possible to see the GUI, but if you know it's there you can bring it back onscreen with just the mouse. And that's exactly how notepad behaves on Windows so I don't think its a real issue.\r\n\r\nGitian build here: https://bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch/build/305",
