Since we shoved the legacy (BDB) wallet into a box (`LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`), we probably won't be touching its internals (often). Just have to remember, when we do, to be a bit extra careful.\r\n\r\nAre you sure this actually removes BDB from that task? E.g. `BDB_PREFIX` is still used in `BITCOIN_CONFIG`. Maybe explicitly opt-out with `--without-bdb` (also for clarity).",
