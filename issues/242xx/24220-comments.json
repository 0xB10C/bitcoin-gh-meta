      "body" : "I recall that the reason IsIBD was written like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbool CChainState::IsInitialBlockDownload() const\r\n{\r\n    // Optimization: pre-test latch before taking the lock.\r\n    if (m_cached_finished_ibd.load(std::memory_order_relaxed))\r\n        return false;\r\n\r\n    LOCK(cs_main);\r\n```\r\n\r\nis so that in the common case -- which is that we've already latched to false -- that we can respond without ever acquiring cs_main inside this function. \r\n\r\nMaybe there's a better refactor that could be done so that we can reduce locking contention on cs_main further, but this patch would have all the call sites grab the lock in order to even call IsIBD(), which would add more cs_main lock acquisitions in general -- and that seems counter to where we want to end up?\r\n\r\nIs the motivation for this patch to reduce the uses of cs_main as a recursive mutex, and thereby get to a better design?  If so that sounds like a good direction, but I think it'd be better if we avoided adding extra lock acquisitions (and holding cs_main longer) in order to get there.  For instance it seems like with this patch some of the validation callbacks will now be invoked while holding cs_main the whole time?  That seems undesirable.",
