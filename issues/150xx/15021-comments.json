A good reason for a policy of failing on unknown settings would be eliminating the annoyance of having to figure out that your configuration is broken and then having to restart the node---which is something that can take a long time (e.g. if you have a high db cache or are using an underpowered computer) and which inexperienced users might not know how to do (or might do wrong, e.g. sending SIGKILL rather than SIGTERM, which could result in a need to reindex).\r\n\r\nBased on my own misadventures, wrongly configuring a node is a much more common problem than wanting to use a future/spinoff configuration file with an old/baseline node, so I think we should optimize for helping users fix misconfigurations as fast and painlessly as possible.",
