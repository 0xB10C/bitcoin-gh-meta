The compiler will optimize out a test like this when it is actually useless,  and yet to the extent that the removal does anything it will simply make the code more brittle against any future change in the underlying type.\r\n\r\nActually looking at the code, I see that the test is actually <= 0, so this would-- in fact-- change the behaviour.  So, in fact, the change AFAICT introduces a bug-- which again makes a case for not making these sorts of changes.",
