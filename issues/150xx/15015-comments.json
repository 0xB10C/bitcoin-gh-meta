I did not see a real difference in performance between the four configurations.\r\n\r\n- Debian 4.19.37amd64 (2019-08-08) x86_64 - Intel Core i7-6500U 2.50GHz Ã 4 - 32GB\r\n- MacOS 10.14.6 - MacBook Pro Retina 2012 - Intel Core i7 2.7GHz - 16GB 1600 DDR3\r\n\r\nThe test was to load several wallets, 2-3 small wallets and then one large 177MB wallet, and run various console commands like getbalances, getwalletinfo, listwallets, etc. The large wallet is a regtest one generated with @achow101's [make-big-wallet.py](https://gist.github.com/achow101/f24309bba501cc08c9a3a3d55fa6eec6) script. \r\n\r\nOn both Debian and MacOS it takes the GUI 5-6 minutes to load the big wallet.\r\n\r\n![gui-big-wallet-loading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2415484/77901255-d1cc0800-726e-11ea-9567-05084242b0aa.jpg)\r\n\r\nOnce loaded, the GUI ran fine in my tests, with an additional reaction latency of ~400-500 ms with console commands like getbalances or getwalletinfo when the commands were run on big wallet. The other commands, and clicking on and opening transactions, ran basically as fast as they do with tiny wallets.\r\n\r\nWith one build on Debian, I did see the GUI halt, and then crash with segmentation faults, when loading any wallet at all. However, rebuilding after make clean solved that, so I suspect it was the build.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any suggestions for further tests to run with the big wallet, let me know.\r\n",
