Now it returns an error in such cases, and in\r\ncases were `importwallet` did not import any keys or scripts.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `importwallet` to log the number of keys and scripts imported, and logs a warning if the footer (`# End of dump`) of the wallet dump file is missing. If the file is missing the header (`# Wallet dump file created by Bitcoin`) or if no keys/scripts were imported, an RPC error is thrown. Functional tests were added to check for these two RPC errors.\r\n\r\nAll new error messages indicate to the user that files created by `dumpwallet` must be used instead.",
