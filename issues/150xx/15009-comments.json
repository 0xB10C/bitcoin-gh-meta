You've NACK'ed a bunch of useful PRs (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue/pull/11#issuecomment-419453702, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14164#pullrequestreview-153596070, etc) because you believe the upstream should be jgarzik/univalue without once giving a justification of why that should be.\r\n\r\njgarzik/univalue appears to be very infrequently maintained. There haven't been any code changes since August, and a request to add a 1.0.4 release (prompted by you here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12666) has been [unacknowledged since August 21st](https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue/issues/54).\r\n\r\nSwitching to having our own repo was a pragmatic decision to avoid relying on a spottily-maintained single-maintainer repo, as Wladimir rightly points out here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14882#issuecomment-449001484.\r\n\r\njgarzik does not appear to be interested in actively maintaining his repo. Why should we add that dependency and demand that he maintain it for us?",
