Specifically:\r\n* for each transaction you compute the bitcoin-days-destroyed\r\n* divide it by the average UTXO entry age weighed by amount (around 800 days currently)\r\n* the result is a value in BTC; take some configurable fraction of it (0.5% for example)\r\n* treat the result as extra fee (which gets divided by the tx size to obtain the feerate).\r\n\r\nThis is simple (don't bother recalculating this equivalent fee on every mempool change; just infrequently in the background or even not at all and keep using the value from entry time), and using 0.5% as factor would give a 250-byte 1 BTC-day-destroyed transaction (the limit for high priority earlier) the equivalent of 2500 satoshi/kB feerate boost.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that it has no guarantees on how much a miner could lose by using this approach. For example, 100 BTC of 1 year old coins would be treated equal to a 1 BTC fee. We can cap the maximum amount of feerate replaced, but that may make the scheme pretty useless if the cap is easy to hit.",

I sort of assumed there was enough hashpower mining with priority, since last time I checked estimatepriority was still giving meaningful results for low-ish blockheights, but I haven't done any kind of real analysis.",

However I think we backed ourselves into a bit of a corner by not more clearly communicating and building consensus that priority based transactions were going away before now.   \r\n\r\nWe can of course still do that, but I don't like releasing a 0.12 which breaks priority before that has happened.  If we had no choice, then thats one thing, but if a few peoples time to review this code is all it takes to avoid that scenario, we should avoid it.   \r\n\r\nWe need to make an analogous decision with respect to #6357.  If we're ok making miners who are using priority space only care about the starting priority of the tx for filling that space (the same way this pull uses that for eviction), then we can skip #6357, but otherwise we have to have it in order to speed up CreateNewBlock.",

      "body" : "@TheBlueMatt I may be crazy, but at least I know I can't predict the future accurately.  Right now there is no difference in income between reserving half the block for high priority transactions or reserving nothing.  If you drop the rest of the anti spam measures, e.g. by accepting dust outputs and other non standard transactions, you can make a few satoshis more.  Introducing bugs by purpose to make free transactions harder is premature at best.  If you want to remove the priority system, you should do it properly without introducing bug, and remove all references to priority and priority calculations, using fees only, and make 0 fee transactions non-standard.\r\n\r\nI don't think anyone expect free transactions to be mined in the first block.  bitcoin-cli estimatepriority 1 agrees with that, returning -1.  Unfortunately, due to the problem I mentioned above, bitcoin will generate free transactions with *much* lower priority than needed if the estimate returns -1.  I can make a pull request for that fix.",
