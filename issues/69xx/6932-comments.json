I thought it was important to actually test UpdateCoins instead of modifyNewCoins directly because it's how it is used that matters.\r\n\r\nThis test passes on master, passes on this PR, but fails when UpdateCoins is changed to just mark coinbases as un-FRESH but still skip the lookup (assuming the assert is commented out to permit this).\r\n\r\nHowever if #5967 is merged then the test passes once again.\r\n",
