It remains to be determined what the correct behavior should be.\r\nSee #6959 and comments [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6725#issuecomment-143855283) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6557#issuecomment-143367283), but it sounds like perhaps just improving the UI is the best answer rather than actually changing the behavior.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what we could do though is put a few checks in the wallet code to recognize a mempool limited situation and not generate free txs or txs of too little fee in that situation.  @sdaftuar any thoughts on that?",
