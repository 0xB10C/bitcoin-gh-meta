   "body" : "Some time after unlocking my bitcoin wallet for a transaction I checked the wallet lock status icon and the tooltip indicated that my wallet was locked and encrypted.\n\nBrowsing the bitcoin-qt.exe process memory using a tool such as HxD though, shows that part of the wallet password was still in memory.\n\nThis could potentially be an issue if a remote exploit is found in bitcoin-qt/bitcoind that allows a remote attacker to read the bitcoin-qt process memory. As a user I expected my locked wallet to not have its password exposed somewhere in process memory.\n\nIs it possible to clear all traces of the password in memory after use? I'm not sure how easy/feasible this is, just a thought.\n\nPlatform: Windows 10\nBitcoin Core Version 0.11.1\n",
