   "body" : "Based on #15681, this adds support for some simple cases of RBF inside of large packages. Issue pointed out by sdaftuar in #15681, and this fix (or a broader one) is required ot make #15681 fully useful.\r\n\r\nAccept RBF bumps of single transactions (ie which evict exactly one\r\ntransaction) even when that transaction is a member of a package\r\nwhich is currently at the package limit iff the new transaction\r\ndoes not add any additional mempool dependencies from the original.\r\n\r\nThis could be made a bit looser in the future and still be safe,\r\nbut for now this fixes the case that a transaction which was\r\naccepted by the carve-out rule will not be directly RBF'able",
