   "body" : "Follow-up in the set of Chain interface refactoring, it builds on top of #15713 and #15931 to finally remove `Chain::Lock` interface.\r\n\r\n`Chain::Lock` reason was mostly a temporary interface to help separation of Wallet from Node (#10973) without modifying behavior of legacy wallet code relying on chain state. It was a relief of review burden in the aforementioned separation PR, at the cost of keeping synchronicity between Wallet and Node execution. \r\n\r\nCaching more state in CWallet (#15931), let us remove the more used calls like `getBlockDepth` and move toward a more asynchronous interface. The current PR 1) move all remaining Chain::Lock methods to simple one and ensure `cs_main` lock is taken inside the interface 2) remove locking of `cs_main` inside any wallet code, which is another asynchronicity gain.\r\nLock order has to be swapped atomically at once to avoid potential deadlock issues raised by thread sync verification stuff.\r\n\r\nSome future works which would enhance Chain interface:\r\n* move `ScanForWalletTransactions` and most we can of rescanning logic on the node side,  would let us remove directly methods like `guessVerificationProgress` or `getBlockHeight`, meanwhile relieving of the the hardship of multiple simultaneous rescanning processing\r\n* split `listsinceblock` into a wallet part and node one, #15931 caching block height in tx, I think that's possible\r\n* move fee estimation queries to a notification interface and let the wallet cache it, fee estimation being driven by node mempool, wallet should be the consumer\r\n* obviously remove the RPC specific methods by letting the wallet processing RPC requests without going through the node, need to add `--server`  and `--rpcserver` options\r\n\r\nPrior PRs should be reviewed first before this one. Then to review the present PR, most of getting right the move is ensuring any `LockAssertion` in `Chain::Lock` method is amended as a `LOCK(cs_main)`. And in final commit, check that any wallet code which was previously locking the chain is now calling a  method, enforcing the lock taking job. So far the only exception I found is `handleNotifications`, which should be corrected.",
