Making `wait=false` the default makes `unloadwallet` pointlessly difficult to use, and inconsistent with other methods, including closely related methods like `createwallet` and `loadwallet`.\r\n\r\nIf you think there is reason to support `wait=false`, I think you need to say what the use-case is, and why it wouldn't be better served by having the client make a fully asynchronous JSON-RPC request, instead of using this half-asynchronous/half-synchronous `wait` option that doesn't (I guess?) block on acquiring `cs_wallet`, but does block on the network connection and on acquiring `cs_wallets`, and on whatever the UI currently does in `NotifyUnload` (or will do in the future).\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to keep the `async=false` option, it would be good to have a test to ensure that it doesn't acquire `cs_wallet` and `cs_main`. This would be easy to write as a c++ unit test which acquires the locks in one thread and calls `unloadwallet` in another.",
