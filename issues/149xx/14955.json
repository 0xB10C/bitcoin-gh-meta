   "body" : "This does not remove OpenSSL, but makes our own PRNG the 'main' one; for GetStrongRandBytes, the OpenSSL RNG is still used (indirectly, by feeding its output into our PRNG state).\r\n\r\nIt includes a few policy changes (regarding what entropy is seeded when):\r\n * All GetRand* functions seed the stack pointer and rdrand() result (in addition to the performance counter).\r\n * The periodic entropy added by the idle scheduler now seeds all entropy sources (incl. perfmon, openssl, hwrand, osrand) in addition to just a sleep timing.\r\n * The entropy added when calling GetStrongRandBytes no longer includes the once-per-10-minutes perfmon data on windows (it is moved to the idle scheduler instead, where latency matters less).\r\n\r\nFinally, an extra strengthening/benchmark step using repeated SHA512 is added, called from the idle scheduler.\r\n\r\nThe interface of random.h is also simplified, and documentation is added.\r\n\r\nThis implements most of #14623.",
