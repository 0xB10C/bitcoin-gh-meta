Compiling (with wallet, no-gui), running the unit/functional tests, running the binary and syncing for a while.\r\n\r\nI've posted a `Vagrantfile` which \"wraps up\" the vm configuration, installing dependencies etc [here](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/tree/master/vagrant) if anyone is interested. It's a fairly easy way to get a test environment setup quickly. I'll add more box definitions while testing rc1.\r\n\r\n@Sjors I've updated your comment to include the link to the rc1 binaries.",
