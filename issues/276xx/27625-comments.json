I was about to suggest that in that case it seems sufficient to only put `BLOCK` (maybe also `CONFLICTED`/`REORG`) transactions into `mapRelay` (keeping their mempool timestamp, to avoid adding ones that are older than 15 minutes). However, I think your point also applies to `REPLACED` transactions, because we'd still want to relay them, so that they are rejected by the peer and end up in their `AddToCompactExtraTransactions`? I wonder if it makes sense to drop a line or two of documentation here. (Edit: Or maybe even a test, if we want to get extra fancy)",

And if you use separate and dedicated size limits for `mapRelay` and the mempool, it might be easier to keep them separate data structures? ",

      "body" : "> > we could trim mapRelay before their scheduled expiry time has actually been reached.\r\n> \r\n> Sounds like this would either degrade compact block relay when the mempool is full due to trimming `mapRelay`, or turn one DoS (OOM) into another DoS (lost fee income) due to trimming valid mempool txs? And if you use separate and dedicated size limits for `mapRelay` and the mempool, it might be easier to keep them separate data structures?\r\n\r\nThe memory usage of `mapRelay` depends on whether the transactions in it have been removed from the mempool -- if you've got 15k txs in `mapRelay` but all of them are in the mempool, then that's likely using up ~1MB; but if 50% of them were removed from the mempool and each `CTransactionRef` is using up 1kB, then that's more an extra ~15MB. You maybe get the latter scenario if you're relaying a lot of RBF txs. So I don't think you can sensibly put a figure on how much memory `mapRelay` is using if you don't track the relationship.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the advantage of linking the two together for limits is that if you start trimming the mempool because `mapRelay` is too large, then you're increasing the mempool minfee, which reduces the RBF headroom -- instead of being able to RBF 50 times from 10 sat/vb up to 60 sat/vb, you might only see and relay 40 RBFs, from 20 sat/vb up to 60 sat/vb, which then reduces pressure on `mapRelay`.\r\n\r\n> What is the benefit of `mapRelay` overlapping with mempool?\r\n\r\n(a) We want things to expire from `mapRelay` based on when we first announced them, not when we first received them or when we evicted them, so that's extra data to store.\r\n\r\n(b) The number of txs we announce in 15 minutes is (currently) relatively tightly constrained (35tx every 2s for outbounds over 15min is ~16k; chance of >20k in 15min is about 1-in-5M).\r\n\r\n> If the main reason is transactions that could be in blocks, it seems reasonable to cap it at just a few thousand entries?\r\n\r\nWith RBF, you could have many different variants of a single tx, each relatively likely to make it into a block depending on when the miner picked the block template, so I think the time-based cap makes sense.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think there's a strong reason for the expiry duration to be 15 minutes rather than something shorter -- that was just left unchanged in #16851 when `mapRelay` went from being the only way to find a tx to just being the way to get at txs that are new to the mempool.",
