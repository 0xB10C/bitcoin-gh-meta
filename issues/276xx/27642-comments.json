It looks like the reason I was seeing it was due to a higher `rpcthreads` setting, but I'm sure I'm not the only one that has that sort of config and they may be dealing with the same issues.\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that if in fact the performance impact is \"small or absent\" in bitcoind then this is a sensible default for linux machines.",
