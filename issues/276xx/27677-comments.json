Here's the transcript of the above mentioned presentation: https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-04-25-mempool-clustering/\r\n\r\n It's also worth noting that although this proposal introduces a new limit, for the cluster size, it could potentially supersede some other limits (e.g. `-limitancestorcount`, `-limitancestorsize`, `-limitdescendantcount`, `-limitdescendantsize`) if the maximum cluster size is large enough. Though if the limit is in vbytes, then someone assuming a limit in count might still hit a non backwards compatible policy limit.",
