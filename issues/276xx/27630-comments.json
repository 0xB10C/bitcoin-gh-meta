For example, what would happen during a mempool storm like we had this past week, if only a portion (e.g. 50%) of the network upgrades to this patch? Would that increase the load on the nodes that are still clearing their relay queues at only 7 tx/s (ignoring #27610 here)?",

The 7 sounds lower\r\n  than it really is because received advertisements need\r\n  not be sent, and because the aggregate rate is multipled\r\n  by the number of peers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn alternative - or complimentary; it's not incompatible - approach I had in mind was to randomly drop half of `m_recently_announced_invs` if it exceeds some maximum size (e.g. 30 minutes at max throughput). This essentially splits the load between peers during moments of peak throughput, without permanently dropping much. This could be done _after_ we constructed the next `INV` (which already filters some stuff we don't need anymore).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat worries me about just increasing the tx relay rate is that it increases the total worst-case bandwidth on the network.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, not increasing it could mean that your mempool can't keep up with the next block if it only has a single peer. That in turn would hurt (compact) block relay. But for outbound we already allow double the rate, and we always try to have 8+ of those. So I'm not sure if that's really a problem.",
