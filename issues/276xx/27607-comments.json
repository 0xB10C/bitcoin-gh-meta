      "body" : "Thanks for the deep review @ryanofsky!\r\n\r\n> Reviewed [86752e0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/86752e0cc5bc48f3d4ac1cd07835c37daf078d6a) and it mostly looks good, but does have a null pointer deference currently (see comments and suggested fix). I like this PR because it will simplify #24230 and could potentially improve performance. I'm not actually how sure how much it actually would improve performance in practice though, so I'm curious if that's was the original motivation here or if this is related to one of your other changes.\r\n\r\nYeah, the motivation came from a mix of thoughts actually.\r\n\r\nI was reviewing #24230 and wasn't completely sold by the `hasDataFromTipDown()` call inside the `attachChain` function. It seems odd to call to a chain data verification function in an event registering method.\r\nThen went deeper over the function, realized about the work duplication, and took that argument to simplify #24230 a bit.\r\n\r\nWe could also move the entire `hasDataFromTipDown` from the interface to somewhere else in this way. So there is no `CBlockIndex` dependency in the interface neither here nor in the #24230 intermediate commits.\r\n\r\nPlus, It plays well with #25193.\r\n\r\nAnd.. I'm also thinking that after #24230 and the parallel sync work (#26966), we could have one initial sync thread with a workers pool for all the indexers instead of the current per indexer sync thread.\r\nWhich should speedup the sync process quite a lot. We are currently reading the entire chain block by block from disk on every index thread. So instead, we could read blocks just once, then dispatch events to the indexers. Making indexers purely listeners with no associated thread.\r\n\r\n>  I'm also curious about the todo:\r\n> \r\n> > Pending todo: Fix remaining test by using the block index map instead of the active chain. The active chain is not available at the point where the indexers are started.\r\n> \r\n> Unsure if this is just referring to the null pointer problem, or to something else\r\n\r\nYeah ok. That comment is inaccurate and I forgot to update it.\r\n\r\nI initially thought that the issue was due an initialization ordering, that we werenât having the active chain activated at that point (thought that was done only post load-blk thread completion).\r\nSo I implemented 4738a1d7d46a9dd1f12dfeb047b142ab33c0fa16 and 837acfdbaca430cc5e29b7cdbf61380c33ed1aa2 instead of the current version. Which is better than what we have here currently, but itâs not the solution for the null ptr deference.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that empty indexers donât set the best block to the genesis `CBlockIndex`, they just leave it null. So, the index summary returns a valid height=0 with an empty block hash.. which crashes on the block hash assertion.\r\n\r\nSo, the fix is easy. But.. I havenât done it because have found another possible index sync \"fatal error\" in master and wanted to fix it prior continue moving forward here.\r\n\r\nEssentially, we are not checking whether the node has the post fork point blocks in disk prior starting the index:\r\n\r\nThe pruning violation checks whether we have blocks from the fork point up to the active chain tip. But it does not check if the node has blocks from the fork point up to the fork tip.. which are required by coinstatsindex to reverse its state during the reorg..\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\nActive chain\r\nA -> B -> C -> D -> E\r\n\r\nIndex chain\r\nA -> B -> C -> G -> F -> H\r\n\r\nThe âfailure errorâ will happen when G or F are not in disk or were pruned.\r\n\r\nSo, if this happens, it causes a âfatal errorâ during the coin stats index reorg process due the impossibility to read the block from disk.",

So there is no `CBlockIndex` dependency in the interface neither here nor in the #24230 intermediate commits.\r\n\r\nYes I don't think it makes sense to expose that method as part of the `Chain` interface, and even if it did make sense, it wouldn't make sense to put the implementation in the `ChainImpl` class, because the class is mostly meant to hold glue code, not complicated functions. That's the reason for the suggestion to make it a standalone function `bool ChainDataFromTipDown(ChainstateManager& chainman, const CBlockIndex& start_block)` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27607#discussion_r1191396717\r\n\r\n> And..

So instead, we could read blocks just once, then dispatch events to the indexers. Making indexers purely listeners with no associated thread.\r\n\r\nYes letting indexes just receive notifications to get in sync and not have to implement sync logic is the goal of #24230. And the threading issue should be orthogonal after that PR. Indexes (and wallets) could read and process blocks in single thread, or read blocks in a single thread and process them in parallel, or read and process blocks in parallel like happens currently, or use some other form of scheduling. But regardless of what ordering is used, the interface an individual index uses to get in sync should not have to change, and indexes shouldn't have to create sync threads or deal with race conditions between the notification threads and sync threads.\r\n\r\n> I initially thought that the issue was due an initialization ordering, that we werenât having the active chain activated at that point (thought that was done only post load-blk thread completion).\r\n\r\nOh, I see. That's also what I concluded from seeing the failure, but I guess it is not the complete picture.\r\n\r\n> The issue is that empty indexers donât set the best block to the genesis `CBlockIndex`, they just leave it null. So, the index summary returns a valid height=0 with an empty block hash.. which crashes on the block hash assertion.\r\n> \r\n> So, the fix is easy.\r\n\r\nI didn't know about this. I guess the fix would be to treat the genesis as the fork point in this case. And to consider the index already synced if there is nochainstate and the genesis pointer is null.\r\n\r\n> But.. I havenât done it because have found another possible index sync \"fatal error\" in master and wanted to fix it prior continue moving forward here.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would be a good thing to fix this. But this sounds like something that was already broken, so I'm not sure if the fix has to be bundled here, necessarily. I think the \"has data from tip down\" check is a useful check that can run early and warn if any block data is missing. But if the check isn't perfect and doesn't catch missing block, it shouldn't be the worst thing because the missing blocks will just be reported later rather than earlier.",

I didn't look very deeply but I would probably make Init() a public method and call it after constructing the index. Also stop calling Init() from Start() and move the RegisterValidationInterface() from Start() to Init().",

So it is basically reimplementing #25193 in a different way that doesn't require a `sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500))` waitloop. I think this approach is cleaner, but also that #25193 is a smaller more targeted change with a test, so I would probably prefer to see #25193 merged first and with this cleanup and rewrite merged later.\r\n\r\n~#25193 also has two ACKs, so I can re-ack and merge it soon.~ EDIT: Never mind, just noticed it needs rebase currently\r\n\r\nOn this PR, I like the approach and thinks the code looks pretty good overall. The only thing I don't like is all the complexity added to AppInitMain(). I think that complexity could go away if you got rid of the `std::set<BaseIndex*> indexers` local variable there and added a `NodeContext` `std::vector<BaseIndex*> indexes` member instead. Then there would be no need for the `func_start_indexes` lambda. The lambda could be replaced with a regular `StartIndexes` function instead.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "Was about to send the updates comment hehe. I was too tired last night to write it. Thanks for the review ryanofsky!\r\n\r\nUpdates list:\r\n\r\n- Decoupled index `Init()` from `Start()`. So indexers can be initialized without spawning the sync thread. \r\n\r\n- Simplified the pruning violation code by re-purposing the `GetFirstStoredBlock` function. Now called `IsBlockDataAvailable`.\r\n\r\n- Fixed a small race, where we set the index `m_synced` flag (which enables `BlockConnected` events) before calling to the child class init function. So, for example, the block filter index could theoretically process a block before initializing the `next filter position` field and end up overwriting the first stored filter.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\n\r\n> Looking at current version of the PR [6dfec1b](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/6dfec1b5fbb0f8e95a6134ea8b27e9d6c285d171) it seems to have changed a lot, and the other thing it is doing now is delaying startup of indexes until blocks are loaded, so there is no longer a conflict with `reindex-chainstate`. So it is basically reimplementing #25193 in a different way that doesn't require a `sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500))` waitloop. I think this approach is cleaner, but also that #25193 is a smaller more targeted change with a test, so I would probably prefer to see #25193 merged first and with this cleanup and rewrite merged later.\r\n\r\nYeah, I updated the PR description last night stating that this is now built on top of #25193 (but my slightly modified version of it https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25193#pullrequestreview-1375021974).\r\n\r\n@mzumsande said that he was going to give them a look and probably take them. So, all good if them get squashed there or here. Either way is fine for me. Happy to re-review #25193 whenever is ready to go again.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n> On this PR, I like the approach and thinks the code looks pretty good overall. The only thing I don't like is all the complexity added to AppInitMain(). I think that complexity could go away if you got rid of the `std::set<BaseIndex*> indexers` local variable there and added a `NodeContext` `std::vector<BaseIndex*> indexes` member instead. Then there would be no need for the `func_start_indexes` lambda. The lambda could be replaced with a regular `StartIndexes` function instead.\r\n\r\nSounds great. Was also thinking about moving the lambda to a standalone function but wasn't finding the right place and didn't want to create a new file only for this.\r\n\r\n",

I don't see m_synced getting set to true before the index is synced, and don't understand the block filter index example.\r\n\r\nSure. The [BaseIndex::Start()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6cc136bbd36f859a16e469bb5c016d06c19bcd50/src/index/base.cpp#L401) flow in master is the following one:\r\n\r\n1) Calls `RegisterValidationInterface()` --> which registers to the validation interface.\r\n2) Calls [BaseIndex::Init()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6cc136bbd36f859a16e469bb5c016d06c19bcd50/src/index/base.cpp#L409) --> which, prior the pruning check, sets [m_synced](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6cc136bbd36f859a16e469bb5c016d06c19bcd50/src/index/base.cpp#L109):\r\n    `m_synced = m_best_block_index.load() == active_chain.Tip()`\r\n3) Calls `CustomInit()`.  --> which, for the block index filter, initializes the [m_next_filter_pos](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6cc136bbd36f859a16e469bb5c016d06c19bcd50/src/index/blockfilterindex.cpp#L114) field with the db information.\r\n\r\nSo, if the block filter index is synced, and the index receives a `BlockConnected` event after finish point (2) and before point (3) then `m_next_filter_pos` will not be initialized, so `BlockFIlterIndex::CustomAppend()` will use a null `m_next_filter_pos`.

I would say this PR fixes a race condition where an index's  `CustomAppend` method might be called before its `CustomInit` method, causing the index to try to update itself before it is initialized. And that the PR fixes the problem by always setting `m_synced` to true until after `CustomInit` is called, instead of before.

Or are there other benefits to this commit?\r\n\r\nAside from the cleaner code (which I think that it's salable on its own), I see maintainability and test coverage benefits with the global flag removal. Also, the indexes threads active-wait isn't that good in terms of processors context switching (the index threads are waking up every 0.5s and the reindex process could take a while).\r\nPlus, since #25193, we skip the pruning violation checks prior reindex, while here we are recovering those checks too.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it's more accurate to conduct the pruning violations checks after the \"loadblk\" thread execution. This is because that thread imports data from external sources and activates the best chain (only there we know which is the node's best chain).\r\nMeaning that, with the current code, we could have performed the pruning violations checks on a fork chain if the import thread encounters another best chain (and not perform any pruning check on the real active chain). Which could lead to a similar situation as there would be no init error if something isn't correct after thread import execution.\r\n\r\nSaid that, talking about the init returned error, maybe we could cache the node shutdown reason and return it even if the error was post-init?. Will give it a look.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I'm thinking the PR is doing a lot of things and maybe it would be good to split into smaller PRs where possible. Especially if the smaller PRs can be unambiguous improvements.\r\n\r\nYeah sure.\r\nI usually try to not split a PR too much (when it's scoped under a certain area) to not loose review power and coordinate better between ourselves but.. I agree that this started targeting something and now grew up a bit longer.",

Is my understanding correct that this race cannot actually happen in practice on master right now, because the indexes are set up (`Init()`) by the init thread, which starts the networking and loadblk threads only later - so I can't see from which other thread `BlockConnected` signals could come from at this stage. However, once index initialization is deferred to the loadblk thread in ca3041984cf3665e27b6783c923ab1c32682500a, I think this race could easily happen. \r\n (this might affect the decision whether backport is necessary).",

I mean, at least for me, it seemed good to let us verify that the conciser pruning violation code doesn't introduces any behavior changes first (at this point reviewers should be ok with the \"new\" process), then move that to init and call it with the the oldest indexer block index (which is the behavior change).\r\n\r\nBut let me know if this doesn't makes sense for you, and you still prefer the all-in-one way.

(Per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27607#discussion_r1198184049 discussion).\r\n\r\n* Moved the `LoadMempool()` call from the blockstorage import function to init.cpp (per https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27607#discussion_r1199824807 discussion). So the indexes can be started prior starting the mempool (which could take a while) and we donât keep a mempool related function inside `blockstorage.cpp`.\r\n\r\n* Decoupled the uninitialized index child class race condition into an standalone PR #27720.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a missing init return if `index.Init()` fails.\r\n\r\n* Renamed `IsBlockDataAvailable` to `CheckBlockDataAvailability` and added the missing data availability check for the upper block (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27607#discussion_r1199268910).",

I agree `ImportBlocks` would be a slightly better name than `ThreadImport`, but I also think `ThreadImport` is fine.

Previously they ran on the main thread before loadblk thread started, now they are running **on** the loadblk thread, after importing blocks and before loading the mempool. Is it a good thing to delay the index Register and Init calls? Is it good to move them from the main thread to the loadblk thread? It seems like it would be pretty easy to keep those calls where they are and still get rid of the `g_indexes_ready_to_sync` variable, so what is the motivation for changing the behavior here?\r\n\r\nThe change seems reasonable to me, but the description is vague and it's not clear how exactly behavior is changing and why the behavior change is good, or neccessary.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Looking at later commit \"refactor: index, decouple 'Init' from 'Start'\" (9f38c2ffba87ea07c0eeb9975ad4d84ae716f9aa), I can see that the behavior change here actually gets reverted later and is unnecessary. I would suggest moving that commit before this one so this one only removes the `g_indexes_ready_to_sync` variable without affecting other behavior.",

I wonder if simplifying Init is the real motivation for the change at this point, or if this is also used for something else later. Would be helpful if commit message had a sentence about the benefit / motivation.\r\n\r\nAlso commit message should be updated to mention `CheckBlockDataAvailability` instead of `IsBlockDataAvailable`.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be good to have a simple unit test for the `CheckBlockDataAvailability` function in `blockmanager_tests.cpp`. Even if the unit test doesn't cover all the edge cases, having it would be useful to show  `CheckBlockDataAvailability` makes sense as an API and is testable\r\n\r\nEDIT: Now that I've reached the last commit of the PR  \"index: verify blocks data existence only once\" (ce5f798b089dc8051f6b414ce1a606e60c85d7f3) I can see that the motivation for commit is to be able to help make index startup more asynchronous, avoid repeating work when multiple indexes are enabled in the followup commit.

Sorry for that. I updated that commit description in a rush..\r\n\r\n> Also renaming ImportBlocks to ThreadImport here makes it hard to see where the real changes are in this commit. I agree ImportBlocks would be a slightly better name than ThreadImport, but I also think ThreadImport is fine. What's more misleading than the function name is the thread name \"loadblk\", so if you do want to do a renaming, I'd suggest renaming both loadblk and ThreadImport in a separate scripted diff commit not mixed with more substantive changes.\r\n\r\nYeah ok. Agree.\r\nHave renamed \"loadblk\" to \"post_init_load\" but I'm all ears if you have a better term for a thread that imports/load blocks, the mempool and starts indexes.

The goal of having the condition is to skip checking code and avoid the prune_violation error below if `-reindex-chainstate` is used, but `!LoadingBlocks` will still be true if `-reindex-chainstate` is used. Definition of `LoadingBlocks` is `m_importing || fReindex` but `m_importing` is guaranteed to be false here because the `ThreadImport` thread is not created at this point. And the `fReindex` global is only true if `-reindex` option is used, not if `-reindex-chainstate` option is used.\r\n\r\nI think the most straightforward thing to do in this commit is just to get rid of the `while (!g_indexes_ready_to_sync)` loop in `BaseIndex::ThreadSync` but leave the `g_indexes_ready_to_sync` variable alone everywhere else. Then get rid of `g_indexes_ready_to_sync` later when it is safe to eliminate, probably in the last commit \"index: verify blocks data existence only once\" (3514f768b181d359d0218845ace0266d37e9dfbd",
