It gives you a way to manually specify which transaction output to decrease in order to increase the fee.\r\n\r\nFor fixing the root issue and determining the right change output, there are various possibilities. Sipa's proposed future design for wallet pubkey storage would start explicitly recording whether a key is intended to be used for change or payment (https://gist.github.com/sipa/125cfa1615946d0c3f3eec2ad7f250a2#future-design). Even without this, for hd split wallets (#9294), existing key metadata could provide this information.",
