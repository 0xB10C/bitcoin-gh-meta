Even without this, for hd split wallets (#9294), existing key metadata could provide this information.",

When I run `bumpfee` on this transaction, Bitcoin Core doesn't know which output to take additional funds from. You are saying it will add another input if necessary, but that's not what we want here. We want to reduce one of the two outputs so that more goes to mining fee. This is a very common scenario when one of the outputs is a genuine payment and the other is a self-transfer, e.g., to cold storage.",
