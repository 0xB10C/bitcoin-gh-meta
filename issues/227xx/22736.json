   "body" : "To enable lock contention logging, `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` has to be defined at compilation. Once built, the logging is not limited to a category and is high frequency. With these factors combined, it seems likely to be rarely used.\r\n\r\nThis patch:\r\n- removes the conditional compilation directives\r\n- adds a `lock` logging category\r\n- reduces the amount of logging per lock contention from 2 lines to 1\r\n- allows lock contentions to be logged on startup with `-debug=lock` or at run time with `bitcoin-cli logging '[\"lock\"]'`\r\n\r\nI've tested this with Clang 13 and GCC 10.2.1, on Debian, with and without `--enable-debug`.",
