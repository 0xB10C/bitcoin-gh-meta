      "body" : "ran this a few times locally and it passed, so it looks like the mempool sync is taking extra long? i replaced `self.wait_until` locally with a call to `self.sync_mempools` (as that seems to be the actual purpose of the wait until?). ran 10 times without any failures.\r\n\r\nlooking at `sync_mempools`, tho, it would still be at risk of a timeout error: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b935abb9eb2eeaceb5621e110e1889c2ce1b7734/test/functional/test_framework/test_framework.py#L662-L665\r\n\r\nbut i think the error message and the use of `sync_mempools` makes it more clear in the logs what exactly went wrong and makes the intent of the test more clear. happy to open a PR for that if it would help, but perhaps there is a better solution that would completely eliminate the risk of a timeout?
