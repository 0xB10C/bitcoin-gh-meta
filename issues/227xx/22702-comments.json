Or just over-allocate?\r\n\r\n`MemoryResource::AllocateNewBlock` is the only place where I actually malloc a new block that's divided into the chunks. Here I've replaced the `::operator new(num_chunks* m_chunk_size_bytes)` with `::alligned_alloc(sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE), num_chunks* m_chunk_size_bytes)`. And use `free` in `~MemoryResource`.\r\nI also changed the default allocation size `m_block_size_bytes` from 262144 to `sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)`. \r\n\r\nSo for node size of 104 bytes and page size 4096, this should allocate a page-alligned block with 39*104=4056 bytes.",
