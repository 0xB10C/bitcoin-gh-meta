   "body" : "@jamesob has benchmarked my rebased branch (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16801#issuecomment-895348607) concerning the allocator for node based containers, and has seen a 9% speedup along with 8% reduction in memory. That's why I had another good look at my previously closed PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16801 and updated the code. I've updated the code quite a bit, mostly trying to simplify it and improve correctness:\r\n\r\n* Renamed classes to be more in line with naming used for the`std::pmr` allocators (see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/polymorphic_allocator)\r\n* Simplified `Allocator` thanks to being able to use C++17 behavior (`std::allocator_traits`)\r\n* Simpler allocation: only allocate blocks of the same size and just keep them in a `std::vector`.\r\n* Only access memory when actually needed. E.g. Linux uses optimistic memory allocation, so memory pages from malloc are only actually made available to the program when accessed\r\n* Correctly handle alignment for the inplace linked list.\r\n\r\n@jamesob it would be great if you could run your benchmarks again with the updated code. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
