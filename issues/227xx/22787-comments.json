We use the (common) convention of putting `const` to the left of the thing that's const, except in the case of a const pointer to type (`T* const`) where the const needs to go to the right of the `*` to indicate that it's a const pointer rather than a pointer to const.

FWIW, I think the notation for smart pointers:\r\n\r\n- `const std::shared_ptr<T>` \"constant shared pointer to mutable T\"\r\n- `std::shared_ptr<const T>` \"mutable shared pointer to constant T\"\r\n\r\nis a bit easier to read than for raw pointers:\r\n\r\n- `const T*` \"mutable pointer to constant T\"\r\n- `T* const` \"constant pointer to mutable T\"\r\n\r\nThis is also similar for STL containers:\r\n\r\n- `const std::vector<T>` - constant vector of Ts\r\n- `std::vector<const T>` - mutable vector of constant Ts",

Changing the style just in this case would be inconsistent and confusing.\r\n\r\nI can easily move the `const` to the left-hand side. We are definitely not consistent with putting it on the left, as you can see all the cases of wallet const shared pointers right now (search for `std::shared_ptr<CWallet> const` in the code base for an example).\r\n\r\nThat's not what my PR is about though: it's about putting `const` inside the shared pointer, which is a feature that is supported, and that makes the thing inside it immutable, which is what you expect when you see the const sign. You do not expect to be able to call destructive methods or delete things inside a wallet that is marked `const`, which you can do with the above shared pointer.\r\n\r\n> Hopefully now that this has bitten you once, you'll not get tripped up by it again.\r\n\r\nIt is definitely not the first time it's bitten me, personally, but maybe I'm just slow. :)\r\n\r\nEdit: it bites me often because I keep thinking of a `const std::shared_ptr<X>` as having a `const X` inside of it, due to it being `const`, but in reality it's simply a shared pointer that cannot be e.g. `.reset()`.",
