Once you make the identity expensive to obtain, you can then use fraud proofs - for instance rather than having an expensive UTXO commitment system and associated soft-fork you can just as easily ask nodes to make signed statements as to what transactions match a given filter, and if a different peer gives a different answer, construct a compact proof that one of them was lying and thus destroy that identity. This will work particularly well in conjunction with micropayment systems for SPV node services.",
