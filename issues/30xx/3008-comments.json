Converting everything to BTC makes things like artificial priority modifications, perhaps due to an out-of-band fee payment promise or just because the tx one of yours, easier to reason about as well.\r\n\r\nAnyway essentially all of this stuff is us saying \"We know the technical limits are 1MB/10minutes, but we know there isn't actually that much genuine blockchain demand yet so we'd rather set artificial limits so we don't waste our startup capital on spam too soon.\" Not to mention that we really want people to get used to the idea that transaction have some kind of cost associated with them, however minor, so apps and business plans aren't written with bad assumptions baked in.",

I updated the first commit with your suggestion, and added comments on two places in the code that can be simplified once the network upgrades.\r\n\r\n@petertodd : I think you're confused by the code that avoids creating a free transaction with a change output less than 0.01.  The edge case is a user who creates a high-priority transaction (maybe a 10 BTC, well-aged input) with a sub-CENT output (maybe they're sending 0.001 BTC, so have a 9.999 BTC change output) during the transition period when most of the network hasn't upgraded to 0.9 yet. The first version of this pull would send that without a fee, and their transaction would likely never confirm.\r\n",
