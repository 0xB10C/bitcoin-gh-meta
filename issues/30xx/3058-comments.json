The bitcoin network itself already provides the required service.  ... it's also not that urgent anymore, since UPNP provides it in cases where the host is behind nat and gets the address via UPNP and the externalip argument provides it in cases where users have manually configured it.\r\n\r\nI posted a for-comment patch a while back: http://people.xiph.org/~greg/extip.patch\r\n\r\nBut I need to do more testing of it before I can propose merging it.\r\n\r\n",
