There are sites which rely on the \"address(es) the input coins to a transactions were previously sent to\", which is well defined, but not generally available, relies on address reuse, and makes assumptions about the sender software (in general, it only works if the sender himself received coins on a standard address, in a wallet that isn't shared with anyone else).\r\n* If you need a more automated way of dealing with this, wait for the payment protocol which will be available in an upcoming versions, which allows transactions to be negotiated directly between sender and receiver before being broadcasted on the Bitcoin network. It means you can add identities, messages and other metadata like refund addresses to transactions, without burdening the Bitcoin network with this private information.",
