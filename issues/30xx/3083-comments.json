      "body" : "There's two improvements here.\r\n\r\nThe first is just a cleanup. The CBlockLocator datastructure is part of the P2P protocol (so something very basic), but its methods directly refer to some of the validation engine's globals. That's really ugly, as a user of that class you won't expect that using some of its methods imply you need to do locking on cs_main, or that it would depend on global data in the first place. In short, it doesn't belong there - and now that we have a CChain data structure that explicitly encapsulates the block chain, it's much more natural to ask the chain \"give a locator that points to you\", rather than asking locator \"make yourself into something that points to... well, you know\". The advantage is really just making the code easier to understand and reuse.\r\n\r\nThe second is an actual performance improvement. Currently, when constructing a CBlockLocator, we iterate the entire block chain index in memory (just benchmarked that, takes ~20ms), just to find the few ones we need. Since we have CChain that allows looking up entries by height, this becomes trivial (i expect a few microseconds). 20ms may not seem much, but we do this any time we're asking for blocks from a peer, and it's really just silly not to use the height-index now that it exists.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It also reduces the number of lines of code!",
