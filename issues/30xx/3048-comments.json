I'm working on \"pythonizing\" it further to make using it more Pythonic, see my pythonize branch: https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/tree/pythonize Jeff has said that he sees my work as the direction the library will go in the future, so feel free to write code against it; that branch isn't going to be rebased prior to merging at this point.\r\n\r\nA small and easy to understand example of it being used for a real-world task is my dust-b-gone program: https://github.com/petertodd/dust-b-gone\r\n\r\nHope that helps!",

Actually, this is only command that I feel necessity to use (so something in the GUI is missing). When coin control will be released, I think that this will be solved definitely.\r\n\r\nPeter, thank you for interesting branch, I look into it deeper.\r\n\r\nSo thanks again, problem is solved for me :-)",
