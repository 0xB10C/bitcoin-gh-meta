A workflow of \r\n\r\n1) fill in label\r\n2) fill in amount (optional)\r\n3) click \"Make payment request\"\r\n4) show  the new receiving address that can be copy/pasted as well as a QR code and Bitcoin: URI\r\n\r\nIt is then made clear to the user that he should give this address to the person that wants to send him coins. \r\n\r\nListing the current receiving addresses is secondary; it could remain at the bottom of the tab, or behind a special menu item.\r\n",
