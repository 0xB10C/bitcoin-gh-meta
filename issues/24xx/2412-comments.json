I think this name makes more sense and is more consistent with naming of other functions. 2) SetNetworkActive() prints log ouput if fDebug is set, 3) ClientModel now has a method to control network activity state setNetworkActive(). This is used by RPCConsole. 4) The string in RPCConsole is the same as the string in the status bar tooltip so they can share translations.\r\n\r\nI'll look into the rest of the suggestions on the gui later.",
