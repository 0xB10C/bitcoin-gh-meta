   "body" : "This change addresses a race condition where setnetworkactive=false wouldn't always disconnect all peers.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the following could happen:\r\n1. Thread A -- Begins connecting to a node.\r\n2. Thread B -- Sets kNetworkActive=false and disconnects connected nodes.\r\n3. Thread A -- Finishes connecting and adds node to list of connected nodes.\r\n\r\nThe node that was connected from Thread A remains connected and active,\r\neven though kNetworkActive=false.\r\n\r\nTo fix the race, disconnections when kNetworkActive=false are now handled in the main network loop.\r\n\r\nfixes #13038",
