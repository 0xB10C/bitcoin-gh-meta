   "body" : "As discussed in #13023 I've split this test out into a separate pr\r\n\r\nThis test (and documentation update) makes explicit the guarantee (previously undefined, but implied by the 'SingleThreaded' in `SingleThreadedSchedulerClient()`) - that callbacks pushed to the `SingleThreadedSchedulerClient()` obey the single threaded model for memory and execution - specifically, the callbacks are executed fully and in order, and even in cases where a subsequent callback is executed by a different thread, sequential consistency of memory for all threads executing these callbacks is maintained.\r\n\r\nMaintaining memory consistency should make the api more developer friendly - especially for users of the validationinterface. To the extent that there are performance implications from this decision, these are not currently present in practice because all use of this scheduler happens on a single thread currently, furthermore the lock should guarantee consistency across callback executions even when callbacks are executed by multiple threads (as the test does).",
