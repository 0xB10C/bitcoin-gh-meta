   "body" : "It has been brought up to my attention that current random delays mechanism (originally intended to obfuscate transaction metadata) allows to easily estimate the time a transaction was received by a node.\r\n\r\nIt may be done by connecting multiple observer nodes to the same node. Each of those nodes will generate its own schedule of delays. Combined metadata regarding those events from different sources allows an observer to estimate transaction time.\r\n\r\nThis patch is not a perfect solution, but it attempts to increase the cost of such an attack by assigning delays to network groups, not separate nodes. After this patch, an attacker will have to run nodes in different network groups to gather required metadata.",
