The very least that could be done is a proper exiting window informing the user that a call is still in progress (or at the very least document this somewhere if it isn't already?).\r\nThe way that it is now (see image) it looks like the software isn't working anymore (\"Not responding\") which will probably result in users trying to forcefully close it. This might lead to other unexpected issues (e.g., need for a reindex?). ",
