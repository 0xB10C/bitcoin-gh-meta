Instead, a minimum value will be enforced on the custom fee input box.\r\n\r\nBefore, a user could enter a fee below the minimum required fee but upon pressing send the resulting transaction would still pay the minimum fee. Now, if a user enters a value below the minimum fee the custom fee input box will be set to the minimum fee.\r\n\r\nWhere the checkbox used to be, there is now a more general warning about low fees. The tooltip is still the same as before.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39350803/40269185-e042d560-5b7a-11e8-873e-649d4bef5150.png)\r\n",
