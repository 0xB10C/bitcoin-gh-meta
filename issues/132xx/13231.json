I don't really use the GUI so I'm not sure if this happens in other places.\r\n\r\nHere is the screenshot of both boxes when inputting the number `15`:\r\n![screenshot from 2018-05-14 10-23-23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5016303/39989540-c9c82bc0-5759-11e8-8341-1981626b1a1b.png)\r\n![screenshot from 2018-05-14 10-23-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5016303/39989541-c9e95188-5759-11e8-8790-45ebadfbc4c7.png)\r\n**note: just in case somebody wonders, the global dark theme doesn't make a differente on this; same behavior with light/default patterns.*\r\n\r\nMy expected behavior is that, at least, I can see the most significant digits in the amount and, at best, I can see it all when space allows it. \r\nWhat is happening is that I input `15` and unnecessarily end up seeing `5.00000000`.\r\n\r\nI can reliably reproduce this on v0.16.0 (and master) running on a Fedora 27 using GNOME 3 and qt5.\r\nTried it on an colleague's OSX and could not reproduce the issue; the input seemed fine.",
