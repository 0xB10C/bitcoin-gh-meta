In the case of logging, I've set it to block and wait for capacity instead of dropping messages. Does this seem right?\r\n[JN] I think there are at least three options here:\r\n    1. overwrite existing data\r\n    2. drop new messages\r\n    3. block\r\nI'd go with (2), but push a final message to the ring buffer saying `Logging buffer full - dropping new log messages`, and then when the ring buffer is accepting messages again, push a message saying `Logging buffer accepting new messages`. That makes it very clear to anyone reading the log that messages were dropped between timestamp A and timestamp B.",
