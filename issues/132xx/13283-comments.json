The goal was that users would never be exposed to the concept of weight (which governs consensus rules), and could just continue using (v)bytes.\r\n\r\nAll fee logic uses vbytes for that reason. This does not only apply to `minRelayTxFee` but also prioritization, dust logic, transaction replacement, ... I don't see how there is a problem with that. It could be changed, but it would be a pretty invasive thing.",
