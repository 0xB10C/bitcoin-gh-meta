   "body" : "This adds a new wallet RPC call `listsincetx` that allows to list follow-up transactions (in order / `wtxOrdered`) from a specified transaction.\r\n\r\nIf the latest transaction was used as base-point for finding follow-up transactions and the long-polling timeout if set greater then zero, it will wait until new transactions has been found or the timeout has been expired (http push channel). Used together with a https proxy, one can build a very robust wallet transaction push channel (that can bypass NATs, proxys, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis does allow to build a wallet-notify push channel without keeping client-states on the server side.\r\nIt does also allow clients to effectively sync the transaction list.\r\n\r\nA client can simply loop over `listsincetx(<newest_known_txid>, 30/*timeout*/)` and will immediately get new txns once they arrive.\r\n\r\nMitigates #13237 \r\nRelated #7949\r\n\r\nThis (or a similar) approach was once discussed during an IRC meeting (can't find it anymore in the logs).\r\n\r\n* [ ] Needs release notes\r\n* [x] Needs wallet notify example python script",
