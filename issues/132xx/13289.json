   "body" : "`tr()` requires a `QTranslator` to be installed for it to translate, but we can't setup the args after setting up the `QTranslator` as setting that up requires looking up a command line argument. So instead we setup the arguments with the default text (`tr()` will resort to the default), then get the language to setup with and create the `QTranslator`, then clear the arguments and lastly setup the arguments again. The second arguments setup will allow the arguments to be translated with the `QTranslator`.\r\n\r\nNote that the contexts for some of the translations changed after #13190 so translations are not available for some strings where translations were previously available. Fixing that requires a translation resource update.\r\n\r\nFixes #13287",
