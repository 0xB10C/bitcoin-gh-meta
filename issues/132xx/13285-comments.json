But I think that's a minor drawback, and not having another list of tests (even if autogenerated) may well outweigh it.  This certainly solves the main issue I'm interested in, which is the manual ordering in the list.\r\n\r\nI currently don't have time (nor do I want to step on your toes here) to implement the full set of metadata mentioned in #11964, though.  So I would only include the rough runtime in the tests to make the order automatic (i. e., the order in `test_runner.py` itself won't matter and can be based on logical relation of tests rather than runtime).  I would not implement the full set of metadata to get rid of the list completely for now.  Do you still think that's worthwhile for now, or do you just want to implement the full solution yourself instead?",
