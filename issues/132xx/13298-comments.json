The rational being that relay of novel transactions blinds tracking (since we won't relay something a peer gave to us back to them) and also lazy tracking stuff tends not to relay anything.   Delaying tx relay to a peer that never sends anything would hardly hurt propagation in the network, but at least might force attackers to be a bit more useful.\r\n",

      "body" : "@skeees Putting all in one will result in more spiky bandwidth usage (e.g. you hit your queue then use a bunch of bandwidth transmitting to everyone at once),  and I _believe_ but lack a rigorous analysis that we get more privacy for a given amount of average delay if the transactions diffuse randomly in the network to hide where they originated from, at least if we assume the target doesn't send many transactions (and that an attacker isn't abusing multiple groups to get a faster effective send.)\r\n\r\nE.g. imagine a user who originates from node X and an attacker that connects to almost all nodes in the network.  If all sends happen at once, when the attacker sees a transaction happen from X first then he can have some confidence that transactions happened from there.   If the send times are independent and the attacker sees a transaction from X first he doesn't learn that much from that transaction.\r\n\r\nThe issue becomes if the attacker connects to you 20 times and the times are independent than he gets effectively a 20th of the delay.  Which is why I was suggesting leaving outbounds independent and putting all inbounds into a single group or a small number of groups. ",
