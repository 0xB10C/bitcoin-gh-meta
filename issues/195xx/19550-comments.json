I think this can be helpful for many users, especially since there are some new index candidates coming up (#14053, #18000) that can give a quick overview without the user having to parse the logs.\n\nFeature summary:\n   \n   - Adds new RPC listindices (placed in Util section)\n   - That RPC only lists the actively running indices\n   - For each index it gives the name, whether it is synced and up to which block height it is synced\n\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\n\nÂ Â https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19550\n\nCommit Summary\n   \n   - rpc: Add listindices\n\nFile Changes\n   \n   -  M src/index/base.cpp (9) \n   -  M src/index/base.h (9) \n   -  M src/rpc/misc.cpp (46) \n   -  M test/functional/rpc_misc.py (10) \n\nPatch Links:\n   \n   - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19550.patch\n   - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19550.diff\n\nâ\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\n  ",
