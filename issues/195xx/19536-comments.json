At this stage I also don't think this should be a blocker for 0.20.1.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing with @hebasto I gather it's restricted to Linux-only, and is somehow related to the xcb QPA plugin. I had a quick look through the qtbase 5.9.8 source, and my assumption is there maybe a dependency like QFileDialog -> QFileSystemModel -> QFileSystemWatcher which may not be completely `#ifndef QT_NO_FILESYSTEMWATCHER`'d out, or which is not possible to break, as it seems that QFileSystemModel may try and use QFileSystemWatcher for caching.",
