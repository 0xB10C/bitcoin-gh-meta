(i.e. I intentionally give a function an argument with the wrong type and MyPy still passes every file)  Have you been able to?\r\n\r\nRegarding your concern [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19389#issuecomment-659054074) that this isn't python 3.5 compatible, I don't think you have to worry.  The only parts that aren't compatible are the `.pyi` files, but that's ok, they're only used by MyPy.  I've tested running `lint-python.sh` under python 3.5 and it doesn't give any errors.  (MyPy does, however, get confused and tell me that a couple lines are wrong when they aren't.  It doesn't seem related though).",
