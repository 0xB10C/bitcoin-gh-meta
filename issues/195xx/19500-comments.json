      "body" : "The downside of this request as phrased is that you end up with an additional end user tunable with no particular guidance on how to use it.  There is nothing wrong with it otherwise, but I think sumbtc's issue is more a symptom of the eviction logic being tor blind when it shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly concerning because tor peers are latency and reliability disadvantaged so on a mixed network host they're not likely to win at any of the anti-eviction criteria.  That's an oversight.\r\n\r\nI think that at a minimum the eviction logic should be made onion-aware by adding a step before the size()/2 longest uptime peers that protects the size()/4 longest uptime localhost peers, and then subtracts what it protected from the number of longest uptime peers it protects... so still half longest uptime, but up to half of those from localhost even if they weren't the longest uptime overall.\r\n\r\nOne could go further and split other criteria the same way, but I doubt its worth the complexity to go that far, maybe just the blocks criteria if someone wanted to go further.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
