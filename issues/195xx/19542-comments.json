(Assuming no other changes to the pulls in question happened in the meantime).\r\n\r\nAs to the conceptual discussion, I think everyone agrees with @theuni that connman should be treated as an optional pointer. In current master, connman is a pointer (and it is not trivially possible to make it a non-pointer). https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c04485850e72e773280e0cc8d88e73ec791bef73/src/node/context.h#L36\r\nAlso, places where connman could be nullptr properly check for that. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c04485850e72e773280e0cc8d88e73ec791bef73/src/rpc/mining.cpp#L640-L642\r\n\r\nHowever, the lines changed by the patch are called only where connman is already confirmed to be not null. If we go ahead to merge this, it would be good to document in the code or somewhere else why those cases should be treated as pointers and, at the same time, why nullptr checks are not needed for them. \r\n\r\nACK 1aff21b36450644390d6361d496811dda5a6ae31 for now. I only checked that it cleanly reverts, but ideally we'd have clear documentation on how to pass connman around and why. Sorry for causing this disagreement in the first place. I wish the time spent on this was used on user-facing changes, but properly documenting this will hopefully avoid misunderstandings in the future.",
