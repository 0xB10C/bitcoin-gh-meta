Updating the `AX_GCC_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE` macro reintroduced the checks for `protected` and `internal`, which had been removed in ee64c53c1fdcadf00138b7e6fdf44a1c433db9f8. However I take it for the past 4 years, no-one has built and used a libbitcoinconsensus for a Darwin target, with `--enable-reduced-exports`.\r\n\r\nThe alternative approach here would be to re-remove the two visibility attributes we don't care about from the `AX_GCC_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE` macro (rather than 7a600331a84fa7da0759f89deb309e60e5040773, 1381e9c8d327a86cbb5d2405d24b7ddd5b26fcd5 and 01bc0b6ca2b7b2d2b384f667e2abe7f1a7b9c8a5), noting that we've modified it from upstream, and then remove the unused visibility check from #4725. In that case, the remaining changes would still be relevant improvements.\r\n\r\nBig anti-props me.",
