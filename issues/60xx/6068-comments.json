      "body" : "Sorry for this little change, but...\r\n\r\n@thuni was concerned about introducing globals in policy.h\r\nfIsBareMultisigStd can be easily turned into an attribute later as shown in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/compare/policy_new...jtimon:policy_moveonly (in fact it could be done more easily not moving AreInputsStandard at the same time as IsStandardTx)\r\nBut minRelayTxFee is in many more places, and after proposing some changes to #5159, I am no longer convinced that I want to move things like IsDust to policy directly. One possibility would be to put all the fee policy stuff in the estimator. Then an interface of the estimator can be returned by CPolicy, for example, making a CPolicy::GetFeePolicy() analogous to CChainParams::GetConsensus().\r\nThe minimum fee can still be configured from the constructor of CStandardPolicy but it can pass it directly to the estimator without storing it redundantly.\r\nIn that case some files could be dependent on policy/fees but not in policy/policy (just like some functions depend on Consensus::Params but not on CChainParams), then some of the 5 includes I just removed would have to be changed for policy/fees later.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons I'm keeping minRelayTxFee in main for now.\r\n\r\nMoving minRelayTxFee to policy/policy could still prevent it from depending on main temporarily when IsStandardTx is moveonly, but it doesn't seem to be worth it.\r\n",
