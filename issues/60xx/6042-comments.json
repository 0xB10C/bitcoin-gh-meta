Their value is increased when a\ntransaction is received with an address associated with the account. Their\nvalue is decreased when a sendfrom RPC is issued or using the move RPC.\nUsing normal sendtoaddress or sendmany will *always* debit the \"\" account.\nThis is a frequent source of confusion, and the account system is being\ndeprecated for this and other reasons.\n",
