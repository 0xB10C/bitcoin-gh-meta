As discussed on IRC it could be possible to have something like `bitcoin-cli -w getnewaddress` (-w stands for --wallet which would send the commands to `/wallet`). Unclear for now is how it would handle json type conversion (minor issue IMO).",

This PR changes that model, without apparent need.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem to make sense to add another level like this, when you can easily just add new methods.  Convention \"mining.$name\" or \"wallet.$name\" can easily suffice, and registered services/plugins may be triggered there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
