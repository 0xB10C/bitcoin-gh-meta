On POSIX systems, messed up environment settings can cause a failure ([Python test](https://gist.github.com/dexX7/ab3f7411a9040e96d55c)).\r\n2. During the deinitialization, an internal facet pointer of `boost::path` is deleted, and if `boost::path` was not initialized by the main thread, it causes failures such as #3136 (and related).\r\n\r\nThe current situation:\r\n\r\n1. As default, the \"C\" locale is used.\r\n2. On POSIX systems, the environment locale is used (via `std::locale(\"\")`).\r\n3. On POSIX systems, to detect bad environment settings, an exception thrown by `std::locale(\"\")` is caught.\r\n4. On POSIX systems, and if there are bad environment settings, the \"C\" locale is used as fallback.\r\n5. As workaround, to explicitly force the initialization of the internal facet pointer by the main thread, `boost::filesystem::path::imbue()` is called.\r\n6. Bad initialization of `boost::filesystem::boost::path` can result in exceptions, which are currently not caught.\r\n7. On Windows systems, the \"C\" locale appearingly does not cover the whole character set, which can result in (6), as shown by #6078.\r\n\r\nIn practise, the current 0.10.1 can result in a failure on Russian (and other) Windows, and earlier versions are affected by the deinitialization issue, resulting in faulty Boost test executions, as well as other failures during the shutdown, such as the crash reported in the context of rebuilding the block database.",
