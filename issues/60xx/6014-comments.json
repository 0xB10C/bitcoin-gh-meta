      "body" : "Have you measured that this improves your propagation time more than just\nconnecting to a few fast peers? By the time you have sent out your block to\n100 well-connected peers, the last ones to get it likely could have already\ngotten it from eachother faster than from you, as more fast peers means you\nsuddenly need to do a lot more work to keep up with the sudden burst of\nnetwork packets to broadcast the block.\n\nIn any case, I do not think this serves the best interests of users of the\nsoftware. We have had several cases of people thinking that more\nconnections means faster confirmations of their transactions, or \"better\nvalidated\" blocks.\n\nIn the past we have also seen problems with the network running out of\nconnectable slots, so we have actively avoided options for people to\noverwelm the network with connections. I'm very aware an attacker could do\nthis anyhow, but this is more about preventing people from hurting the\nnetwork while incorrectly believing it benefits them (for non-miners, a\nsingle connection to a non-compromised is as good as any higher number).\n\nI believe this equally would not actually benefit you.\n",

      "body" : "Pool servers typically are run from datacenter grade gigabit connections or better so I don't think bandwidth is that big of an issue most of the time. My pool server with nearly 6000 active miner connections is normally running at under 5% CPU usage total for all applications at nearly any time, this includes bitcoind, stratum server, database, web front end and relay node. I don't really see what type of resource bottleneck I would be running into.\r\n\r\nUnless a pool server is expected to run with 8 or less connections total I think that increasing the max outbound to match the max connections would help ensure that the pool is only connecting to well connected nodes rather than nodes behind NAT that would propagate slower(more hops required). The other issue is that even when allowing inbound connections it is difficult to reach the the default max of 125. I haven't been able to test this myself but I don't see why this change wouldn't help. When starting up a pool server it takes a long time to start getting more connections than the initial 8.\r\n\r\nI agree this option could cause problems if too many people enabled it, but I think we need a better solution than just hard coding the outbound connection count to be 8(I think hard-coding arbitrary variables is a bad idea). Do you have any ideas on how one might go about making this option hard for people not running pools to enable? I don't want to maintain a fork of bitcoin just because someone decided to hard code one variable. Maybe force the user to add \"-isweariamactuallyrunningaminingpool\" to their config in order to enable this option.",
