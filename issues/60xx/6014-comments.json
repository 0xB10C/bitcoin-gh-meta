      "body" : "Have you measured that this improves your propagation time more than just\nconnecting to a few fast peers? By the time you have sent out your block to\n100 well-connected peers, the last ones to get it likely could have already\ngotten it from eachother faster than from you, as more fast peers means you\nsuddenly need to do a lot more work to keep up with the sudden burst of\nnetwork packets to broadcast the block.\n\nIn any case, I do not think this serves the best interests of users of the\nsoftware. We have had several cases of people thinking that more\nconnections means faster confirmations of their transactions, or \"better\nvalidated\" blocks.\n\nIn the past we have also seen problems with the network running out of\nconnectable slots, so we have actively avoided options for people to\noverwelm the network with connections. I'm very aware an attacker could do\nthis anyhow, but this is more about preventing people from hurting the\nnetwork while incorrectly believing it benefits them (for non-miners, a\nsingle connection to a non-compromised is as good as any higher number).\n\nI believe this equally would not actually benefit you.\n",
