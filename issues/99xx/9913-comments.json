A first time user clicks 'OK', expecting something to happen, but the dialog disappears and nothing happens. Repeat the clumsy scanning. You are supposed to copy/paste the contents from the dialog box (or hit edit and get it from the textarea used to encode QR codes).\r\n\r\nUsual features as opening an encoded url or performing registered actions don't exist (edit: it might exist, but it is not easy to discover how it works). Copying is the only thing you can do. That isn't so bad, but then it should simply do that or give you a button to do it instead of manually selecting and copying it.",

It's a lighter dependency as well because it only does image processing on top of [QtMultimedia](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtmultimedia-index.html) which, in turn, handles the camera(s) in a platform-independent fashion (tested this on Linux, macOS, Android). Like others have commented the real problem is introducing a new dependency in an orderly fashion and getting a deterministic binary built.\r\n\r\nI think launching an external app to scan the QR is an attack vector. It is safer and better UX to have this integrated.",
