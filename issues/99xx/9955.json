   "body" : "Segwit's version bit will be signalled for all invocations of CreateNewBlock,\r\nand not specifying segwit only will cause CreateNewBlock to skip transactions\r\nwith witness from being selected. (Note that CreateNewBlock's performance may suffer if the mempool has witness transactions that are being skipped, so this is not a recommended configuration.)\r\n\r\nOriginally we didn't signal segwit unless the getblocktemplate caller explicitly indicated support, in order to prevent segwit from activating before any miners actually had support for the witness commitment.  Now that many blocks are signalling segwit already, this is not a material concern.\r\n\r\nAlso, I need to figure out how to add a test to segwit.py to check that witness transactions would in fact be skipped.\r\n\r\nAs per IRC discussion, I think we should consider this for backport to the 0.14 branch.",
