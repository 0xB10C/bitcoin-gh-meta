The solution there is to quickly merge the typo reported/PRed.\r\n\r\nThat's just not going to work. Quickly merging encourages bombarding even more of these. We just don't have the resources to handle this, and the overhead for a github PR is too large, they are supposed to be for major, self-contained changes.\r\n\r\nWhat we could do is create a tracking PR:\r\n\r\n- Assign one person as \"typo fixer\", and have them open a \"report typos here!\" PR\r\n\r\n- People can report typos, or patches fixing a typo in that PR.\r\n\r\n- The typo-fixer pulls these suggested changes (or any typos they find themselves) into their PR.\r\n\r\nThen once in [some period of time] this pull is merged.\r\nThis allows live cooperation on fixing typos without involving the maintainers at every step.",
