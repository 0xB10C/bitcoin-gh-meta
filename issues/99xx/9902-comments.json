Hopefully std will have some other (possibly saner!) way to achieve the same. \r\n\r\n> When we do our own implementation, it'd be really nice if we could be strictly compatible with std::filesystem, not because we're necessarily moving to it any time soon, but because it gives us a strict api to follow.\r\n\r\nYes, `std::filesytem` makes a more sensible target for that than `boost::filesystem`. Although I'm not sure it makes much sense to do our own (general, cross-platform) implementation if it's going to be in the standard library in a few years. Specific implementations for specific sandboxing environments would ofcourse make sense.",
