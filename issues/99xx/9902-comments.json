Not tested much, but I don't think behavior should differ at all.\r\n\r\nI wanted to see how compatible this would be to working with the std::filesystem spec, so I tried it out. It's pretty close. The changes needed are here: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/filesystem (I didn't attempt to build qt, though). The one outlier is boost::filesystem::path::imbue(). I'm not sure what to do about that, so I left it alone.\r\n\r\nWhen we do our own implementation, it'd be really nice if we could be strictly compatible with std::filesystem, not because we're necessarily moving to it any time soon, but because it gives us a strict api to follow.",

I'm not sure what to do about that, so I left it alone.\r\n\r\nFor boost that imbue hack is necessary to get paths with international characters working. Hopefully std will have some other (possibly saner!) way to achieve the same. \r\n\r\n> When we do our own implementation, it'd be really nice if we could be strictly compatible with std::filesystem, not because we're necessarily moving to it any time soon, but because it gives us a strict api to follow.\r\n\r\nYes, `std::filesytem` makes a more sensible target for that than `boost::filesystem`. Although I'm not sure it makes much sense to do our own (general, cross-platform) implementation if it's going to be in the standard library in a few years.",
