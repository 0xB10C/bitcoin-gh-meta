PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5872, but I can't understand what's going on in there...\r\n\r\nThis feels like a hacky work-around, but it fixed the problem I was having (compiling in OSX 10.10.5) if there were spaces anywhere in the absolute path of the source code. Successfully compiled and passed all rpc-tests in paths with and without spaces. \r\n\r\n[GNU Make with spaces in filenames seems to be a general issue.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9838384/can-gnu-make-handle-filenames-with-spaces)\r\n\r\nI will continue to bang on this and see if I break anything else.",
