      "body" : "> This makes invocations easier to read especially if booleans or lots of arguments are involved.\n\nConcept ACK. Though I think we don't need named args for calls that\nonly have a single and obvious param, such as generate( $num ) or any\nsingle param call that starts with set*.\n\nTo aid reviewers even more, maybe in future pulls, a project wide\nsearch and replace of eligible calls makes sense. Potentially one s&r\nper commit, but no strong opinion on this.\n\nOn Mon, Mar 13, 2017 at 9:54 AM, Wladimir J. van der Laan\n<notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> Convert selected tests to use named arguments in RPC calls.
