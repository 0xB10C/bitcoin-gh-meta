Normally it's set up to go as fast as possible so also will ask as much from your system as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are a few options to tweak this. For example with `-par` you can lower the parallelism of validation, if you set that to 1 (thread), it will sync slower but put less load on the system.\r\n\r\nAlso in your OS you can lower the I/O and CPU priority of the process.\r\n\r\nAfter the client catches up it should back down, though, except momentarily when a block comes in.",
