Disabling http keep-alive option alone will not prevent from dead-and-open connection because the implementation currently uses the blocking `getline()`. If a malfunction client is not sending a valid http request, it can end up with a never closed connection until a restart of bitcoind.\r\n\r\nBut right, the keep-alive option is questionable. I assume most RPC connection are coming from localhost or LAN. IMO there is no big benefit of saving http overhead with keep-alive. Therefor i can ACK disabling keep-alive in general or over the flag.\r\n\r\nBut still there is a need for implementing a non-blocking way of handling connection with a proper http timeout according to #5526 (see @jgarzik info there).",

Hopefully the client issues are also solved by that time, but it's not necessary as we'll be robust against them.\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli Probably because there was no testing suite for RPC back then.

I also initially created this a a default no change in behavior in the interest of being conservative, but unfortunately; you can't tell if it's the broken persistent connection support thats breaking you: it just looks like Bitcoin core is unresponsive. \r\n\r\nIn the future if a commit fixes a problem it would be helpful if it were mentioned in the commit message. \r\n\r\nThe last round of changes that impacted our persistent connections was a massive regression which caused complaints from many users-- many more than the time_wait complaint. Apparently after our failure to do anything about it many people just stuck on 0.8.1. This is particularly problematic because some of the most frequently impacted parties were miners. I've also been told at conferences by various service providers that they'd switched to using hosted APIs due to Bitcoin core being unresponsive, which made no sense to me at the time. In the new light of being reminded why miners were staying stuck on 0.8.1, it finally does make sense.\r\n\r\nI'm open to having persist default to on (after all, that was my original PR),  but I think that doing so may be a mistake unless we really have reason to believe the timewait problems are more frequent than the others. I also think persistent connections are not the right solution for timewait in any case: isn't the correct solution SO_REUSEADDR?\r\n\r\n(I'm travelling today and won't be submitting any commits, so don't feel like waiting for me is required)",

I'm not making an argument if this is sufficient or not; just pointing it out: I wouldn't introduce a change in behavior like this without at least a switch to get the old behavior back.\r\n\r\nWe have multiple reports that the software is unusable since 0.8.1. We got a rash of complaints even from the few who figured out what was up, to the point where people stopped complaining but stayed with old versions. Doing nothing at all isn't acceptable either.  It's not acceptable for us to do nothing. Again.\r\n\r\nSorry that I'm not maximally up to speed on the issues people saw with sockets in time_wait; it's not super well documented (even on that complaint) what the issue is:  My current understanding is that clients are making connections and closing them. They client's outbound socket sticks around in TIME_WAIT for two minutes (with common TCP settings).  If the client makes more than about 275 connections (32768 high ports vs 120 seconds) per second, they risk running out of ephemeral sockets toward the particular server address:port..   If so, I can see that behavior, but my quick test while on an airplane wasn't able to make enough requests per second to actually observe it running out.\r\n\r\nDo we have a reproduction?\r\n",

I was not aware that the other way around also could break clients. Thanks for pointing to the issue.\r\n\r\nHence, I'm fine with changing the default back to 1 for 0.10, and for master too. If this goes into the long haul, might as well fix keep-alive instead instead of having a phase where it's disabled by default.\r\nPeople experiencing issues can use `-rpckeepalive=0`.",
