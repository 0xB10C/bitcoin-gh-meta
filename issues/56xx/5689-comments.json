How about leaving it at the top for now and moving it to support/util when there's more stuff that can go there? For ex, we may consider moving random.o and other remaining openssl users into there, so that we have a more straightforward path to removal.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'm happy to move it to whereever you prefer.",
