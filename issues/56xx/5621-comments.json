Though, ... I'm not sure we should be using exceptions for critical failures while we are still using them for normal conditions. Eliminating them from normal conditions would require a substantial rewrite of the network deserialization code, so asserting on the critical failures is the thing to do if you buy into my argument that we shouldn't be mixing them.",
