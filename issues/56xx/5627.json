For instance with BIP19 if m != n invalid signatures need to be provided in the scriptSig; prior to this change those invalid signatures would need to be large DER-encoded signatures.\r\n\r\nNote that we may want to further expand on this change in the future by saying that only OP_0 is a \"valid\" invalid signature; BIP19 even with this change is inherently malleable as the invalid signatures can be any validly encoded DER signature.\r\n\r\nCC: @sipa ",
