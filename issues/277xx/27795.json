Hex integers/data can be prefixed with `0x` to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nWhen scripts are decoded into ASM, two different integers can be displayed identically, with one as hex and the other as decimal. `decodescript 0511121314150457c74942` produces ASM of `1112131415 1112131415` , despite the integers being different. There is no distinction between hex and decimal. \r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nPrefixing `0x` makes the most sense to me.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nAll data could be provided as hex, or \"d\" could be added to decimals. Removing ambiguity is the primary concern here.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
