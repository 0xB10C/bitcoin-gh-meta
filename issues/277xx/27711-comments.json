Am I correct when guessing that any added EXIT* macro, and not the BUBBLE* macros are indicating a missing return?\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke Right, the `BUBBLE_UP` is kinda like a cast, it's not so interesting. The others introduce conditional returns to pass any errors back up the stack. So the problem cases are ones where we don't already have that behavior.\r\n\r\nThe main complication comes from the fact that the callstack might look like:\r\n```\r\nvoid foo()\r\n  int bar()\r\n    std::string baz()\r\n```\r\nWhere `baz()` returns a fatal error. The solution implemented here is to wrap everything in a variant:\r\n```\r\nMaybeEarlyExit<void> foo()\r\n  MaybeEarlyExit<int> bar()\r\n    MaybeEarlyExit<std::string> baz()\r\n```\r\nWhere: `MaybeEarlyExit : std::variant<T, FatalError, UserInterrupted>` (and those are simple enum classes)\r\n\r\nSo basically if the call resulted in an error, pass an error type back up immediately rather than a real return value. These [macros are defined here](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/1fb1e7c632ccf5cd9e8a64cccfa490c688e3dbaa) and do that as necessary (you can largely think of them of different notations of try/catch/rethrow). In fact, this model forces that invariant: you get a return value or a fatal error but never both.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[BlockManager::WriteUndoDataForBlock](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1#diff-114c2880ec1ff2c5293ac65ceda0637bf92c05745b74b58410585a549464a33fL718) is a good example of correct/incorrect:\r\n- FindUndoPos: potential error caught and passed back up (what callers do with it is a different question)\r\n- UndoWriteToDisk: aborts and returns immediately as needed\r\n- [FlushUndoFile](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1#diff-114c2880ec1ff2c5293ac65ceda0637bf92c05745b74b58410585a549464a33fR738): this one is (I believe) an example of a missed return in master that could cause problems with changes like these. Not necessarily this one in particular, but it's clearly not alone. Edit: to be clear, the problem here is that `FlushUndoFile` may call `AbortNode`, but we don't react to that in `WriteUndoDataForBlock`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to proceed. @ryanofsky mentioned maybe fixing them up as part of this shutdown callback effort?",

Changing `FlushBlockFile` and `FlushUndoFile` to send a different \"flush failed\" notification rather than \"fatal error\". The node's KernelNotifications handler could treat this just like a fatal error to keep current behavior the same. Other applications using libbitcoinkernel might choose to handle the error in a different way for example by sending a notification or trying to free up disk space, rather than shutting down the service right away.\r\n2. Changing `FlushBlockFile` and `FlushUndoFile` to return `[[nodiscard]] bool`, and changing calls to these functions either bubble up the error or have comments about why the error is safe to ignore in that particular context.",

If I am writing an application which uses libbitcoinkernel, the thing I would want from the kernel library is a cancel() function I could call to cancel potentially slow operations. I don't want to have to mirror my application state to an `atomic<bool>` and be give the kernel read/write access to the bool as a more awkward way of cancelling.\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me the approach here is not very friendly to potential libbitcoinkernel applications, and is not even very friendly to our own application since it exposes the fRequestShutdown global more broadly and makes it harder to get rid of.\r\n\r\nI think a better approach would be to get rid of the `fRequestShutdown` global and replace it with a `CThreadInterrupt cancel` member in `kernel::Context`. I think this should not be too hard to do, and would still be compatible with most other changes in the PR.",

But an error flushing state in memory to disk does not need to be fatal, as long the state in memory is kept and can be saved later. There are lots of ways an application could handle a failed flush notification, and I think it would be better to avoid using fatal error callback for any notification that does not have to be fatal.\r\n\r\nThe choice of whether to use separate methods or enums is basically just aesthetic. And I didn't dig into whether these particular flush errors need to fatal or not. I think you can decide what to do here or whether to do anything at all. My reason for suggesting \"flushFailed\" as an alternative to \"nodiscard bool\" was that latter change might be more invasive and require changing more sensitive code.",

      "body" : "> One of my goals for this PR here is to stop the kernel relying on code that handles platform-dependent blocking while still being signal-aware (e.g. the bulk of what is currently in shutdown). I don't see why such logic should exist in a standalone kernel library. Do you have a different perspective here?\r\n\r\nYes, I don't think we should do this because it gets in the way of the kernel having a nice and future-proof API.\r\n\r\nI think we both agree that applications using libbitcoinkernel should have a way to cancel long running kernel threads and operations from an outside thread or signal handler. My [branch](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/review.27711.1-edit) provides that functionality though a [`SignalInterrupt`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/cf326d0a42eadff811d466a84cbdd626f39c9d86/src/kernel/context.h#L21-L22) object that sits in the `kernel::Context` struct. By contrast, the [current PR](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/commits/a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5) uses a `std::atomic<bool>` object that application needs to initialize itself and pass to the library.\r\n\r\nI think the approach in the branch is better for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- Using an `SignalInterrupt` object instead of an atomic bool provides a more future-proof API. It is true that right now, all the code running in the kernel can just get away with polling a bool every once in a while to decide whether to continue executing. But we don't know that this will be true in the future. If future kernel code wants to use a thread pool or some other asynchronous processing, there should be a way for outside code to _actively_ send an interrupt and cancel that processing, not just passively set a bool and require the kernel to poll for it. Supporting active cancellation should not require a change to the kernel API when we can just define the API in a general way without reference to `std::atomic<bool>` right now.\r\n\r\n- The API in the branch is friendlier than the API in the PR. Adding the interrupt object to the kernel::Context struct is nicer than requiring the application to initialize the interrupt object itself. Not every application needs to cancel kernel operations (bitcoin-chainstate.cpp is one example) so requiring those applications to declare an atomic shutdown variable adds boilerplate and complexity. You could address this by moving the atomic bool into kernel::Context. But even with that change I still think SignalInterrupt interface is cleaner than the atomic bool interface.\r\n\r\nI understand the approach in the PR makes kernel a littler smaller and lightweight, but to me overhead of depending on CThreadInterrupt, TokenPipe, SignalInterrupt, and unistd.h does not seem high enough to worry about. Also, whatever overhead there is here is an implemention detail of the kernel, and can be changed later. It's not something that's hardcoded into the kernel API.",

      "body" : "> Thank you for your comprehensive answer. I think it boils down to: A fatal error should not necessarily have to trigger an interrupt for all kernel operations.\r\n\r\nYes, this is definitely a goal. Libbitcoinkernel should try to be a library, not an application or application framework. It should have a convenient way of cancelling operations and not force everything to use one shutdown variable.\r\n\r\nBut both the current PR and my branch do already support this. The main difference between the PR and branch is that the PR uses a `std::atomic<bool>` object, while the branch uses a `SignalInterrupt` object.\r\n\r\n> Going back to this earlier remark again, you declared the `m_interrupt` member in your branch as `const`. Do you think it is a bad idea to mutate it from within the chainman to forego a call to `StartShutdown`?\r\n\r\nIt's not necessarily bad, but it would be nice to avoid it. It would be cleaner if interrupt state cleanly represented whether a cancellation was requested or not, and wasn't also used to handle the `-stopatheight` and `-stopafterblockimport` corner cases.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I was thinking of suggesting dropping the last commit a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5 from the current PR, and leaving the two `StartShutdown()` calls in place for now. I think a better approach than calling `StartShutdown()` or calling `m_interrupt()` in those cases would be to just return \"finished\" or \"success\" status codes. Also in both cases, it would be better if the kernel wasn't deciding itself whether to return early, but instead asked the application through std::function callbacks. I.e. there could be a std::function callbacks for \"I just a new chain tip, should I keep processing or return early?\" that would be more general than having hardcoded `-stopatheight` logic in the kernel. The third \"FailedConnectingBestBlock\" shutdown case also seems like it should be returning a real error code to the application and calling fatalErrror, not just sending a shutdown notification.\r\n",

Rationale for each of these is provided in the commit messages.\r\n\r\nThese patches now went through quite some evolution in terms of their scope and intention. I am pushing this patch set to show how I'd currently unify the feeback received so far. In terms of next steps I'd like to lay out the following options:\r\n\r\n1. Get the current patch set through review, completing the goal of removing the `ui_interface` and some of the boost headers from the kernel. Complete step 2 of this phase of the kernel project. Add another step in this phase of the kernel project for strictly typing any functions that may cause an interrupt. My current thinking is to use @ryanofsky's #25665 extension of the `Result` type to return either a result or these fatal errors. Each instance of an interrupt call will be replaced piecemeal in separate PR's to allow for clean review. I found that some of these cases get quite complicated, meaning simply returning on a fatal error may lead to bugs if surrounding code is not also adapted, and catching all nuances in a single, sprawling PR is probably too burdensome. Eventually this should lead to code where we'd only have to trigger a fatal interrupt at the edges of the library, and otherwise just push fatal errors to code using it. \r\n\r\n2. Revert to a more minimal patch set, basically containing the new interrupt class + the `FatalError` wrapper to remove the `ui_interface`. Then proceed as in step 1.\r\n\r\n3. Close this PR, then proceed as in step 1. Once all fatal interrupt cases are handled, circle back to the kernel interrupt handling for long-running functions and conditional interrupts (in other words those lines of code that currently call `StartShutdown`).\r\n\r\nOption 1 is what seems pragmatic to me currently, option 2 would be closest to the goals as laid out in the kernel tracking issue (first cleave unwanted functionality / dependencies, then improve interfaces and fix weirdness discovered during development). Option 3 is where my heart is, even if it might block progress for some time and would depend on a bunch of other improvements to be completed first.",

      "body" : "Thanks for following up and incorporating the feedback! \r\n\r\nOn the topic of how to move forward with these changes, I think we should see if we can find a way to avoid making temporary changes to validation code that are not desirable for the long term. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Having `interrupt_on_fatal_error` and `interrupt_on_condition` ChainStateManager options which are complicated (and very confusing even to me!)\r\n- Giving ChainStateManager a mutable reference to the interrupt object instead of a const reference, and using the mutable reference to have it send interrupt signals to itself.\r\n\r\nIf temporary kludges are necessary to avoid having a PR that is too big to review, maybe that's a good tradeoff. But it would be better if we could see what the final code looks like before making that tradeoff. If this isn't possible, I think we should at least be able to add comments / documentation in the code saying which things are temporary and how they should be used in the meantime.\r\n\r\nIf you want to take time to iterate more on this code more, I think we could easily pull out parts of this PR right now that are pure improvements and could be reviewed and merged quickly. If you took the first commit here 8b3ac7d95253ac9c17faee3df29f11144e79f8b4 and the last two commits a4034e719c0dfa07bc8c267af3c2139d3b353757\r\nand bbfbcd0360e486d47025a412f2c0f4e8535ab255 that were previously part of #27636, I think we could quickly review and merge these in a separate PR as they are pure refactorings which do not change behavior or add temporary kludges to validation code.\r\n\r\nAfter that PR or alongside it commits 60f5461e160c4ef9aa5ee8e34f70a6459d12cae5 and 79b549abee60d13edcf8fe6a4c899c1b0bd08f88 from this PR also seem like good candidates for splitting off and being in their own PR so they could get more careful review as they do change behavior subtly.\r\n\r\nGreat to see more work here, though. I think there are still some tricky details to work out but most of the changes seem very good.",
