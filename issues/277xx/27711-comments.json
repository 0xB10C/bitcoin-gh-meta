Am I correct when guessing that any added EXIT* macro, and not the BUBBLE* macros are indicating a missing return?\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke Right, the `BUBBLE_UP` is kinda like a cast, it's not so interesting. The others introduce conditional returns to pass any errors back up the stack. So the problem cases are ones where we don't already have that behavior.\r\n\r\nThe main complication comes from the fact that the callstack might look like:\r\n```\r\nvoid foo()\r\n  int bar()\r\n    std::string baz()\r\n```\r\nWhere `baz()` returns a fatal error. The solution implemented here is to wrap everything in a variant:\r\n```\r\nMaybeEarlyExit<void> foo()\r\n  MaybeEarlyExit<int> bar()\r\n    MaybeEarlyExit<std::string> baz()\r\n```\r\nWhere: `MaybeEarlyExit : std::variant<T, FatalError, UserInterrupted>` (and those are simple enum classes)\r\n\r\nSo basically if the call resulted in an error, pass an error type back up immediately rather than a real return value. These [macros are defined here](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/1fb1e7c632ccf5cd9e8a64cccfa490c688e3dbaa) and do that as necessary (you can largely think of them of different notations of try/catch/rethrow). In fact, this model forces that invariant: you get a return value or a fatal error but never both.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[BlockManager::WriteUndoDataForBlock](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1#diff-114c2880ec1ff2c5293ac65ceda0637bf92c05745b74b58410585a549464a33fL718) is a good example of correct/incorrect:\r\n- FindUndoPos: potential error caught and passed back up (what callers do with it is a different question)\r\n- UndoWriteToDisk: aborts and returns immediately as needed\r\n- [FlushUndoFile](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/8054f8b204ae30c781768133da7e2b308e5b7ad1#diff-114c2880ec1ff2c5293ac65ceda0637bf92c05745b74b58410585a549464a33fR738): this one is (I believe) an example of a missed return in master that could cause problems with changes like these. Not necessarily this one in particular, but it's clearly not alone. Edit: to be clear, the problem here is that `FlushUndoFile` may call `AbortNode`, but we don't react to that in `WriteUndoDataForBlock`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to proceed. @ryanofsky mentioned maybe fixing them up as part of this shutdown callback effort?",
