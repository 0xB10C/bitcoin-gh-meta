To determine this currently, the user would need to parse the raw transaction data and iterate over the transaction inputs, and inspect their sequence number. This is not something I think it's reasonable to expect people to do. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like the `bip125-replaceable` field to indicate the RBF flag of the transaction, also after it has received confirmations. \n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
