   "body" : "Attempt to fix #27749.\r\n\r\nImplemented a `getblockfileinfo` RPC command to obtain block files related data.\r\nSo it can be used to fix the intermittency presented inside `rpc_getblockfrompeer.py`.\r\n\r\n#27749 issue is the number of blocks contained by the first block file, which is not fixed\r\nand can vary depending on the inner block sizes (what is fixed is the total size of the file\r\nbut not the number of blocks that the file contains).\r\n\r\nBasically, `pruneblockchain(height)` tries to prune blocks up to the provided height, which\r\nmeans that it will remove all blocks files that have the \"highest block number\" below that\r\nheight (because only entire files gets pruned).\r\n\r\nThus why the assertion error `not(249 == 248)`.\r\n\r\nIn the test case, the only block file that contains the highest block number below the\r\nprovided height is the first one, which usually contains 248 blocks but.. it could also\r\nhave one more block as well.\r\n\r\nThanks @theStack for investigating this with me :).",
