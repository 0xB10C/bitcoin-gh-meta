   "body" : "This is a cleaner and simpler alternative to #25098. Inspired by [this conversation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27737#issuecomment-1562543301). The diff is large but the change itself is quite small.\r\n\r\nFixes builds with llvm >= 11 in guix by working around the problem. As a bonus, this is much cleaner and more maintainable than what we had before.\r\n\r\nSee the updated comment for more info. At a high level: rather than playing tricks and trying to work around clang's default includes, disable them and re-add what we want.",
