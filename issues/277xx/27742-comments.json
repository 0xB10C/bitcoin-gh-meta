I'd like to get rough consensus on approach before we start looking at code details and merging PRs, because I believe it will help us \"get useful stuff in\" faster and avoid premature optimizations.\r\n\r\nHere are some approach questions I think we should answer before diving in:\r\n1. Does the proposed protocol look sound?\r\n2. Are these 3 milestones appropriate?\r\n3. Is there important functionality that is in the \"todo improvements\" section but should be included in one of the 3 milestones? Alternatively, is there not-that-important stuff in the milestones that we should defer until later?\r\n4. Does it make sense to have this `PeerManager` <-> `TxPackageTracker` <-> `TxOrphanage` relationship?",
