   "body" : "The `process_message_${msg_type}` fuzz targets have many issues:\r\n\r\n* In a context where each fuzz target must be a separate binary, this bloats the storage requirements by the number of message types.\r\n* The qa-assets repo for fuzz inputs also bloats, because each input in the type specific folder (`./process_message_${msg_type}`) is accompanied by a similar input in the general folder (`./process_message`) or a in another specific folder. The size seems to be ~3GB for the sum of all folders vs 0.3GB for the general folder.\r\n* Handling of different folders for each message type and one general folder for all message types (and unknown message types) is undocumented and unclear. Cross-pollination is encouraged, I guess, but who does it?\r\n* It is unclear if the fuzz target has any value at all, given that any bug that is found here should also be found by the `process_messages` fuzz target, and historically always has been? So maybe it can even be removed completely in the future?\r\n\r\nFix all issues by turning the compile-time setting into a run-time setting, thus removing the extra executables and fuzz folders. The same approach is also taken by the `rpc` fuzz target.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to limit their fuzzing to a specific message type, they can still do it. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nLIMIT_TO_MESSAGE_TYPE=inv FUZZ=process_message ./src/test/fuzz/fuzz",
