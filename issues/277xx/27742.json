   "body" : "**WORK IN PROGRESS.** Please do not run it for any use other than testing.\r\n  \r\nThis PR is not meant for merge. This branch exists to help reviewers see what package relay would look like all together. I will open separate PRs for these components and expect to add more tests, docs, and polish along the way. This PR contains all of the functionality built in a linear manner. However, since there are pieces in various areas of the codebase and they can make progress in parallel, commits don't necessarily need to be merged in this order.\r\n\r\n**See #27463 for what PR(s) are open for review right now.**\r\n\r\n## Note to Reviewers\r\n\r\nThe major purpose of this PR is to solicit \"approach\" review.\r\n\r\nThis is a large project, and the first few p2p commits essentially define the interface. I'd like to get rough consensus on approach before we start looking at code details and merging PRs, because I believe it will help us \"get useful stuff in\" faster and avoid premature optimizations.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions I hope are answered before we try to merge anything (originally https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27742#issuecomment-1572205313):\r\n\r\n1. Does the proposed protocol look sound?\r\n2. Are these 3 milestones appropriate?\r\n3. Is there important functionality that is in the \"todo improvements\" section but should be included in one of the 3 milestones? Alternatively, is there not-that-important stuff in the milestones that we should defer until later?\r\n4. Does it make sense to have this PeerManager <-> TxPackageTracker <-> TxOrphanage relationship?\r\n\r\n\r\nComments about naming, typos, code details, etc. are also appreciated but please note I may wait until their respective PRs are open to incorporate your comments. Thank you for your patience.\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\n### 3 Major Milestones\r\n\r\nThis project is split into 3 milestones, each of which gives us something useful.\r\n\r\n1. Modularize and improve orphan-handling (also some refactoring).\r\n\t- Introduce a `TxPackageTracker` class, responsible for orphan handling. It starts out as a wrapper for the `TxOrphanage`.\r\n\t- Use all announcers as potential candidates for resolving an orphan. Add a `TxRequestTracker` Orphan Request Tracker which helps track orphans we need to resolve. Preferentially request orphan resolution from outbounds, preferred relay, etc., over inbounds.\r\n\r\n2. When package relay peers are available, use `ancpkginfo` instead of missing parents when handling orphans.\r\n\t- Add `sendpackages` negotiation logic.\r\n\t- Add a separate rejections filter for transactions that are eligible for reconsideration when validated together as a package, so that children of low-feerate transactions are still considered.\r\n\t- Send `getdata(MSG_ANCPKGINFO)` to package relay peers for orphan resolution. Use `ancpkginfo` to request missing ancestors through normal individual transaction relay.\r\n\r\n3. Download and validate ancestor packages using `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`.\r\n\t- Add support for `getpkgtxns` and `pkgtxns`. Send a `pkgtxns` using the list of missing transactions from `ancpkginfo`.\r\n\t- Ensure we can process \"normal\" orphans even if a peer is trying to overwhelm/churn our orphanage. Do this by \"opportunistically\" protecting orphans from random eviction if they were sent by package relay peers, and redownloading orphans if we cannot afford to protect them. Each peer is allocated a certain amount of orphans they can protect at a time (\"token bucket\" style but the number of tokens is static for now). Outbound peers get more than inbounds.\r\n\t- If a transaction's parent(s) are below the fee filter, don't announce it (save the bandwidth of legacy nodes).\r\n\r\n###  Todo improvements \r\nThese could be added to the milestones or deferred until basic functionality is deployed.\r\n- Store orphans serialized instead of as CTransactionRefs to significantly reduce their memory usage.\r\n- Perhaps try to keep orphans in disk and/or process them asynchronously, given the incredibly DoSable nature of orphan handling.\r\n- Dynamically allocate tokens for orphan protection. For example, if a long-standing inbound peer continuously provides good packages for orphans, they should have more tokens. If a peer is obviously serving us garbage, reduce their tokens.\r\n- Detect when we have received all the transactions for a package, regardless of how (individual or block or other), and return `PackageToValidate`  in `GetTxToReconsider`.\r\n- New format for mempool.dat, packages instead of transactions.",
