Bitcoin Core's wallet has a \"unique\" fingerprint on transactions that is shared by way less than 50% of transactions in the network, so creating additional transactions where it is likely (latest when the outputs are spent) that it was a self-transfer seems only to be bloating the utxo set and chain space? I haven't thought about this, but it would be good to have a more in-depth analysis of this, considering using a different \"fingerprint vector\".",
