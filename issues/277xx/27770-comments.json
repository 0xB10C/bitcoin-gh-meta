(aside from dev curiosity, where I agree that wouldn't be bad to know why).\r\n\r\nThe test goal is to exercise `getblockfrompeer` and not pruning nor where blocks are stored. Having all those hardcoded heights, expecting to have a precise number of blocks in each block file, looks quite fragile.\r\n\r\nI mean, all the hardcoded `pruneheight` numbers and `pruneblockchain(num)` calls looks random at first. It takes a bit to realize that the numbers were picked to prune one block file at time. The `pruneblockchain()` numbers are also extended a bit just in case block files are bigger. Check how they are called: `pruneblockchain(300)`,  `pruneblockchain(700)` when each block file can have ~250 blocks at most; this is my local `getblockfileinfo()` output on each of the three block files presented in the test prior the first `pruneblockchain` call:\r\n\r\n{'blocks_num': 249, 'lowest_block': 0, 'highest_block': 248, 'data_size': 65319, 'undo_size': 10168}\r\n{'blocks_num': 251, 'lowest_block': 249, 'highest_block': 499, 'data_size': 65511, 'undo_size': 10291}\r\n{'blocks_num': 106, 'lowest_block': 500, 'highest_block': 605, 'data_size': 27666, 'undo_size': 4346}\r\n\r\n At least with the `getblockfileinfo()` call we are explicitly pruning the first file, then the second one, etc. Without having to remember how many blocks are stored in each file, nor requiring to extend the prune height just in case.\r\n\r\nI also think that `getblockfileinfo` could be useful in other test contexts as well. Plus, I'm not sure how people call `pruneblockchain` right now, sounds like they blindly call it with a height and only realize up to which block the node pruned the chain when the command returns.\r\n\r\n(if we choose to go into this direction, can remove the remaining hardcoded prune heights in the test).",
