      "body" : "I have a use case for this: \r\n\r\nI'm developing a service that receives bitcoin, with a Bitcoin Core wallet as the underlying wallet. When a transaction comes in I check whether or not it is BIP125 replaceable. If it is _not_, I run it through certain actions when first seeing it in the mempool. Upon receiving a confirmed transaction I need to run the transaction through those actions, if that has not already happened when seeing it in the mempool (i.e. for confirmed transactions that _was_ replaceable). \r\n\r\nIt isn't _too_ hard to check the sequence numbers myself. However, it is _way_ harder than looking at a bool field of a RPC response. Especially for developers who might not be familiar with the technicalities of bitcoin transactions or RBF. ",
