   "body" : "This PR proposes a clean up of the relationship between block storage and the chainstate objects, by moving the decision of whether to store a block on disk to something that is not chainstate-specific.  Philosophically, the decision of whether to store a block on disk is related to validation rules that do not require any UTXO state; for anti-DoS reasons we were using some chainstate-specific heuristics, and those have been reworked here to achieve the proposed separation.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug in how a chainstate's `setBlockIndexCandidates` was being initialized; it should always have all the HAVE_DATA block index entries that have more work than the chain tip.  During startup, we were not fully populating `setBlockIndexCandidates` in some scenarios involving multiple chainstates.\r\n\r\nFurther, this PR establishes a concept that whenever we have 2 chainstates, that we always know what the snapshotted chain's base block is: the block hash must be an element of our block index. Given that, we can establish a new invariant that the background validation chainstate only needs to consider blocks leading to that snapshotted block entry as potential candidates for its tip. As a followup I would imagine that when writing net_processing logic to download blocks for the background chainstate, that we would use this concept to only download blocks towards the snapshotted entry as well.\r\n\r\nThis code needs a lot of cleanup and test fixes and so I've marked it as a draft -- help from reviewers would be welcome!",
