See for instance https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=140078%7CCVE-2013-2292]].  It is absurd that this issue would be ignored in a PR seeking to change mainnet behavior.\r\n\r\nEven putting aside the network-wide risks, I think it would be inappropriate for this project to bless a configuration that could lead to our users allowing themselves to be DoS'ed, which seems like the obvious outcome (I have no idea how we would provide documentation to our users to do these risk assessments themselves).\r\n\r\nIn the most recent PR that tried to do something similar to this (which you also commented on),  I [asked for the particular rules that seem to be problematic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27578#issuecomment-1535568784) (for whatever use case is motivating these PRs) to be spelled out, so that we can discuss -- and perhaps there are indeed modifications to our rules that would be fine and beneficial to the network if we adopted.  If you'd care to do that here, perhaps progress could be made. Treating our standardness rules as a black box to be worked around, without any consideration for _why_ any of these rules exist, is not helpful and not going to lead anywhere.  Concept NACK.\r\n",
