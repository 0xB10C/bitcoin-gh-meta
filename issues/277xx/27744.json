The validation code doesn't know which peer the header came from, so we'd have to move the log entry to net_processing.\r\n\r\nOne way is to add a helper function `LogBlockHeader` and call it right after both `ProcessNewBlockHeaders(header, peer, compact_blk)` calls in net_processing, only if they return true. Since we process headers in batches, it's perhaps easiest to only log the last header.\r\n\r\nDoing so would also make the log less noisy when the header is received via a compact block, because this is the same site that produces the `Saw new cmpctblock header hash` message.",
