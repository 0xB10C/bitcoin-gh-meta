If not, add tests that trigger them.\r\n\r\nAfter that the code should be intentionally broken (e.g. by randomly removing some statements and/or turning some if() to if(!())) and make sure the tests fail.  I volunteer to do this kind of testing (plus some basic smoke tests) once regular unit tests for this are written.\r\n",
