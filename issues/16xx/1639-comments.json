It's a non-starter.\n\n(An example case study: A user installed bitcoin, couple hour sync time. Weeks later he restarted the client, and freaked out that it was back at zero thinking it meant another couple hours. To try to resolve this he downloaded a chain file from a website. But it still showed zero, so he downloaded another chain file and managed to mix up the blk/index files in the process... corrupting his database and then his client wouldn't start. While trying to fix it he followed some instructions and deleted his wallet.  This is an extreme case, but we were getting complaints related to this behavior with fair frequency. It's objectively problematic. The relative indicator may be not very useful, but it's the lesser evil.)\n\nThe recommendation in the last discussion was to find an indicator which both prevents users from freaking out and is also useful and informative for short resyncs. I thought we achieved that already, but if not then we should keep grinding on it. I don't think an option makes sense.",
