   "body" : "For out-of-source builds, the `test/functional/test_runner.py` is supposed to be run from the build directory which allows it to pick the `test/config.ini` file generated by the build system. Currently, it works accidently for the following reasons:\r\n- on POSIX systems, when running a created by Autoconf symlink to the `test/functional/test_runner.py` in the source directory, it actually has the source directory location in the `sys.path`.\r\n- on Windows (the `build_msvc` directory) VS project puts and copies every build artifact into the source tree (which is wrong and ugly).\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `test/functional/test_runner.py` works from a build directory in any form (a symbolic link, a hard link, a copy) on _all_ supported platforms, which is highly desirable in the upcoming [CMake-based build system](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797).\r\n\r\nFor the current master branch, this PR has no behaviour change.\r\n\r\nRequired for https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/15.",
