When I set `-prune=550` the blocks dir ends up somewhere between 3 and 5 GB. Judging by the blkâ¦.dat timestamps it seems that both the snapshot and background IBD hold on to more blocks than they should. Tested on Ubuntu 23.04 and with coinstats- and blockfilterindex enabled. The first time I tested I allowed the node to sync for a few hours before loading the snapshot, the second time I loaded the snapshot almost immediately.",
