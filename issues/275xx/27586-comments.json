One 24.0.1 node with listen=0 did not seem affected.\r\n\r\nI noticed that after a node restart, the CPU usage went back to normal (and is still normal after a day) even though the mempool was loaded from disk - though it might be because it's no longer entirely full due to mempoolminfee.\r\n\r\nPS: These nodes do **not** run in debug mode.",
