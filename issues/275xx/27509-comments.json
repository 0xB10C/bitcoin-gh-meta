I was thinking its probably ok to broadcast to a few peers, not just one. And if they blackhole it, then the code will retry. We can retry more aggressively if it keeps being blackholed. I think it is ok to assume that there are some honest nodes in our addrman.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps it is worth combining this with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213 and instead of one-shot connections we broadcast only to existing selected connections on these privacy networks.\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects of this:\r\n1. Linking a bitcoin transaction to IP address/geolocation. Broadcasting to long-lived Tor/I2P connections solves this (modulo other issues like linking Tor nodes with IP addresses).\r\n2. Linking one bitcoin transaction with another bitcoin transaction that otherwise are unrelated. To solve/mitigate this we need to send each transaction over its individual connection and that connection to not be linkable to other connections.\r\n\r\n> Not sure if this should be the default or an optional mode\r\n\r\nRight, also assuming there will be bugs/unexpected things - maybe have an option to enable/disable this. Hardest would be to introduce it without an option to disable it. Softest approach would be: 1. introduce under an option with default off, 2. in next version flip the default to on (if it seems to be working well)\r\n\r\n> It might also be helpful to combine this with some heuristics that the tx percolated through the network:\r\nFor example, require that 2 of your regular full outbound connections (that you didn't send it to ) have inv'ed the tx back to you - otherwise try again after some time.\r\n\r\nI actually changed the behavior to do something like that in 512077bb8805eacb671eabcf9d62463a2a6e6a39 `net_processing: relay local transactions via the SENSITIVE_RELAY mechanism` in this PR: see where `RemoveUnbroadcastTx()` was called before / is called now. Maybe that deserves a separate commit. Before we would be ok as long as we pushed the tx to the peer. Now we wait until we receive an `INV` about that tx from somebody. There is some room for improvement - added in the TODO in the OP.",
