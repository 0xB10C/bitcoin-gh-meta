      "body" : "Concept NACK.\r\n\r\nIf there's a standardness rule that is interfering with someone's use case, we should discuss it and figure out whether the rule can be relaxed to accommodate the use case, or whether the use case can be adapted to comply with the standardness rules.  Generally speaking, our policy rules are designed to prevent various kinds of denial-of-service attacks, or to help make sure the network runs smoothly -- so if users are trying to bypass them, there's a good chance that there's insufficient understanding of why rules are in place (or possibly the rules are more restrictive than they need to be).\r\n\r\nMoreover, while running with different policies is not something that we can prevent on the network, we should be mindful that if the prevailing network policy is different than what a use case needs, that the use case will likely not be met anyway without some sort of preferential peering with other nodes running the same policy.  So this approach strikes me as insufficient to even achieve the goal it is aiming for.",
