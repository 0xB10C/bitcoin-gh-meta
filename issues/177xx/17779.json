This is confusing for users, and might deter them from running a full node.\r\n\r\nThere have already been several attempts [#6613 #6650 #16721] to obfuscate database so to not get flagged, but this has so far not solved the problem entirely.\r\n\r\nAs I read in the above mentioned issues, this might [not really be of concern to this repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12320#issuecomment-370557246), so my issue might be misplaced, if that is the case please close it.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\nI am unsure about the best approach to solving this issue, thus I open this issue to discuss and coordinate. My idea is to contact the companies and developers of these anti virus programs and reporting the false positive flag, with the request to fix the wrong analysis for these binaries.\r\n\r\nIf this is the proper way of doing so, I have curated online forms and email addresses where such a false positive can be reported. [I will edit this issue when I find further sources.]\r\n\r\n** Online Forms **\r\n[avast](https://www.avast.com/false-positive-file-form.php), [avg](https://www.avg.com/en-us/false-positive-file-form?page=success), [f-secure](https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/labs_global/submit-a-sample), [kapersky](https://virusdesk.kaspersky.com/), [e-gambit](https://tehtris.com/en/fp-egambit/), [K7 computing](https://www.k7computing.com/us/contact-us)\r\n\r\n** Emails ** \r\nremovespam@fortinet.com, support@cyren.com\r\n\r\nThe email should include the title \"False Positive Reporting\", as well as a ziped file of the binaries that are flagged. Some also require full name [even address], which might be an issue for contributors, and I hope that using pseudonyms will suffice.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI bring this up now because with [Wasabi Wallet v1.1.10](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/releases/tag/v1.1.10), the [included bitcoind and hwi binaries](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/tree/master/WalletWasabi/Microservices/Binaries) are part of the reason why [Wasabi is now also flagged](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/pull/2858) as a potentially unwanted program.",
