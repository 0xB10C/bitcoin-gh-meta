This should also be useful to the watch-only side of cold storage.\r\n\r\nThe seed is not deleted. It is still in the wallet file, just not active.

Creating new wallet.dat types won't eliminate all those existing old messy `wallet.dat`s.\r\n\r\n>Please also stop mixing together BIP 39 with BIP 44/49/84, they describe different things. BIP 39 is the mnemonic scheme which is wholly independent of the derivation paths described by BIPs 44/49/84.\r\n\r\nI didn't mix them up. I just said that it's exactly the point of BIP39 to be \"wholly independent of the derivation paths described by BIPs 44/49/84\", which was on the contrary considered a flaw of it.\r\n\r\nJust like what *Mastering Bitcoin* had said:\r\n>As bitcoin wallet technology has matured, certain common industry standards have emerged that make bitcoin wallets broadly interoperable, easy to use, secure, and flexible. These common standards are:\r\n>\r\n>- Mnemonic code words, based on BIP-39\r\n>\r\n>- HD wallets, based on BIP-32\r\n>\r\n>- Multipurpose HD wallet structure, based on BIP-43\r\n>\r\n>- Multicurrency and multiaccount wallets, based on BIP-44\r\n>\r\n>These standards may change or may become obsolete by future developments, but for now they form a set of interlocking technologies that have become the de facto wallet standard for bitcoin.\r\n>\r\n>The standards have been adopted by a broad range of software and hardware bitcoin wallets, making all these wallets interoperable. A user can export a mnemonic generated on one of these wallets and import it in another wallet, recovering all transactions, keys, and addresses.\r\n\r\nThe core idea I had suggested was that:\r\n\r\n1. Bitcoin Core should support the standardized scheme of BIP39/44/49/84.\r\n\r\n2. It should be the priority to deliver an usable solution to the users, rather than to wait for a nealy-ideal proposal to appear.\r\n\r\n3. A standardized proposal is always the best proposal, far better than a mess of \"improved proposals\" which are incompatible with each other.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's already scary enough to push the users to join the army of \"single precious WIF privkey fetishism\".\r\n\r\n>We will not be using the ypub/zpub export format as descriptors are far more descriptive than those are.\r\n\r\nAt least Bitcoin Core should support importing them. I think the interoperability provided by supporting ypub/zpub really worth it, although it might seem to be \"a non-normative way\" or \"a layer violation\".",
