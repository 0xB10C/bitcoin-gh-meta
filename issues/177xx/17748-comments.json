While descriptors (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md) are already supported in import, they're still converted at import time to the old wallet.dat structures. With descriptor wallets, the actual description of the addresses/keys in the wallet will be one or a few descriptors, along with some metadata. That's not quite what you're talking about with BIP39-like constructions, but I believe it's a large improvement in minimizing and structuring the amount of state that needs to be safeguarded.\r\n",

      "body" : "As far as mnemonics goes, I think it's very reasonable to have support for converting various kinds to descriptors and importing those once we have descriptor wallets, as that should be very easy and safe at that point.\r\n\r\nIf you're talking about *just* mnemonics there is the complication that there isn't really a watch-only version of them. Wallets should know what to watch (what type of scripts, keys for other multisig participants, possibly policies that degrade over time using locktime, ...) independently of what their own private key is. I expect that that will end up just being descriptors. So I don't know what mnemonics support would look like, and how useful it is, if you still need a separate (but non-secret) description of your wallet.",
