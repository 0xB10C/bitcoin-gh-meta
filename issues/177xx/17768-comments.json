One being that you can't actually compile qt 5.12.6 for macOS targeting C++11 (even though it's a configure option), as they have started using C++14 features in the macOS portions of the code, i.e `qcocoabackingstore`. Qt have also removed `xkbcommon` from their third-party tree, which means we'll likely have to integrate it into depends. Windows wants to link against the Remote Desktop API to fix a clipboard copying bug.. . Probably something we can either patch out/turn off.\r\n\r\nThere is a related [QTBUG-77310](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-77310):\r\n> Building Qt requires C+11, at a minimum, but in practice we use later features, usually under a feature define, or with a fallback of some kind. On platforms that support > C11, we've (apparently) not considered the fallback necessary, under the assumption C+14 is always available. ",
