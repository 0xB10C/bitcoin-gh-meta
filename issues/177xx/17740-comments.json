It might not be something that's ever required to explicitly link against, but it feels risky somehow.~~\r\n\r\nOh, I missed the \"none of these libs actually seem to be passed to the linker\"âok in that case, I don't see why it's checking for the library\r\n\r\nSo this is safe. These checks don't *cause* linkage. They just check whether the library exists. I suppose the explicit check for `mingwthrd` was added at some point to be sure a thread-supporting mingw is used.
