I think hardcoding (or at least, having your own constants for these in your applications) these things makes a lot of sense because they're not going to change without a reason you probably need to be aware of!\r\n\r\n(Say, in the unlikely case that there would be a new kind of base58 address format, you wouldn't want your application to silently start accepting them without at least having looked over it. Doing so might lead to funds loss.)",
