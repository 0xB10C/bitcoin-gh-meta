That's great!\r\n\r\nOne of the problems with line coverage non-determinism is that it makes it impossible to reason about line coverage with precision. More specifically having line coverage non-determinism makes it impossible to say if a PR will reduce or increase line coverage since the delta in line coverage due to the suggested change will be added to a random variable (the existing line coverage which varies between runs due to non-determinism in a few tests).\r\n\r\nIn cases where the ideal solution of making the tests deterministic by adjusting the existing test logic is not possible or hard to achieve I think your suggestion makes sense as a second-best alternative. That will give us a stable line coverage number and thus the ability to reason about the line coverage impact of suggested changes :)\r\n\r\nSince this only is relevant for a small set of tests I don't see any real downside of what you suggest: if/when \"proper test determinism\" is introduced for the test in question the temporary fix suggested can simply be removed, and a comment on why the extra testing code is needed will eliminate any confusion.\r\n\r\nAgain: thanks a lot for working on making our unit tests deterministic in terms of line coverage! :)\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to ping me if you need a test determinism PR reviewed or if I can help in any other way :)",
