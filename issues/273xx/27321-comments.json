      "body" : "Hello @MarcoFalke!\r\nI'm new to Bitcoin Core development as well as Bash scripting. But, based on the requirements and the script, I believe I can tackle this.\r\n\r\nI only have a few questions:\r\n1) I discovered other files in the test directory, such as ci/test/04_install, also contain the CI_EXEC_ROOT and CI_EXEC alias. So, are they also to be modified?\r\n\r\n2) After reading your comment in the script, I believe I can just remove the CI_EXEC_ROOT and CI_EXEC parts of differentÂ commands in the scriptÂ and itÂ will run just fine, as it is already run in bash. Except, for the apt install parts where I have to remove the alias and replace it with bash -c, as you said. \r\nSo, am I thinking in the right direction?\r\n\r\nI can start working on this from Monday. So, if this is urgent or anyone else thinks they are more qualified than me to work on this, I would love to do a code review on their PR as well. I just want to get started and be involved.",
