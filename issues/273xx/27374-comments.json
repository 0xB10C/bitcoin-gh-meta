Add an additional check inside `LimitOutboundByNetgroup()` to skip netgroup diversity checks for outbound connections belonging to pure Tor-only/I2P-only/CJDNS-only networks. Then use this as a gatekeeper before choosing diverse netgroup addresses to make outbound connections to.\r\n2.

As far as I can see, this logic should equally be applied to addrs from alt networks, so it might be better to leave `setConnected` unchanged as sdaftuar suggested?\r\n\r\n@lightlike Good observation, I missed this.  I think that bit of code that we're using in our `OpenNetworkConnection()` call is really trying to determine how many open connections we have, not how many distinct netgroups we're connected to?  So from that perspective, I believe that line of code is written incorrectly; if we are running only on Tor and we happen to have 8 peers from the same netgroup, then presumably we are sufficiently connected that any failures to connect should be recorded in addrman.\r\n\r\nSo I think the right change here is to modify that line to just sum the number of outbound connections (full-relay, block-relay, addr-fetch, manual, and feelers) and use that in place of `setConnected.size()`.\r\n\r\n> Does this PR trick the code to behave as if we are not connected to Tor (by not inserting into setConnected) even if we are connected? It looks to me that trying to solve the problem of \"cannot open many connections to Tor\" this would create another problem: \"too many connections to Tor\" - it would allow all 8 outbound to be to Tor and will not try to diversify to IPv4 (or other networks).\r\n\r\n@vasild While it's possible that we'd make all 8 of our outbound connections to Tor peers, I think this is an unlikely problem, because we limit the number of Tor connections to be a fraction of our addrman (I can't recall what that fraction is though, can someone remind us?).  I believe that an adversary looking to exploit this can really only do so for (eg) new nodes that have a relatively small addrman, by flooding such a node with onion addresses; but that attack is already available today (since we have 16 different onion netgroups, an adversary creating a zillion onion addresses to eclipse a victim will just have the ones that are in different netgroups be the ones that eclipse a peer, instead of ones in the same netgroup).\r\n\r\nSo I don't think that this PR makes that problem any worse, and we can wait until we have something like #27213 to solve this problem more generally.\r\n\r\n> I feel that we should lookup -onlynet or allow connections to Tor up to a limit to avoid \"too many connections to Tor\". \r\n\r\nI think this is unnecessary and would be counter to what we're trying to fix here.  If a node is running on both ipv4 and tor, I think we should still not require netgroup diversity across the tor peers, because such diversity is meaningless.  And as I explained above I don't think the implicit limiting of tor peers that might arise from this would be needed or desirable.\r\n\r\n> still curious to know opinions about increasing 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()`\r\n\r\nThis would double the number of addrman slots that can be used by Tor peers, right?  My off the cuff guess is that this would be undesirable, but I haven't gone back to figure out what fraction of the addrman this would be yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
