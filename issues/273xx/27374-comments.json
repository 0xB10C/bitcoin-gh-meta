It looks to me that trying to solve the problem of \"cannot open many connections to Tor\" this would create another problem: \"too many connections to Tor\" - it would allow all 8 outbound to be to Tor and will not try to diversify to IPv4 (or other networks).\r\n\r\nI feel that we should lookup `-onlynet` or allow connections to Tor up to a limit to avoid \"too many connections to Tor\". Or maybe, increase the 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()` :disappointed:. In the long term, I guess, it would be best to expand the concept of \"network group\" to \"network group with route based diversification\" (IP) + \"network group without route based diversification\" (tor/i2p/cjdns).\r\n\r\nPS This is very much related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213\r\nPS run `clang-format`",

Add an additional check inside `LimitOutboundByNetgroup()` to skip netgroup diversity checks for outbound connections belonging to pure Tor-only/I2P-only/CJDNS-only networks. Then use this as a gatekeeper before choosing diverse netgroup addresses to make outbound connections to.\r\n2. [increase the 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27374#issuecomment-1491308956)\r\n   - this seems to be the simplest option! but i'm unsure about how it will affect other areas in the codebase where `GetGroup()` is used.\r\n \r\ncurious to know what everyone thinks about option 2? (otherwise we can go with option 1 for now)",
