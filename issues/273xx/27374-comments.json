      "body" : "Does this PR trick the code to behave as if we are not connected to Tor (by not inserting into `setConnected`) even if we are connected? It looks to me that trying to solve the problem of \"cannot open many connections to Tor\" this would create another problem: \"too many connections to Tor\" - it would allow all 8 outbound to be to Tor and will not try to diversify to IPv4 (or other networks).\r\n\r\nI feel that we should lookup `-onlynet` or allow connections to Tor up to a limit to avoid \"too many connections to Tor\". Or maybe, increase the 4 bits to 5 bits in `GetGroup()` :disappointed:. In the long term, I guess, it would be best to expand the concept of \"network group\" to \"network group with route based diversification\" (IP) + \"network group without route based diversification\" (tor/i2p/cjdns).\r\n\r\nPS This is very much related to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27213\r\nPS run `clang-format`",
