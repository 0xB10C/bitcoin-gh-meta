The intent appears to be:\r\n* If we want more data than is available (overrun), clear the caller-provided buffer.\r\n\r\nNaively, a _working_ memset() in this location would seem to be wise security practice, and thus, a minor security bug.  If you throw an error but catch it later (ie. process does not exit), then potentially sensitive wallet data is left in unguarded memory, if you are de-serializing sensitive data at the time of thrown exception.\r\n\r\nWe are deserializing non-sensitive data 99% of the time, so this is a rare error case, but it does seem to fall within the rubric of secure allocation/clearing.\r\n",
