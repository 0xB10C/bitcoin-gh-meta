Therefore, at the same IP address as bitcoind, other services are made available to the public (scriptPubkey queries, other added-value queries).  This results in a decentralized network of \"anyone running a full node _and_ an insight server\", as a subset of the whole P2P net.  </vendor hat>\r\n\r\nObviously, we want to build this in a generic, vendor-neutral way.\r\n\r\nServices may only advertise added services **if and only if** the external services are at the same IP address that is being advertised.\r\n",
