It ignores the way struct and classes are used differently, and the reason `m_` and `g_` prefixes were introduced, which was to make it possible to distinguish local variable references from member variable and global variable references. For example with:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvar = 3;\r\nm_var = 3;\r\ng_var = 3;\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe prefixes help you see without looking things up that `var` is a local variable, `m_var` is a member variable and `g_var` is a global variable, and helps you read and navigate code more quickly.\r\n\r\nThe `m_` prefix doesn't serve a purpose for structs because because implicit `this` isn't used for struct accesses:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ns.var = 3;\r\np->var = 4;\r\n```\r\n\r\nClearly with `s.var` or `p->var`, `var` is a struct member. Replacing it with `m_var` just adds noise.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to add code conventions when it solves problems, but it's not clear what problem would be solved by adding this convention.\r\n\r\n(Somewhat related: I wouldn't mind having conventions that help make the differences between classes and structs clear. I'd be happy with a convention that encouraged class member variables not to be public, so you'd be unlikely to see `c->m_var = 3`, and a convention that would encourage structs not to have methods and only have public members, so the structs would be used properly. I think we basically do follow these conventions so there may be little need to write them down.)",

See for example:\r\n\r\n- [CNodeState and its sub-structs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a2a250c7d07bcb80cefca9dd4a7ce57f41291334/src/net_processing.cpp#L276)\r\n- [CConnman::Options](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a2a250c7d07bcb80cefca9dd4a7ce57f41291334/src/net.h#L141)\r\n- [CNodeStats](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a2a250c7d07bcb80cefca9dd4a7ce57f41291334/src/net.h#L614) (which is a class but should really be a struct since it only has public data members).\r\n\r\nThe newer data members in those structs are prefixed `m_`.\r\n\r\nMy vote is for the first option, since having a consistent rule across classes and structs is easier to state/follow, and people naturally seem to be doing it already.",
