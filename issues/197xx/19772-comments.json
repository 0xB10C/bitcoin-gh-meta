This doesn't play nicely with the llibtool hacks we use to build fully static DLLs for Windows. I do have one idea about how we might fix this, but would probably like to get #19558 in first.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is a duplicate of the second issue in #19286. Maybe drop it from that issue so we can keep any discussion here.",
