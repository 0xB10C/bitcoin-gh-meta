But I wouldn't exactly say this is obvious. *Normally* to create compact structures the preferred ordering is to have larger alignment fields first, then smaller one. The reason it's different here is because of the inheritance.\r\n\r\n>  No conflicts, either one can go first without disturbing the other one. Size reduced from 56 to 48 bytes.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
