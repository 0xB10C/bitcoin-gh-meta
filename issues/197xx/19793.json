In that situation, the wallet is still recoverable by deleting all txs and rescanning.\r\n\r\nThis commit was originally part of #19457 with tweaks from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19457#discussion_r469510175.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change is to avoid crashes with #19078. Probably a better fix for #19078 is possible with more debugging, but returning a clear error instead of asserting false should an improvement regardless.",
