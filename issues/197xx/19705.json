   "body" : "`CAddress` inherits `CService` which is 28 bytes (on 64 bit machines).\r\n`CAddress` then adds two member variables - one that requires 4 byte\r\nalignment (`nTime`) and one that requires 8 byte alignment\r\n(`nServices`).\r\n\r\nDeclare the smaller one first so that it fits in bytes 29..32.\r\n\r\nOn 32 bit machines this change has no effect and `CAddress` remains 40\r\nbytes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
