It is now being called from within `LoadWallet`, `RemoveWallet`, and `CreateWallet`, all of which now take an `Optional<bool>` to indicate whether the setting should be updated.\r\n\r\nThe GUI interface has also been updated to use the new function definitions. In the GUI, for loading and creating a wallet, `load_on_start` is always true, for unloading a wallet, it is always false.",
