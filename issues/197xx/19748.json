   "body" : "`banlist.dat` was introduced in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6310, storing nodes that were automatically banned (due to exceeding the misbehavior threshold) and manually banned (through the `setban` RPC).\r\n\r\nAutomatic bans were removed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19219 and replaced with a discouragement filter. That filter is not saved to disk/persisted over shutdown/startup. The `banlist.dat` therefore now only contains addresses that have been banned through the `setban` rpc.\r\n\r\nSince https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15935, we have a specific file for configuration that is updated through the RPC and persisted over shutdown/startup, namely `settings.json`. We should therefore move the manual ban configuration from `banlist.dat` to `settings.json`. Doing so has a couple of benefits:\r\n\r\n- `settings.json` is human readable and easily analyzable by any json parser.\r\n- we wouldn't need to maintain custom [de]serialization code for the `banlist.dat` file.\r\n\r\n`banlist.dat` is expected to be fairly small and infrequently updated, so disk space/performance are not huge concerns.",
