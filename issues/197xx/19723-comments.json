      "body" : "I've withdrawn my BIP proposal relating to this change, but I think it's worth considering making this change anyway.\r\n\r\nMy thought is that if other software on the network deploys changes similar to BIP 339 in the future (where a new message is included between version and verack) that we don't want to support in our project, then it's easier to ignore all such messages than it is to add support for specifically ignoring each such message as it is proposed.\r\n\r\nIf we were to overlook someone's optional p2p protocol change and then bumped our protocol version at a later date in support of some other change, we would risk needlessly disconnecting other peers.\r\n\r\nNote that if a peer never sends a verack, we still disconnect them after 60 seconds, so I think the only downside from this change is that we'd tolerate 60 seconds worth of garbage from a peer before they disconnect.  Given that a peer can waste our bandwidth anyway by sending the verack and spamming us with (eg) bogus transactions, this bandwidth issue seems like an orthogonal concern.  If we want to address the bandwidth issue somehow, I think we could do so for both pre-verack and post-verack messages at a later time.",
