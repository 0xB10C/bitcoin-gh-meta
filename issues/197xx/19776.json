   "body" : "Fixes #19676, \"_For every peer expose through getpeerinfo RPC whether or not we selected them as HB peers, and whether or not they selected us as HB peers._\" See [BIP152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki), in particular the [protocol flow diagram](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/raw/master/bip-0152/protocol-flow.png).  The newly introduced states are changed on the following places in the code:\r\n* on reception of a `SENDCMPCTBLOCK` message with valid version, the field `m_highbandwidth_from` is changed depending on the first integer parameter in the message (1=high bandwidth, 0=low bandwidth), i.e. it just mirrors the field `CNodeState.fPreferHeaderAndIDs`.\r\n* after adding a `SENDCMPCTBLOCK` message to the send queue, the field `m_highbandwidth_to` is changed depending on how the first integer parameter is set (same as above)\r\n\r\nNote that after receiving `VERACK`, the node also sends `SENDCMPCTBLOCK`, but that is only to announce the preferred version and never selects high-bandwidth mode, hence there is no need to change the state variables there, which are initialized to `false` anyways.\r\n",
