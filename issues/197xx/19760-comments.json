I was skeptical about calling it \"p2p\" at first as well but, right now, it sounds most sensible to me. Open to discussion.\r\n\r\nCalling it MockNode would be even more confusing I think, because that sounds so similar to TestNode, and we often \"mock\" things (e.g. time) so that we can manipulate them in the functional tests. I'd even be ok with renaming TestNode to MockNode.\r\n\r\nI can't really think of anything that mininodes do other than send/receive p2p messages. I think of mininodes as fake peers (but only when connected, as jnewbery said above) that we have full control over, and can use to elicit some behavior from the TestNode(s). But all they can do is p2p messages, nothing more, so it's incorrect to call them \"__nodes\". Mininodes cannot validate anything and cannot make transactions or blocks (only send them). I'm pretty sure they're only able to connect to 1 TestNode at a time. They also don't even always follow p2p protocol (which can be a conservative definition of a node) e.g. p2p_leak.py.",
