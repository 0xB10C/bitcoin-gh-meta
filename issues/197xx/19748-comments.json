Also if there is a use-case for wanting to allow manual bans and run bitcoin with `-nosettings` or with the settings file in a read-only location, it could be another reason to use a different file.\r\n\r\nBut thinking of settings.json as storage more under user control is just my own inclination. Best to chose an approach based on concrete advantages and disadvantages.",
