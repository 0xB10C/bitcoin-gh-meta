Even though it's only a couple lines, the burden of this variable is massive: I spent 10 minutes figuring what does it do, even after reading the PR description.\r\n\r\nI tried to make sure we don't miss any corner cases, and I think this PR works correctly.\r\n\r\nRegarding your commit message:\r\n>2.) If the response to GETADDR is small  (<=10 addresses), it will be relayed to peers just as any other ADDR message of that size.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's a bug in master. I always thought of `<=10` check as something to limit the forwarding of unsolicited ADDRs. Now it may also forward a solicited ADDR. May it leak privacy somehow? I guess not, because we don't send them out immediately anyway.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAs a side note, is this possible?\r\n1. Victim node V starts and connects to their peers\r\n2. An attacker spams V with a lot of unsolicited ADDR messages (of size <10 but from different Sybils) to make sure all ADDRs V sends to their peers is of size 11 at least.\r\n3. V's self-announcements (and other unsolicited ADDRs from V) are never forwarded by their peers, so only immediate peers ever learn about V.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't address this issue as a whole, but it removes one out of two mechanisms making this possible I believe :)\r\nI think we should look further and see if we can fix it in full, perhaps in another PR.",
