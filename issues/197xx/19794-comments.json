If the response to GETADDR is small  (<=10 addresses), it will be relayed to peers just as any other ADDR message of that size.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's a bug in master. I always thought of `<=10` check as something to limit the forwarding of unsolicited ADDRs. Now it may also forward a solicited ADDR. May it leak privacy somehow?

An attacker spams V with a lot of unsolicited ADDR messages (of size <10 but from different Sybils) to make sure all ADDRs V sends to their peers is of size 11 at least.\r\n3. V's self-announcements (and other unsolicited ADDRs from V) are never forwarded by their peers, so only immediate peers ever learn about V.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't address this issue as a whole, but it removes one out of two mechanisms making this possible I believe :)\r\nI think we should look further and see if we can fix it in full, perhaps in another PR.",

In any case, I don't think that this will occur often, because with `MAX_PCT_ADDR_TO_SEND = 23` it would mean that an honest peer would need to have a really small addrman with less than 50 addresses  to send such a small response - usually, GETADDR responses should be considerably larger.\r\n\r\nRegarding your scenario:\r\nI think this is a very interesting scenario and probably worth addressing (V's address  could still be part of a GETADDR response though, even if it not forwarded).\r\nI don't see though how this PR helps with this even a little. On current master, `fGetAddr` is set in the VERSION processing with an outbound peer, and immediately unset as soon as we get a single ADDR with size < 1000 from the peer (and can never be set again for the duration of the connection) - while your scenario entails repeated messages.\r\n ",

We just connected to the peer and send them a `GETADDR`\r\n2. Before getting `GETADDR`, they schedule their self-announcement for us by adding their addr to vAddrToSend\r\n3. Their ADDR sending is triggered (see `pto->m_next_addr_send < current_time`)\r\n4. *We receive their self-announcement containing only 1 addr and keep fGetAddr=true*\r\n5. They finally receive our `GETADDR` and schedule their response (can be flipped with (4))\r\n\r\nI think this order of events is unlikely (need much luck for (3) to happen before (5)) but possible.\r\n\r\nIn that case,\r\n- before this PR, we would not forward their self-announcement at (2), because `fGetAddr=true`\r\n- after this PR, we would forward their self-announcement at (2)\r\n\r\nI think this is actually an improvement. I don't see any reason to withhold an initial announcement of the peer instead of forwarding it to other nodes.\r\n\r\nEven if this had any privacy benefits as a side-effect (e.g., somehow less revealing of new connections), it had a very low chance of working. Maybe this should be a real feature tho.",
