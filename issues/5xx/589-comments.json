      "body" : "> does it crash with a segfault or does it stop responding to JSON-RPC requests?\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there's no segfault.  The process simply exits. That made me think the OOM killer had killed the daemon, but kernel logs show no OOM killer activity in the last 2 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n> What is it busy doing-- responding to getwork requests?  Handling users' wallets?  Is it under heavy JSON-RPC load?\r\n\r\nOther than activity required for staying connected as a peer, the daemon is completely idle.  I manually execute an API request once every few days, but otherwise it receives no API activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Can you compile -g -ggdb and run under the gdb debugger?\r\n> \r\n> Can you compile -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER and then run? Previous hangs were due to deadlocks between threads...\r\n\r\nSo far I've been unable to compile Bitcoin from source.  I'll try again now that QT is merged.  I'll post back with further details.\r\n\r\n> Oh, and what variation of Linux?\r\n\r\nDebian 6.0.3",
