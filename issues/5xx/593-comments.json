Otherwise, you could shorten the function by leaving out the `DirectConnection`/`BlockedQueuedConnection` and simply use `QueuedConnection` to send signals asynchronously\r\n- Security: any browser<->bitcoin UI binding scares me a bit.

I would instead just say that since the sendcoinsentry scrolls to the bottom when new recipients are added, it can be safely left up to the user to check the send (especially since the list of recipients is repeated in the confirmation dialog anyway).",
