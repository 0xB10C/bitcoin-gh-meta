And adds public key information to the output of the \"validateaddress\" RPC command, so you can get the full public key for addresses in your wallet.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood tests for THIS pull would be:\r\n\r\n+ Setup a testnet-in-a-box testing environment\r\n+ Compile two bitcoind's : one with this pull request and one with the multisig_testing pull request\r\n+ Get three full public keys from a testnet wallet by running the multisig_testing bitcoind against that wallet.  Then shutdown that bitcoind, and run bitcoind with THIS pull request against that wallet.\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n\r\nRunning the multisig_testing bitcoind against another testnet wallet, send multisig transactions to the first wallet.\r\nEXPECT: balance in the first wallet does not change, transactions are ignored.\r\nEXPECT: eventually the transactions are confirmed and included in blocks and shown in the testnet block explorer (testnet allows non-standard transactions)\r\n\r\nSyntax for the sendmultisig RPC command is:\r\n\r\nbitcoind sendmultisig \"\" and_or '[\"...key1...\",\"...key2...\",\"...key3...\"]' 11.11\r\n\r\n... where \"\" is the account you're sending from and 11.11 is the amount.\r\n\r\nI am NOT submitting a pull request for sendmultisig, and you shouldn't spend time testing it right now.\r\nI may submit a separate pull request for the validateaddress extension.\r\n",
