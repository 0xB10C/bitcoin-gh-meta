That's probably more inline with what you're seeing?\r\n\r\nAlso, as I see it, there's really no use in keeping more than one version of each object around, since each cache matches a single build config. It either matches the current revision or it can be discarded. So my target with the 100mb figure was the largest reasonable compressed store of one version of all objects. ",
