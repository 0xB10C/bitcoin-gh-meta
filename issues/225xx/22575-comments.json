Regardless of that, named arguments are (IMHO) a better approach since it makes explicit for the reader what values are used for.\r\n\r\nI think another important thing our RPC server is missing is the ability to require option-style parameters to be passed by name, and to disallow passing them by position. Combined with #19762 this would let us safely provide RPC methods accepting only a small number of positional arguments, but a large number of named options, so there is no need for command line users to use json object syntax, but also no risk of getting options confused by trying to pass them by position. This should probably be simple to implement as RPCHelpMan extension after #19762 and would be equivalent to python's keyword-only argument feature `def fun(arg1, arg2, *, option1, option2)` https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/#rationale",
