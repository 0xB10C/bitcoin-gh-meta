There isnât a specific identity requirement for this signature: a simple ad-hoc signature is sufficient...\r\n>  - ... If you use a custom workflow involving tools that modify a binary after linking (e.g. `strip` or `install_name_tool`) you might need to manually call `codesign` as an additional build phase to properly ad-hoc sign your binary. These new signatures are not bound to the specific machine that was used to build the executable, they can be verified on any other system and will be sufficient to comply with the new default code signing requirement on Macs with Apple silicon...",
