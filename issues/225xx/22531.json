   "body" : "`guix-verify` currently looks for `all.SHA256SUMS` but `guix-attest` produces `codesigned.SHA256SUMS`. This means that `guix-verify` fails to verify the codesigned sha256sums. This PR changes it (and sanity checks in `guix-attest) to look for `codesigned.SHA256SUMS` instead.\r\n\r\n`guix-verify` incorrectly sanity checks that `noncodesigned.SHA256SUMS` doesn't have lines that aren't in `codesigned.SHA256SUMS`. `comm` is the incorrect command to use since it does a direct line by line comparison. This would only work if `codesigned.SHA256SUMS` was just `noncodesigned.SHA256SUMS` with the codesigned stuff appended, but it clearly is not, and the use of `sort` basically guarantees it is not. So the order will be different with added lines inserted randomly and this causes `comm` to fail and this sanity check to erroneously fail. This PR fixes this by changing to using `diff` and searching for `diff`'s indicator of the left side having a difference.\r\n\r\nLastly, as a quality of life improvement, `guix-verify` can take `SIGNER` and use the signer's manifest as the base to compare against. This makes it easier to compare a single person's attestations with everyone else's and can make it more obvious when one builder is clearly mismatching with everyone else.",
