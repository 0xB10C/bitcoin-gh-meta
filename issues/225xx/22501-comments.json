Given they are additive, it seems unsustainable to just keep adding new levels and more info.\r\n\r\nRight, the data provided by getpeerinfo seems to be the upper bound, and apart from the bytes sent/received objects, there are only a handful of remaining fields. My current thought is to no longer add to level 4 by default and orient it to node operators, and to use level 5 for data more suited to dev/testing. Open to feedback, of course.\r\n",
