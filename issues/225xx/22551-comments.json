It can make the fuzzers (somewhat, not sure how to measure) less efficient though, as they chase spurious coverage differences vs. real ones.  I suspect this is why some afl 'new edges' don't actually ever get merged.  They were just lucky hits on mutex/etc. changes.  Not a big deal, but I don't know how much effort it is.",
