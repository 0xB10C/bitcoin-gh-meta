Warnings could indicate problems, but not necessarily.\r\n\r\n> This happens sporadically, and I have not been able to figure out how to reproduce\r\n\r\nWhen you compile, each object file `namespace.o` is built once. If you recompile, it may use the cache that's around from last build, and it won't rebuild the objects that haven't changed. If it uses the cache and doesn't compile the object, you won't see the warning. If you don't want to use the cache, use `make clean` to delete the build files, then run `make` as usual.",
