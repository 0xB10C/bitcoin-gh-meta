This backports cleanly to 0.18 and should resolve the outstanding p2p issue.\r\n\r\nTo recap - there's a bug in managing the data structures tracking transaction downloads in-flight from our peers that was introduced in #14897, specifically concerning the handling of NOTFOUND messages.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that bug, and it adds a general expiry mechanism (originally proposed by @ajtowns in #15776) for removing entries from the in-flight map, to add robustness in the event there are scenarios we're overlooking that might cause the in-flight data structures to fill up over time.",
