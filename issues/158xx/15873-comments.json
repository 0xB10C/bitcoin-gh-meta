Sometimes by some reason users transactions stuck for long time (very small percent). While blockexplorers kick users transactions from their mempool (which looks for users that their transaction not exists anymore), bitcoind which used by service still hold it. Previously for removing such transactions I was need stop bitcoind, remove `mempool.dat` and start bitcoind again. This is not good way for removing just 1 transaction from whole mempool. With this new RPC command removing stuck tx from mempool will be much easier.",

      "body" : "I think this PR is the result of a misunderstanding of how transaction propagation and confirmation works in Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n> While blockexplorers kick users transactions from their mempool (which looks for users that their transaction not exists anymore)\r\n\r\nI expect that the vast majority of block explorers are backed by a Bitcoin Core node. The mempool will not remove a transaction except for:\r\n\r\n- expiry (if the transaction has been in the mempool for two weeks and is not confirmed)\r\n- limiting (the mempool is full and low-feerate transactions are removed from the bottom)\r\n- removeForBlock (removes any transactions that were included in or conflicted in a confirmed transaction in the blockchain)\r\n- replacement (replaced by fee under BIP 125 rules)\r\n\r\nRemoving a transaction from your local mempool will not result in that transaction being removed from anyone else's mempool. Even if you then create a new transaction that spends the same inputs, it will not cause the original transaction to be displaced in other node's mempools (except if it meets the BIP 125 conditions).\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the original motivation for this PR. If so, can you give more details?",
