      "body" : "I support service which provide transactions history for users and accept their transactions for sending to network through bitcoind. Sometimes by some reason users transactions stuck for long time (very small percent). While blockexplorers kick users transactions from their mempool (which looks for users that their transaction not exists anymore), bitcoind which used by service still hold it. Previously for removing such transactions I was need stop bitcoind, remove `mempool.dat` and start bitcoind again. This is not good way for removing just 1 transaction from whole mempool. With this new RPC command removing stuck tx from mempool will be much easier.",
