I actually had misremembered how this works myself, thinking that `whitelistforcerelay` only applied to the relay treatment of invalid transactions, rather than ones that might already be in the mempool.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would also be helpful to update the text for `-whitelistforcerelay`, to indicate that has to be set to true in order for transactions already in the mempool to be relayed as well?  I guess that's a special case of \"violate local relay policy\", so maybe unnecessary.",
