That formula has only changed a couple times over the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe most recent [change](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/32552) was to fix compiling with Xcode 10, which is just applying [this patch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/formula-patches/4c55b1/berkeley-db%404/clang.diff). That patch is equivalent to what we apply in [depends](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/598323911e930d67e678e464353eb570ad3bf2b7/depends/packages/bdb.mk#L17), and that we download in [contrib/install_db4.sh](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/598323911e930d67e678e464353eb570ad3bf2b7/contrib/install_db4.sh#L68).\r\n\r\nIs it possible that you've (re)installed `berkeley-db`, or compiled with outdated Xcode/command line tools/macOS headers installed, and that could be the cause of the issue?\r\n\r\nDo you have a copy of that `A` env that others could test with? \r\n\r\n> If nobody can reproduce this, I might try nuking and reinstalling Homebrew entirely.\r\n\r\nI'd hold off on doing that (unless you have an easy way to reset to your current installed packages etc). What's the output of `brew doctor`?\r\nCan you try completely removing and installing `berkeley-db` and check if the issue persists?",
