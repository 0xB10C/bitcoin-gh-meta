I agree that the mempool should accept and relay txs with outputs to any segwit version.\r\n\r\n> It violates BIP173 (\"Version 0 witness addresses are always 42 or 62 characters, but implementations MUST allow the use of any version.\"), though admittedly this code was written before BIP173.\r\n\r\nThis isn't relevant to the change here. BIP173 describes an address format and how to decode that into a scriptPubKey. The node/mempool has no concept of addresses.\r\n\r\nI think your last three points are actually arguments to not stop the wallet from sending to segwit v1+ addresses, rather than arguments to allow the mempool to accept/relay those txs.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to prevent the Bitcoin Core wallet from sending to v1+ addresses, or at least to warn. We can't prevent all classes of sending insecure or unspendable addresses, but I think it makes sense to do so when we can.\r\n\r\nI think the main concern that people have with that is that it might slow down segwit v1 adoption. I disagree - bech32 adoption has mostly been slowed down by large exchanges or other services not implementing send-to-bech32. That's something that is outside our control.",
