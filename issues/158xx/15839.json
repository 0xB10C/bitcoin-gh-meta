It seems like we've turned up several additional bugs that slipped through initial review (see #15776, #15834), and given the potential severe consequences of these bugs I think it'd make more sense for us to delay releasing this code until 0.19.\r\n\r\nSince the bugfix PRs are getting review, I think we can leave #14897 in master, but we can separately discuss if it should be reverted in master as well if anyone thinks that would be more appropriate.",
