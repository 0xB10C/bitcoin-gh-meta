Running with `m_tx_relay_force_flush` will achieve exactly the same except that wait will be much shorter.\r\n\r\nNotably, I don't think there are any tests in the functional test suite that explicitly test the poisson distribution for tx relay. Really, that should be tested at the unit test level. We could add a single functional test with `m_tx_relay_force_flush` disabled if we want a higher-level test that simply tests that tx relay is not completely broken.\r\n\r\n> I really don't like special casing the tests like this\r\n\r\nIn general I agree, but the change here is so minor that I think it's ok. I'm much more concerned about other shortcomings in our functional test suite, such as not having peers outbound peers or peers on non-local network addresses.\r\n\r\n> Wouldn't it be better to run some of these tests in parallel\r\n\r\nThat's already the default",
