   "body" : "This fixes two bugs:\r\n\r\n1. The prune setting range was set *after* loading the current value. If users had a prune of (eg) 200, it would get limited to 99 before the range was raised. This is fixed by setting the range first.\r\n2. The prune setting was limited to <= the chainparams' \"assumed blockchain size\". There's no reason for this limit (the UX is the same either way), and there are use cases it breaks (eg, setting a prune size such that it begins pruning at some future point). Therefore, I raised it to the max value.\r\n\r\nThis is a daggy fix, so should cleanly merge to both master and 0.18 branches.",
