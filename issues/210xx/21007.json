   "body" : "This adds a `-daemonwait` flag that does the same as `-daemon` except that it, from a user perspective, backgrounds the process only after initialization is complete. This is similar to the behaviour of some other software such as c-lightning.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful when the process launching bitcoind wants to guarantee that either the RPC server is running, or that initialization failed, before continuing. The exit code indicates the initialization result.\r\n\r\nThis replaces the use of the libc function `daemon()` by a custom implementation which is inspired by the glibc implementation, but also creates a pipe from the child to the parent process for communication.\r\n\r\nAn additional advantage of having our own `daemon()` implementation is that no MACOS-specific pragmas are needed anymore to silence a deprecation warning.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Factor out `token_read` and `token_write` to an utility, and use  them in `shutdown.cpp` as wellâthis is exactly the same kind of communication mechanism.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Improve granularity of the `configure.ac` checks. This currently  still checks for the function `daemon()` which makes no sense as  it's not used. It should check for individual functions such as\r\n  `fork()` and `setsid()` etc.\r\n\r\n- [ ] I wonder if it makes sense to use this in the RPC tests.",
