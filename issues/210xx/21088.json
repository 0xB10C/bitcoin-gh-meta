Guix switched back from using CPATH to C{,PLUS}_INCLUDE_PATH as the\r\n   way to indicate #include search paths.\r\n2. GCC's library is now split into a separate output, whereas before it\r\n   was included in the default output. This means that our gcc toolchain\r\n   packages need to propagate that output.\r\n3. A few package versions were bumped\r\n```",
