   "body" : "This is the first 4 commits of #20833, and does refactoring only. It should be relatively simple to review, and offers a few nice things:\r\n- It makes accessing values that don't make sense (e.g. fee) when the tx is invalid an error.\r\n- Returning `MempoolAcceptResult` from ATMP makes the interface cleaner. The caller can get a const instead of passing in a mutable \"out\" param.\r\n- We don't have to be iterating through a bunch of lists for package validation, we can just return a `std::vector<MempoolAcceptResult>`.\r\n- We don't have to refactor all ATMP call sites again if/when we want to return more stuff from it.",
