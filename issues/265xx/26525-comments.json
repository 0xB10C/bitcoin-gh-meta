Even if we pulled 24.0, users could still just run 24.0rc4 which is functionally identical to 24.0 (the final release is just the last rc with the version number updated).\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this option is default false.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIn regards to \"no technical reason\", I think the recent mempool situation perfectly illustrates why full RBF is useful. Users whose previously high feerate non-opt-in RBF transactions may have suddenly become low priority due to a sudden increase in transaction volume and subsequent rise in feerates. For such users, full RBF would allow them to bump their transactions to higher feerates in order to be confirmed in a timeframe closer to what they had expected with their original feerate.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIf I see continued brigading or trolling of this thread, it will be locked.

As such, this PR would only be included in 25.0+ or 24.1, which, as I understand it, defeats the purpose of removing the option. Users who want the option could just run 24.0. Even if we pulled 24.0, users could still just run 24.0rc4 which is functionally identical to 24.0 (the final release is just the last rc with the version number updated).\n\nI cannot let a false rigidity in the current process be an argument for a change that is potentially this disruptive and contrary to the Bitcoin we use today. This is a special circumstance in that it may affect an abnormally high quantity of transactions by opting them into a new behavior they did not choose.\n\nIt is also special in that the users it affects are not familiar with the process or how to interface with Bitcoin Core.\n\nIt took me roughly 40 hours of research and debate to fully understand the issues at play here, how to explain them, what my options are for helping, and then how to execute this work... An extremely high bar. \n\nMeanwhile the process ignored the controversy. \n\nThere are no rules set in stone for process and I hope Bitcoin Core can accommodate a need to be agile when appropriate.\n\n\n> Please keep in mind that this option is default false.\n\nWhy add it all then?\n\n> In regards to \"no technical reason\", I think the recent mempool situation perfectly illustrates why full RBF is useful. \n\nAs Sergej noted, even full RBF cannot guarantee inclusion in a congested mempool. When analyzed this is actually an extremely edge case (that could be addressed at the wallet level, allowing zero-conf to persist as an opt-in service) where you have only users that did not use an rbf wallet, did not include a sufficient fee, did not have a change output to cpfp, did not have a recipient willing to cpfp, and did not get dropped from the mempool yet.\n\n> If I see continued brigading or trolling of this thread, it will be locked. Consider yourselves warned.\n\nI would appreciate a little bit of patience here, I am not trying to attract trolls, I am trying to be heard and give non-Bitcoin-Core-dev users a chance to have a voice. This may result in some noise but I do not want my effort to help to be undermined by outsiders. \n",

I think there is no conceptual consensus among the Bitcoin Core project and wider community to deploy `mempoolfullrbf` option, neither there is consensus to remove it.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, I think the path should be to rebuild long-term conceptual consensus among all the community stakeholders on Core's policy design and release process to advance the situation either in the status quo of pre-#25600 or towards a coordinated fullrbf deployment. On the conceptual-side, I think the philosophy proposing a [policy regime](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021135.html) for each non-interfering Bitcoin use-case should be given more considerations, either to ground it or invalidate it. There is also a more open question, if Core should have a say at all in [policy settings](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021116.html) (some today are hardcoded and no one as ever asked to change them like `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`), or we should defer more and more flexibility towars the users in the future. Or even if conflicting transaction monitoring should be addressed by introducing a [new P2P protocol.](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021142.html)\r\n\r\nOn the procedural-side, I think one learning of the previous weeks of discussions is the necessity of encompassing the concerns of all the affected class of Bitcoin community stakeholders in the design of policy changes (merchants/second-layers operators/wallets/etc). I think not only by outreaching by default the known public communication channels and community process (e.g the Optech newsletter, the BOLT process, the LSP specification process, etc), but also by giving more leeway and time in each step of design and deployment. How much this \"policy design\" process should be formalized or tacit, I don't know. It's an open question to answer in the future.\r\n\r\nFrom my belief, before we have addressed those concerns and lessons of the past weeks, I don't think it's worthy to open\r\nmore `mempoolfullrbf` removal PRs. Addressing them in the coming future are none of my current Bitcoin Core engineering priorities, there are a lot of issues drawing my time in the Lightning space such as making LDK more secure or advancing in solving channel jamming. Glad if we see more contributors or users working on the issues of transaction-relay/mempool policy and anyone is free to steer the effort forward, in a respectful and patient fashion according to Bitcoin protocol development standards.",

First hearing about this controversy, my knee-jerk reaction was \"the mempool can't be trusted; that's why we need PoW at all\", but having given it further thought:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Yes, accepting unconfirmed transactions is, and always has been, risky. I wouldn't do it myself. But it's not my place, or the place of anyone else, to prevent, or even 'disincentivise', others making that choice. If they choose to accept an unconfirmed transaction and get double-spent, they're only hurting themselves.\r\n> 2. Users not knowing about RBF and ending up with a non-RBF TX stuck in the mempool for a long time is not a Bitcoin Core concern. It's a wallet concern. Wallets should flag RBF by default, or explicitly ask the user what they want per TX/on initialization.\r\n> 3. Users accepting unconfirmed transactions unwittingly aren't going to be prevented from doing so by full RBF. Again, wallet space.\r\n> \r\n> I've not really heard any other arguments, besides mempool-split brain and issues w/ CoinJoin & multiparty contracts, but it doesn't seem full-RBF actually fixes that.\r\n> \r\n> Besides that, no, an unreleased piece of code is not 'status quo'. It's true that replacement of non-RBF transactions is already possible, but making it far easier with full-RBF is objectively _not_ 'maintaining the status quo'.\r\n> \r\n> More than happy to hear other justifications for it. If there's an actual tehcnical benefit to full-RBF, then we should adopt it _by default_. But honestly this whole thing feels quite political.\r\n> \r\n> Edit: And to add, I think _making_ it a concern of Bitcoin core to 'disincentivise unsafe behaviour' is a huge mistake. It's taking on an additional responsibility you simply do not have at the moment, with potentially unlimited scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreat people like fools, you will attract foolishness.\r\nTreat people like responsible individuals, and you will get responsible behaviour and encourage learning.\r\n",

And yes, it is fully the naive merchant's responsibility to deal with the consequences of making bad security assumptions. However, what this PR suggests is to prevent casual users who are probably not attempting to maliciously double spend from performing a tx replacement. The security of accepting 0-conf transactions will not change with or without -mempoolfullrbf, it was insecure, and it will continue to be insecure.\r\n\r\nNo one is preventing merchants from continuing to accept this risk.\r\n\r\n> Users not knowing about RBF and ending up with a non-RBF TX stuck in the mempool for a long time is not a Bitcoin Core concern. It's a wallet concern. Wallets should flag RBF by default, or explicitly ask the user what they want per TX/on initialization.\r\n\r\nCorrect, mostly a UX concern. I fail to see how this is an argument that supports removing the default off -mempoolfullrbf option.

Each node and all businesses already had the option to toggle with RBF depending on their needs and preferences.\n\nThe thing that making RBF default for all nodes does is it meddles with the fee market way too much at the cost of introducing this convenience, because accepting 0 conf transactions was a matter of individual user and merchant decisions and for each specific transaction, which in my opinion is a reasonable bet because chain reorgs are not that common and are probabilistic (no human can cheat their way into reorgs).\n\nTaking away this option from users and businesses forces them to not use Bitcoin L1 for simple daily high volume transactions and forces them to rely on LN; not necessarily a bad thing but disturbing the fee market to a huge extent is a heavy cost to consider. \n\nKey question is what is the need for switching from the current default? Convenience, at the cost of disturbing the fee market and spoiling the user experience of not being able to accept 0 conf transactions, unless explicitly opted into? \n\nIts already present as a feature for users and businesses that want it and the change has unneeded costs.",

I don't have much to add here, other than to say that I don't think the protocol development questions I raised on the mailing list and in #26438 have been addressed in an adequate way, and I think the next time someone proposes a change to an opt-in policy (whether that be eliminating opt-in RBF/opt-in non-replacement by default, or adding a new opt-in regime like the v3 proposal, or any other proposal where some transactions are processed under different policy rules than others) we should have a thoughtful discussion that addresses the points I've raised.",

      "body" : "ACK.\r\n\r\nThe only arguments against this I've seen are:\r\n1. **Unconfirmed transactions are unsafe to accept.**\r\n   The configuration flag doesn't improve anything on this front. 'I don't like the fact businesses are willing to accept the current risk profile' is not a good reason to encourage a change to mempool policy, even if you think they don't properly understand the risks. That's on them.\r\n    This argument lays the responsibility of preventing end-user bad practice with the Bitcoin Core team. This is not a current responsibility for the Bitcoin Core team, and has potentially unlimited scope. Taking on such responsibility should be actively avoided.\r\n2. **RBF is good.**\r\n    Yes, RBF is good. And we already have it. Conflating full-RBF with RBF as a whole is a misguided at best, disingenuous at worst argument.\r\n\r\n    2a. **People might accidentally/unknowingly broadcast a non-RBF transaction and get stuck in the mempool.**\r\n        This is just a variant of the 'RBF is good' argument.\r\n        This is a wallet-space issue. Wallets should, by default, enable RBF, or ask the user at TX or wallet initialization time. There is no reason for Bitcoin Core to address this issue further. Bitcoin Core already addresses the issue of stuck transactions: users can flag RBF on individual transactions. There is no trade-off, unless they are paying someone who accepts zero-conf, in which case, stuck transactions are not an issue.\r\n3. **Status quo (we already merged this config flag).**\r\n    The status quo is defined by what nodes are _actually running_ in production. An unreleased change is simply not the status quo.\r\n4. **User choice.**\r\n    This PR does not meaningfully remove user choice. Users can still choose to flag RBF on their transactions. Setting this config flag to 1 does not benefit a user unless others do so too, and even then, anybody setting this configuration value is aware enough and capable enough to flag RBF on their transactions. This is not a question of individual, self-sovereign choice. Users already have the individual, self-sovereign choice to flag RBF. This is a question of changing mempool policy, and forcing that choice on other users.\r\n    If we _really_ want to change mempool policy, we should do so. If there is technical value in full-RBF, we should adopt it. This configuration flag is a mechanism to adopt it without justifying its technical merits. The mempool is not part of the consensus layer, but mempool policy can have a significant impact on end-users whether they opt in or not. Changes to mempool policy should be made _very_ carefully, and at this point, I do not believe the change this PR reverts was made with an appropriate level of care.\r\n5. **People could adopt this change anyway/full-RBF is inevitable.**\r\n    OK, so why pre-emtively, needlessly support a configuration flag? The inclusion of this flag is an implicit suggestion users should use it. There are Core developers being very explicit and very vocal that users should use it. My question is why, and I've not received an answer I find satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMore than happy to change my mind if someone is willing to engage meaningfully. I already did so once.\r\n\r\n**Main reason I've decided to actively ACK:**\r\n\r\n**It seems to me the concern about mempool split-brain is a legitimate concern, but full-RBF does not resolve that, and full-RBF via a default-off configuration flag will result in _more_ split-brain, putting those who aren't aware of this configuration flag, or what it means, at increased risk.**",
