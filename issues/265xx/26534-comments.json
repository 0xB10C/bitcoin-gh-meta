      "body" : "> Since fsync doesn't do the whole job, it shouldn't silence the error/return-false when F_FULLFSYNC fails.\r\n\r\nSorry, I was unclear. (I'll edit my comment.) `fsync` does eventually physically write to disk on macOS, but it just does it on its own time. It's more vulnerable to corruption / data loss if, for example, the machine or drive loses power. The `F_FULLFSYNC` option is better just because it actually physically writes *immediately* after it flushes to disk. Prior to #3000, the macOS version just used `fsync`. This PR goes back to using `fsync` if the (better) `F_FULLFSYNC` isn't available. \r\n\r\n> And if, as you say, some drives claim to have done it while they actually haven't, should we perhaps consider falling back to fsync even if F_FULLFSYNC succeeds?\r\n\r\nSome drives claim to write immediately with the `fcntl F_FULLFSYNC` call, but in reality only do the equivalent of macOS's version of `fsync` -- that is, they just flush to disk, return ASAP, and let the disk actually physically write whenever it wants, rather than blocking until the physical write is complete.\r\n\r\n> Or maybe F_FULLFSYNC always at least does the equivalent of fsync?\r\n\r\nI think that's what happens for the drives that 'lie', which is what I just talked about. However, I don't think any actual flushes or physical writes happen if `F_FULLFYNC` returns an error.",
