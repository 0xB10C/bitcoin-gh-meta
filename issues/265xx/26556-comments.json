We can always remove the board later on if it isn't utilized.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if this ends up in a similar state as the current high-prio board (i.e. a bit under utilized). The \"problem\" doesn't seem to be the visibility of (high-prio) PRs to review but rather that contributors follow their own interest in choosing what to review. The new board you are suggesting might solve this dilemma as it's not on the maintainers to maintain it and contributors can curate it with all the high-prio PRs they find interesting.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to change the ordering on these boards? For example, ordering by \"how long has this been open\" or \"most recently active\" would seem more useful than letting contributors pick the order.",
