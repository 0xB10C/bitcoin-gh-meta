   "body" : "The objects `CNode`, `CNodeState` and `Peer` store different info about a peer - `InitializeNode()` and `FinalizeNode()` make sure that for the duration of a connection, we should always have one of each for a peer.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no situation in which, as part of getpeerinfo RPC,  `GetNodeStateStats()` (which requires a `CNodeState` and a `Peer` entry for a `NodeId` to succeed)  could fail for a legitimate reason while the peer is connected - this can only happen if there is a race condition between peer disconnection and the `getpeerinfo` processing (see also a more detailed description of this in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26457#pullrequestreview-1181641835). \r\n\r\nBut in this case I think it's better to just not include the newly disconnected peer in the response instead of returning just parts of its data. If we do this, we can make a bunch of fields non-optional that were optional before without any advice to the user why they might sometimes be missing. It also allows future reordering of fields between  `CNode`, `CNodeState` and `Peer` without having to worry about breaking things by making non-optional fields optional.\r\n\r\nIf this gets approval, `bitcoin-cli -netinfo` could probably be simplified as a follow-up because it wouldn't need to deal with missing entries for some of these fields anymore.\r\n\r\n(to avoid possible confusion, this is **not** intended for 24.0)",
