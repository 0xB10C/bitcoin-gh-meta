BTC client made a new wallet.dat file\r\n\r\nI think I'm able to reproduce this. It looks like #11862 might be causing your wallet config argument to be ignored. Do you see this warning?\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Config setting for -wallet only applied on test network when in [test] section.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> On version 0.17.0 i read what i can use full pathes to wallet files.\r\n\r\nWe might need to clarify release notes, but this isn't true. You can only specify full paths to wallet directories not wallet files. (Originally this was possible, but it was deemed too [dangerous](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11687#issuecomment-344381289) because it might mislead people into creating incomplete backups of wallets).",
