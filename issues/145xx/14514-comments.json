Don't think this would change anything, deprecating something would still break support for the old versions of the config file, no matter if it has an explicit version number or provides an option that no longer exists.\r\n\r\nAlso I think this would be confusing for users and developers alike. Do you have any example of other software which uses configuration versioningÃ¢ÂÂin this senseÃ¢ÂÂsuccessfully?",
