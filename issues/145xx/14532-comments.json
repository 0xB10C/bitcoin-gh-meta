The privacy is leak happens with the `SYN`/`ACK` response.\r\n\r\n**Second: the attack surface aspect**\r\n\r\nEven if we are not providing any services to unknown clients (due to `!ClientAllowed(Ã¢ÂÂ¦)`) weÃ¢ÂÂre still providing adversaries on network `B` and `C` an unnecessary attack surface by listening on those networks.\r\n",
