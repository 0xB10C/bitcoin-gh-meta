Wait until it has completely\n-shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\n-installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n-or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n-\n-If your node has a txindex, the txindex db will be migrated the first time you run 0.17.0 or newer, which may take up to a few hours. Your node will not be functional until this migration completes.\n-\n-The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\n-new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\n-depending on the speed of your machine.\n-\n-Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\n-automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\n-directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\n-However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\n-\n-Downgrading warning\n--------------------\n-\n-The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\n-releases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\n-older version, you will need to run the old release with the `-reindex-chainstate`\n-option to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.\n-\n-If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\n-processing the entire blockchain.\n-\n-Compatibility\n-==============\n-\n-Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\n-the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer (Windows XP is not supported).\n-\n-Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\n-frequently tested on them.\n-\n-From 0.17.0 onwards macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't\n-support versions of macOS older than 10.10.\n-\n-Known issues\n-============\n-\n-...\n-\n Notable changes\n ===============\n \n-...\n+An issue was solved with OSX dmg generation, affecting OSX 10.12 to 10.14,",
