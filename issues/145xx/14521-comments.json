There's a screen for \"About Qt\" under `Help` that you might want to look at? Although I still don't see the purpose for this.  Please do not keep trying to change trivial, unnecessary things for Bitcoin Core, it's just a waste of devs time for more important improvements. \r\n",

I certainly think so. \r\nAnd in the process, Bitcoin Core gets many small improvements in areas where more experienced devs rarely work. It's a win-win!  \r\n\r\nIf \"trivial\" PRs take too much time for devs, we have a delegation problem. Reviewing \"trivial\" PRs could and should be delegated appropriately.  Please don't scare away newcomers that want to (learn how to) contribute. I am one them. \r\n\r\n ",
