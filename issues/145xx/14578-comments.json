Certain 150 outputs is not a problem in general, but if you need 1000s of inputs to pay that much, then yes. Sorry, nothing Bitcoin Core can do about that.\r\n\r\n> You should get a failure on the entire batch of payments in both cases.\r\n\r\nBatches are not atomic. They're executed one by one. Changing that would require a major redesign of how the RPC system works.\r\n\r\n> What should happen, is the daemon should process each transaction that it can, but fail only the one transaction with the problem.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is reasonable for `sendmany`, and perhaps not. I think it's generally safer to fail as much as possible when part of the input is invalid (in line with your earlier request, except we can't do it across RPC calls). It certainly isn't reasonable in general (for example, if that's what we'd do for `createrawtransaction` you'd end up paying the failed amounts as fee!).\r\n\r\nReally, I think there is no solution except validating your inputs.",
