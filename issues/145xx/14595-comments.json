I first tried to add `blocksdir` under sections [main] and [test]. This doesn't work. And having a global `blocksdir` doesn't work either.\r\n\r\nI have an additional issue with regtest. I want to keep the default data directory but when I run bitcoind, it will create an empty blocks folder at the root of the bitcoin directory in addition to a blocks folder in the regtest directory. It seems that bitcoind in regtest will first search for a blocks dir as if it was on mainnet. It forces me to plug my external hard drive even if I work on regtest.\r\nSpecifying `datadir` or `blocksdir` in [regtest] to avoid this unwanted behavior doesn't work.\r\n\r\n",
