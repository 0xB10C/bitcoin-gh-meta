I think a good compromise would be a `-backupdir` option, which would *default* to inside the datadir but can be anywhere (even `/` if you want the current behavior).\r\n\r\nIMO ideally there would be no RPCs that write to server-side storage at all. Any backups could be streamed over HTTP and backed up client side. That said, that would be a much larger API as well as code change.\r\n\r\n@practicalswift btw `backupwallet` is missing from your list?",

For `dumptxoutset`, we could just say \"use REST instead\", but wallet features really need authentication and a trusted interface.\r\n\r\nWe could hex-encode the backup, but that's ugly and (in a simple implementation) uses more memory than it really should. A quick search doesn't turn up anything for \"attachments\" on JSON-RPC responses. :/",
