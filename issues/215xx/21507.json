   "body" : "Implements the lockinontimeout parameter and MUST_SIGNAL phase of BIP 8, along with some tests. This PR is largely the non-refactor portions of #19573.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the lockinontimeout parameter is made configurable through a `-vblot` command line option as has been suggested by many people. Note that no attempt is made to have lockinontimeout=true or lockinontimeout=false nodes try to find peers with the same policy. However nodes that set `-vblot` will have a user agent comment indicating this.\r\n\r\nBuilt on #21392 for the change to height based version bits, and #21399 for the renames.",
