Seems useful as an RPC command.\r\n\r\nIt could, or a third path could be to add a boolean `totals` arg to the `getnodeaddresses` RPC to toggle a \"totals mode\" (that said, it might be a bit obscure/hard to discover).\r\n\r\nGenerally, CLI commands batch or wrap one or multiple RPC commands and are easier to change and improve without worrying about API stability. For example, this might evolve to returning other address info or statistics. In this case where only one RPC is wrapped, instead of batching multiple RPCs like `-getinfo`, `-netinfo` and `-generate` do, I don't have a strong opinion on the RPC vs CLI question.",
