   "body" : "This PR aims to reduce addr blackholes. When we receive an `addr` message that contains 10 or less addresses, we forward them to 1-2 peers. This is the main technique we use for self advertisements, so sending to peers that wouldn't relay would effectively \"blackhole\" the trickle. Although we cannot prevent this in a malicious case, we can improve it for the normal, honest cases, and reduce the overall likelihood of occurrence. Two known cases where peers would not participate in addr relay are if they have connected to you as a block-relay-only connection, or if they are a light client. \r\n\r\nThis implementation defers initialization of `m_addr_known` until it is needed, then uses its presence to decide if the peer is participating in addr relay. For outbound (not block-relay-only) peers, we initialize the filter before sending the initial self announcement when processing their `version` message. For inbound peers, we initialize the filter if/when we get an addr related message (ADDR, ADDRV2, GETADDR, SENDADDRV2).\r\n\r\nMarking as draft until I add/fix functional tests.\r\n",
