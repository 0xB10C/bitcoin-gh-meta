Are you overclocking any pieces to the point that instabilities come out because of how taxing bitcoin can be?\r\n\r\nYes I'm quite sure my hardware is not \"taxed\" :)\r\n\r\nResource manager showed less than 10% hard memory usage (I have 48GB of RAM).  Additionally, the error doesnt happen if I simply lower or remove the dbcache parameter.  The problem is that there is an assert somewhere which blocks the debugger from breaking at the issue, so it's effectively masked.  \"out of memory\" is not a string constant anywhere, at least not one that Visual Studio could find.\r\n\r\n",
