Unknown wallet records: 0\r\n```\r\nWith this change, wallet names can be misinterpreted as a logging category.\r\n\r\n> and I would be willing to create a follow-up PR to cleanup that redundancy.\r\n\r\nI think those changes should just be part of this PR. For anyone running with `logthreadnames` this change is going to result in output like the following:\r\n```bash\r\n2021-02-08T02:34:43Z [init] [http] Starting HTTP server\r\n2021-02-08T02:34:43Z [init] HTTP: starting 4 worker threads\r\n2021-02-08T02:34:43Z [http] [http] Entering http event loop\r\n...\r\n2021-02-08T02:34:54Z [torcontrol] [tor] tor: Error connecting to Tor control socket\r\n2021-02-08T02:34:54Z [torcontrol] [tor] tor: Not connected to Tor control port 127.0.0.1:9051, trying to reconnect\r\n```",
