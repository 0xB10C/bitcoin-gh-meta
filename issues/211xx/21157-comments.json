Only connecting out over Tor is more private of course when you combine it with no reachable IPv4/IPv6 address, in particular if you want to broadcast transactions without them being correlatable with your IP.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you only make random Tor connections, you're much more vulnerable to Sybil attacks (as Tor addresses have 0 cost to create, an attacker can just flood the network with 1000s of apparent Tor Bitcoin nodes, and have a high probability of receiving all outbound Tor connections a Tor-only node makes). This is significantly less a concern with IPv4/IPv6 (especially with asmap) due to cost of getting IPs in many networks. It's also less a concern if you have `-addnode`d connections to trusted peers (even if they're onion addresses).",

      "body" : "I would also refactor this whole section:\r\n- Current bullet formatting looks akward\r\n- Change the title so that a common naming format can be used if we want to add a guide for another system\r\n  - From: `Example: creating an onion service on Debian/Ubuntu Systems`\r\n  - To: `Setup Guide: Debian/Ubuntu`\r\n- Better explanations per each step \r\n\r\nHere is how that would look. This is just a rough suggestion, so make contextual additions as you see fit:\r\n\r\n## Setup Guide: Debian/Ubuntu\r\n\r\nAssuming you already have an installation of Bitcoin Core:\r\n\r\n##### 1. Install Tor:\r\n\r\nTo install Tor, run:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo apt install tor\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 2. Edit Tor configuration file:\r\n\r\nopen up the `torrc` file with your favorite text editor, this example uses the `nano` text editor:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo nano /etc/tor/torrc\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit the `torrc` file so that it has these settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nControlPort 9051\r\nCookieAuthentication 1\r\nCookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 3. Add user to Tor group:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo usermod -a -G debian-tor satoshi\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 4. Restart Tor\r\n\r\nTo restart Tor, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo systemctl restart tor\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 5. Edit Bitcoin configuration file\r\n\r\nOpen up the `bitcoin.conf` file with your favorite text editor.\r\nEdit the file so that it contains these settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlisten=1\r\ntorcontrol=127.0.0.1:9051\r\ndebug=tor\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 6. Confirmation\r\nYou should be all set up to run a node through the Tor Network.\r\nYou can confirm that everything is setup correctly by running the `getnetworkinfo` \r\nRPC command. The result should look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocaladdresses\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"address\": \"omy7kj7zwvfg5luayideh73uqb2latkoyyy5h65y4atv3fymnlxlzwqd.onion\",\r\n    \"port\": 8333,\r\n    \"score\": 4\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n",
