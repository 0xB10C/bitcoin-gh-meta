Many-- probably most-- are not observed on a daily or weekly basis.  If the network ends up in a bad state it may be difficult to recover nodes even manually if it is full of other nodes which are non-functional.\r\n\r\nWhen users do \"manually\" intervene, the results are not always pretty--  I've consoled more than one user through a thousands of dollars loss because in their efforts to 'fix' a 'stuck' node that wasn't actually stuck (e.g. when they were confused at the 0.99x progress display) and managed to delete or corrupt every copy of their wallet due to trying random things and/or following bad advice online.  Any particular user isn't likely to footgun themselves, but if you make 50,000 users do so, a few probably will.\r\n\r\nI'm not particularly sure about the approach in this PR right now, but the general practice that nodes should fix themselves if reasonable and safely possible is a really good one.  The whole behaviour switching on IBD handling is a pile of gross hacks on top of a pile of gross hacks,  several of which were needed to resolve cases where the network could more or less just spontaneously fail as a result of the IBD behaviour (some of which were witnessed on testnet).\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have a stronger assurance that things will recover if they end up in that state but the tricky part is being equally confident that the various attacks that the IBD specific behaviour is intended to protect against are still protected against-- esp because no one reviewing this work may remember all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It will only escape if the stale block detection mechanism causes it to eventually find a working node-- but this will take an extremely long time because it's stale block connections are infrequent and intended to heal a partitioned node in a network of mostly okay nodes.  Not to heal a partitioned node in a network of mostly partitioned node.  (And if there are a relatively small number of functional nodes a dos attacker can focus all their resources on those).\r\n\r\n(there is an altcoin that appears to be undergoing something like this recently--  potentially caused without much of an attacker, but mostly just by an enormous number of new nodes coming online effectively dos attacking the network.  It's unclear how it got into this state, but essentially all reachable nodes (including apparently long running ones) are stuck in IBD.)\r\n\r\nI understand pstratem's PR would improve the situation particularly if it took days to get most of the listening network into this state because they'd also be falling out of it on their own before the network became saturated-- in that case disruption would be prevented entirely. But if the issue is triggered all at once, it helps less-- there is still disruption, but the disruption heals completely in two days rather than having partitioned nodes hanging around for however long it takes a significant minority to get fixed via more manual means (such as by spinning up a lot of new working nodes).\r\n\r\nI think this pattern would be more completely and crisply resolved by simply persisting the latching state across restarts.  New nodes would have problems joining in a network under attack, but that is already the case for a bunch of reasons... and a new node you can assume has an operator present to do something (so, for example, a hidden option to force ibd=false might be a useful resource).  I think persisting the latch also actually reflects the *intent* of the latch, it just didn't do that when the latch was introduce because persisting state takes extra work.\r\n",

Currently, if a node is switched off and then switched back on some time later, it'll start up in IBD until it catches up to the tip. This seems like good behaviour - we don't want to download transactions, relay our address, respond to getheaders, etc until we've caught back up. If you want other contributors to ACK this PR, you'll need to convince them that changing that behaviour is an improvement, and does not introduce any regressions/vulnerabilities/etc.",
