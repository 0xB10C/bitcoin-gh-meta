      "body" : "Ah, I didn't know there was no pointer arithmetic in `master`! I've played with a few variants:\r\n\r\n### Variant 1\r\n```cpp\r\n// 63,621,136.00 ns/op\r\nauto it = rv.begin();\r\nfor (uint8_t v: s) {\r\n    *it++ = hexmap[v >> 4];\r\n    *it++ = hexmap[v & 15];\r\n}\r\nassert(it == rv.end());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has basically has the same speed for me. `it` is basically a pointer in disguise, so I'm not sure anything is gained here. Having a simple `assert` after the loop is nice though.\r\n\r\n### Variant 2\r\n\r\nOr this, but it's a bit slower and not better in my opinion:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// 65,479,162.00 ns/op\r\nsize_t i = 0;\r\nfor (uint8_t v: s) {\r\n    rv[i++] = hexmap[v >> 4];\r\n    rv[i++] = hexmap[v & 15];\r\n}\r\nassert(i == rv.size());\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Variant 3\r\nOr another variant:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// 65,187,171.00 ns/op\r\nfor (size_t i = 0; i < rv.size(); i += 2) {\r\n    auto v = s[i / 2];\r\n    rv[i] = hexmap[v >> 4];\r\n    rv[i + 1] = hexmap[v & 15];\r\n};\r\n```\r\n",
