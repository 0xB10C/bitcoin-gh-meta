For other RPCs, we sometimes even keep  dysfunctional dummy-arguments around to avoid this. (`prioritisetransaction`)\r\n\r\n> And I would also suggest mentioning in the description of hash_or_height, that not using this command would print info for the best block.\r\n\r\nI'll do this with my next push!",
