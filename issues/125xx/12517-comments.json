While it catches the simple `/etc/hosts` change (which is limited to 1 IP per name), it is rather simple to setup a rogue DNS node that just returns IPs the attacker controls. This is part of the usual bootstrapping problem which is unsolved. You'll just have to trust your ISP, or whoever acts as your DNS server, not to tamper with Bitcoin related queries.",
