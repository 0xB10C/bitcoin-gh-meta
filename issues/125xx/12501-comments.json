      "body" : "@dooglus Thanks for the clarification.  I think it's important to mention 1 kilobyte in the tooltip since the field's label mentions \"per kilobyte\" specifically.\r\n\r\nMy feeling on ``weight units`` is that since they're not mentioned in the field's label that inclusion in the tooltip would be more likely to introduce confusion for those less-knowledgeable users, and so I'm inclined to think that this concept is probably best left in documentation.",
