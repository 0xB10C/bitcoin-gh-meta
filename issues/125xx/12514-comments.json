Turns out I was not using the HSSD so I moved it to the HSSD, and ran it, and it resync'd the already downloaded part lightning fast, and then I looked at debug window, and peers just kept on climbing higher and higher... I got over 150 peers!\r\n\r\nI looked at the version number and it is still the same, maybe a patch was applied or this is a snapshot and version number not yet updated.\r\n\r\nI closed  the client, ran the make install, and now I think I should be good...\r\n\r\nEDIT: Turns out I've screwed my previous resync, this is the second time I got over 50%. There has to be a better way, can it not just look and see the files are there and continue from last time?",
