Thanks for correcting me on that (I should have clued in that German's code should be \"de\" and not \"el\" -- I was thrown off by \"GR\").\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I can't approve something that I don't understand.  I'll ask someone to take a look at this and give you some suggestions on the git commands to use.  In the meantime, there's also the #github channel in irc.freenode.net which has a lot very helpful people as well (they've been a great help to me in the past).",
