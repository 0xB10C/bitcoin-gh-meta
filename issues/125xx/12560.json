A new keypool can be generated or the original one kept and new keys added to the keypool will come from the new HD seed.\r\n\r\nWallets that are not HD will be upgraded to be version FEATURE_HD_SPLIT when the `sethdseed` RPC command is used.\r\n\r\nI have also add some tests for this.\r\n\r\nAdditionally `-upgradewallet` can now be used to upgrade a wallet from non-HD to HD. When it is used for such an upgrade, the keypool will be regenerated.",
