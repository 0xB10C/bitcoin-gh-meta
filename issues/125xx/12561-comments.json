      "body" : "For context: I had a node go into an infinite loop, when a bit flip in a transaction in the block file caused the merkle root check to fail. It kept printing the same message, pegging the CPU at 100% but without advancing:\r\n```\r\n2018-02-27 07:47:02 ERROR: ConnectBlock: Consensus::CheckBlock: bad-txnmrklroot,\r\n hashMerkleRoot mismatch (code 16)\r\n2018-02-27 07:47:02 ERROR: ConnectTip(): ConnectBlock 0000000000000000003cd56ca3\r\ncf3dbc186ff3a6713f6972a11089b6ae4bf625 failed\r\n```\r\nIt might be due to software or hardware reasons (in my case, I found out in retrospect that the CPU was seriously overheating). In this kind of case it is better to give up and have the user manually check the issue, than try to continue.\r\n\r\n>  I think we might as well get rid of this call and assume that the corruption will eventually be detected later.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure removing the check is the best way forward. I'm happy that the corruption was detected as early as possible so I could take action and fix the CPU cooler. However, it could stop trying after one time, then give up. Or am I misunderstanding what this does?",
