This sounds like it is not correctly using poll anymore, which would be pretty bad.\r\n\r\n> bitcoind version is 0.17.0, OS is Linux.\r\n\r\nThat is a fairly old version, I'm doubtful anyone is too interested in reports on versions that old, though the code looks the same in current versions... this behaviour could change due to build system differences.\r\n\r\nSeveral other parts of the codebase also use \"\\_\\_linux\\_\\_\".",
