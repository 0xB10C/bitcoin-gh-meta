Also this is still just replacing the input of the child transaction and nothing to do with any ancestor? I was saying that the mempool acceptance code just ensures that ancestor inputs cannot be replaced and why does a function need to then check for them, I can't see how a pinning attack has anything to do with ancestors rather than just the child in question...",
