FRESH coins should be removed from a cache when they are spent, and this PR also stops us from fetching spent coins from a parent cache and marking them FRESH.\r\n\r\nThe PR improves commenting in coins.cpp|h, since there was some confusion around how the caches work. It also removes the 'pruned' terminology, which doesn't make sense since per-txout chainstate db was merged (#10195).",
