      "body" : "Thanks @icota for this cool PoC, that's really impressive but I do share Jonas opinion here. Better would be to spend time on process separation/interface cleaning/reusable library than pouring more stuff in one repository which would slow down development process of every component involved. It would be great for bitcoin ecosystem to reuse Core components like wallet utxo-management or fee-bumping if we turn them more library-like a la rust-lightning and avoid a lot of reinventing the wheel again and again. It's true they aren't easy piece of software to get right. \r\n\r\nEnforcing a specific runtime on users is a hazardous move given the huge diversity of use-cases. A mobile wallet is easier to build as one monolithic process whereas exchange maybe interested to have a micro-services approach for high-availability. And there is also resources-constrained, embedded devices where you're not going to run a full bitcoin stack on it. Running a full-node is already  bandwidth-expensive in a lot of places, not even mentionning mobile data plan. So IMO _modularity_ is a better way to serve a broad, diverse base of users/requirements.",
