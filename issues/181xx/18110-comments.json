This is because the C++ libraries and headers are missing from the musl include/library path. The existing libstdc++ is actually compatible with musl in most cases and could be used by copying it into the musl library path, but the C++ header files are usually not compatible. One option may be rebuilding just\r\n05:23 < wumpus> libstdc++ against musl; however, if C++ support is needed, it's recommended just to build a native toolchain targetting musl. \"\r\n05:35 < wumpus> I guess there's no way around using something like alpine linux\r\n06:22 < wumpus> effetctively, building C++ for musl requires a full cross toolchain; using a cross-compilation toolchain for the native platform, might be advantageous from a determinism perspective though\r\n06:26 < wumpus> insulated the build from what happens to be installed on the system\r\n07:04 < wumpus> dongcarl cfields what do you think about switching linux builds to musl libc static builds?\r\n07:10 < wumpus> it has the advantage that the binaries work pretty much everywhere instead of only on a limited range of libc versions, and it's starting to be untenable to maintain libc compatibility this far back\r\n07:17 < dongcarl> not opposed... with Guix we won't have to maintain libc compatibility, since we won't be forced to upgrade libc version by ubuntu... but I do see the binary works everywhere advantage\r\n07:18 < wumpus> sure, you can build against a old libc version instead of the libc-compat workaround, but you'd have just as much trouble supporting getauxval\r\n07:19 < wumpus> it doesn't exist in 2.11 no matter how you build against it\r\n",
