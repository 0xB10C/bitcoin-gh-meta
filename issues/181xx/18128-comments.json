I don't think we have to deal with users not knowing how to move an .app bundle form the downloads folder to the application folder.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it (the .zip approach) may simplify macOS app notarization.",

If people don't even read one-liner instructions then we can't help them. I think that also has a better chance of being read than a README file in the zip, the concept of a plain text README file is pretty weird to non-programmers. And I also feel like I have seen this more lately, as @jonasschnelli says, so I think it will not be foreign to most users. So Concept ACK from me.",
