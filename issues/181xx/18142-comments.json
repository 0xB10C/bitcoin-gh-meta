That way it can display a receive address without having to trust a connected computer to give it the right cosigner pubkeys.",

Maybe the wallet composition/proposal file should include information about communication channels for contacting each party?\r\n\r\nI would also worry about flexibility. There are many kinds of exotic wallets (including lightning) that should fit into this kind of model, but right now they require significant custom protocol development.\r\n\r\nI recognize this is \"kitchen sink\" style software that I'm proposing, but I do think there's value in thinking about the full lifecycle of a wallet and its users.",
