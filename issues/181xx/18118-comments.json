It seems like an unlikely scenario. I assume the Sybil attack can't motivate a restart.\r\n\r\nI guess this is not as bad as regular Culubas timejacking where nodes get a Sybil-attacked peer time that is 70 minutes in the past making them invalidate (for up to 70 minutes or may be longer?) blocks with times forwarded to the 120 minute limit, causing miners under those nodes to build on top of a chain that will lose and can be used for double spending.",
