It seems like an unlikely scenario. I assume the Sybil attack can't motivate a restart.\r\n\r\nI guess this is not as bad as regular Culubas timejacking where nodes get a Sybil-attacked peer time that is 70 minutes in the past making them invalidate (for up to 70 minutes or may be longer?) blocks with times forwarded to the 120 minute limit, causing miners under those nodes to build on top of a chain that will lose and can be used for double spending.\r\n\r\nI think peer time was always a mistake but Culubas said that if local time was the only time \"a disagreement among nodes of only a second or slightly longer (something that will happen as nodes gradually calibrate their clocks) could allow an attacker to split the network or isolate a node.\"  I don't see how that could be done.",
