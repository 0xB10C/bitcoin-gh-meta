(e.g. https://ma.ttias.be/enable-the-rpc-json-api-with-password-authentication-in-bitcoin-core/  )\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat unfortunate because exposing rpcbind to a local, physically secure network or via things like wireguard  are both fairly reasonable things to do.\r\n\r\nPerhaps renaming the option to something like  insecurerpcbind= might be effective?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, one could add an unauthenticated command \"shutdown\" to the rpc that allows a remote party to trigger the node to turn off and refuse to restart (e.g. creating a file called YOUR_RPC_PORT_IS_NOT_SECURE and refusing to start while that file exists) whenever a wildcard rpcbind is used, so if you fail to secure it at least some whitehat could come cleanly shut you off before something worse happens...\r\n\r\nOr, for a less nuclear alternative, instead of shutting down: triggering a periodic error log (and rpc status warning)   \"ERROR: Your RPC is not secured against connections from <triggering IP>.\"\r\n\r\n",
