The only other improvement this provides is better error reporting, but I think it would be better to just go through SelectCoins and improve its error reporting instead of pulling things out so that errors are reported elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are several benefits, (aside from what I wrote in the PR description):\r\n\r\n#### Sources Architecture:\r\n\r\n - Do make sense for you to be fetching, and verifying, coins in a function whose main responsibility is perform the Coin Selection process?\r\n \r\n    The Coin Selection should receive coins, and certain user/wallet parameters, so it can produce all the possible solutions for a certain target amount, picking and returning the best of them.\r\n\r\n\tJust imagine how this would looks like if Coin Selection would be a separated library (which, for its increasing specialization, could easily be one in the future). You would never include the pre-selected-inputs fetching and verification process into the Coin Selection responsibilities at all because cannot/shouldn't do it there.\r\n\r\n#### Tangible Improvements:\r\n\r\n1.  As we will do the pre-selected-inputs fetching and verification prior to calling `AvailableCoins`, if there is an error when the wallet fetches any of the preset-inputs, the transaction creation process can fail right away without calling `AvailableCoins` (Function that, as we know, walks-through the entire wallet's transactions map and performs all the internal available coins checks).\r\n \r\n     This prevents us from wasting resources that we are currently wasting for, literally, no reason.\r\n\r\n\tIn master, we are first looping-through the entire wallet's map inside  `AvailableCoins`, which is a resource intensive task if you have a big wallet, just to fail right after it finishes, discarding the coins result, because one of the pre-set inputs has an error.\r\n\r\n3.  If the user disallowed the \"other inputs selection\" by setting `m_allow_other_inputs=false` (which means: âno coins from the AvailableCoins result function will be used during Coin Selectionâ):â¨\r\n\r\n\tIn master: we loop-through the entire wallet's map inside `AvailableCoins` first, then we discard the computed result (because we will not use it..), then we fetch and use the pre-selected-inputs only.\r\n\tWhich is time and processing power wasted for no reason.\r\n\r\n\tIn this PR: we simply select the preset inputs, skip `AvailableCoins` if `m_allow_other_inputs=false` and provides them to `SelectCoins`.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n> but I think it would be better to just go through SelectCoins and improve its error reporting instead of pulling things out so that errors are reported elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe are currently failing inside the Coin Selection process due:\r\n* âInvalid pre-selected inputâ\r\n* âNot found pre-selected inputâ\r\n* âNot solvable pre-selected inputâ\r\n\r\nThese errors have nothing to do with the Coin Selection process. Why keep them there?\r\n\r\nIt's not that I located these errors on a random place. I placed them inside a \"Fetch Coins\" procedure whose main responsibility is fetch the coins that the user pre-selected and fetch the available coins in the wallet. Which seems totally reasonable for me.\r\n\r\nI mean, this errors have been obscured inside Coin Selection all this time, not being properly notified, because they should had never been placed there in the first place. It's all about a proper responsibility division to make the process clearer and cleaner so it's less error-prone (and in this case, in some occasions, actually faster and less resource consuming).",

Setting `m_allow_other_inputs=false` to disallow the wallet to include coins automatically.\r\n\r\n#### This is the result on this PR (tip f6d0bb2d):\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|        1,048,675.00 |              953.58 |    0.3% |      0.06 | `WalletCreateTransaction`\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n#### This is the result on current master (tip 4a4289e2):\r\n\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|       96,373,458.20 |               10.38 |    0.2% |      5.30 | `WalletCreateTransaction`\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\nThe benchmark took to run in master: **96.37 milliseconds**, while in this PR: **1 millisecond**  ð .",
