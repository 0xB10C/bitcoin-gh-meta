But this class contains all the essential things I think are missing from BResult: support for error values, support for void values, support for multiple errors, chained errors, and warnings.\r\n\r\nWas motivated to work on this by suggestion to use BResult in #25308 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25308#issuecomment-1181674645 and by #25601, which adds the same error type functionality this PR does, but doesn't support returning custom errors for error handling and returning standardized errors for error reporting at the same time.",
