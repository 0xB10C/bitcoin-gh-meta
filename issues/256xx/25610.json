   "body" : "The GUI currently opts in to RBF by default, but RPCs do not, and `-walletrbf` is default disabled. This PR makes the default in those two places to also opt in.\r\n\r\nThe last time this was proposed (#9527), the primary objections were the novelty at the time, the inability to bump transactions, and the gui not having the option to disable rbf. In the 5 years since, RBF usage has steadily grown, with ~27% of txs opting in. The GUI has the option to enable/disable RBF, and is also defaulted to having it enabled. And we have the ability to bump RBF'd transactions in both the RPC and the GUI. So I think it makes sense to finally change the default to always opt in to RBF.",
