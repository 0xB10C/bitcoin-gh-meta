      "body" : "hmm k thanks @hebasto, I do agree with laanwj there. Some contextual information wouldn't be bad for this.\r\nWe could change a bit the error description by adding something like \"invalid init argument value for %s bla bla\" so translators can infer what will be placed in %s better.\r\n\r\nSaying that, I'm good with any approach here. Pushed it merely because found it while was working on other things in the wallet.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would keep this PR scoped to the wallet module only (same as someone could tackle other points of #20404 scoped to other area of the sources), mainly to not end up conflicting with many PRs.\r\nOtherwise, the rebase work burden would be, by far, bigger than what it costed to do this tiny changes.",
