I missed this but the discussion there seems to be in line with what I found. Since there was no clear support for this approach I will close this here and maybe think about suggesting another solution.",

      "body" : "I think it's not ideal that the `-onlynet` help says that `Inbound and manual connections are not affected`, when they are in reality (by not advertising own addresses to these networks, making it unlikely for others to connect to us unless they knew our address before). \r\nSo, I'm not against this change, but I hadn't come to a final opinion either, because I think it might also be weird for a user to activate `-onlynet` and keep on advertising their clearnet address to the network, without a clear option to disable this or disable incoming connections from these networks. Maybe ideally, we'd have a way of specifying `-onlynet` separately for outbounds/inbounds/both, depending on what the user wants? \r\nIt might be good to discuss the broader direction in an issue, considering how frequently it comes up.",
