From the results of getpeerinfo or getnetworkinfo, a node operator can find full-rbf peers on the p2p network to which to manually connect to. The service flag bit select is the 26th one to be compatible with previous full-rbf [experiences](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-June/020570.html).\r\n\r\nIsn't this bad for privacy?",
