I don't think it is required, requesting LN users and some miners to use full RBF would be enough.\r\n\r\nWell that's a fundamental trade-off between signaling policy to ease peering and retaining information. I think the relevant question is this _additional_ information allow or significantly ease a concrete attack against node operator or funds safety. That said, even if the attack is qualified, the risk could be bearable by the operator, if the documentation is clear in that sense. E.g, in LN we recently specified out [zero-conf channels](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/910), they're coming with a lot of safety tradeoffs, though they're a UX improvement for sure.\r\n\r\n> Writing 'help' if lost on an island could result in 2 things:\r\n>    An aircraft or chopper notices and helps you\r\n>    Someone else finds you alone, looking for help, tries to exploit and kill you\r\n\r\nBeware life is risky :)\r\n\r\n> This is a good point which I did not consider earlier though I am not sure about announcing replacement transactions only to those peers.\r\n\r\nIn case of uncertain privacy/security risks, security-by-compartmentalization.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr \r\n\r\n> Edit: Or just mark it as a temporary service bit like existing usage does\r\n\r\nWell, I used the same experimental bit 26 than the patchset from @petertodd.

I think it raises an interesting question, in the sense of how as the Bitcoin Core project we should weight for a policy A or policy B offering different set of impacts on Bitcoin applications. In my opinion, the discussions can be tie-breaked on the hard physics of the system and recognizing there is no such thing as a global mempool in a distributed system therefore making assumptions on transactions ordering is inherently unsafe.\r\n\r\nAll of that to say I would like not to adopt a game theory reasoning framework, as ultimately game theory, at least zero-sum games, relies on the assumption of moves triggered by set of players in the pursuit of a gain, at the detriment of the other subsets. I'm thinking more of this change as a \"organic\" policy release engineering practice, namely giving the tools to the node operators to progressively activate full-rbf and build the full-rbf supporting routes. Even if we can assume a active subset of node operators quickly picking up the changes, social inertia being it won't happen overnight. This should give time for zero-conf transactions accepting services to either deprecate this mode of payment or moving to safe instant payments like LN or deploy (non-perfect) distributed mempools monitoring system.\r\n\r\nHowever, I acknowledge this is an ideal policy release practice, and adding automatic preferential peering might be too much a strong statement, or the timing is too short (let's give another buffer release before to introduce automatic preferential peering ?), or we should give more time to express technical dissent from zero-conf services providers or anyone else. Posting on the mailing list was done on this purpose.\r\n\r\nBeyond, I think this discussion is still interesting even in the lack of policy reversal like with full-rbf when we deploy new transaction-relay policy changes (e.g Erlay, package-relay, new RBF rules), we might firewall the new policy changes behind settings to observe first the performance, privacy-preserving or robustness properties of new features. We could clean up the added code complexity when we estimate the feature as mature.\r\n\r\nI think it's interesting to have a robust connectivity model of the p2p network, with factors like percentage `p` of nodes that need to support the new features and the chance threshold for success. I think we would enrich such model with the set of mempools miners among the let's say 10k listening peers (maybe Stratum v2 might change some assumptions ?). About false signaling, I think we might reduce it to buggy signaling and includes some factor `f`. I believe a mitigation against false signaling could be to run a scrapper testing the effectiveness of full-rbf and noting the peers address, however the dissemination of such information of \"misbehaving\" peers if relied on centralized/semi-centralized sources like DNS seeds is more likely to be more harmful than beneficial.",

Also, as per my review, connecting to a single full-RBF peer is insufficient to achieve good propagation.",
