You could always import your keys and descriptors into another wallet that's already loaded.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, wallets are independent containers. I don't think we should disallow what one wallet can contain just because another wallet is loaded that has the same things in it. This would also be easily bypassable by simply closing the other wallets before creating the duplicates.",
