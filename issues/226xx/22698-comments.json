Runtime of this test seems to be identical to what it was before this PR - I also should note this test turns out to be a really good benchmark for this PR as it is a pretty good worst-case scenario and stress test for doing tons of rbf signaling checks",

That's an issue regardless of what policy Bitcoin Core implements.\r\n\r\nI think the security issue is qualified in the consequences for downstream Bitcoin users of the code defect _compared_  to the standard. Such standard committed by Core in `doc/bips.md`.\r\n\r\nIn a decentralized system such as Bitcoin, I don't think we can admit an authoritative enumeration of the valid assumptions an application can draw on the p2p network. It's more constructive to argue in the way \"If we assume X, is Y safer, cheaper, easier-to-design ?\".\r\n\r\nIf we assume BIP152 to be widely deployed, block propagation is faster and overall network security better.\r\nIf we assume BIP330 to be widely deployed, transaction bandwidth consumption is better and cost-to-run a full-node lower.\r\nIf we assume BIP125 to be widely deployed,  LN security is better as LN nodes can adapt to mempools congestion.\r\n\r\nFollowing this reasoning, as protocol developers, I think we can rationally discuss about the benefits of assumptions for the wider ecosystem and even how to make them more \"binding\".",

I'm hoping this also makes it easier to reason about `PreChecks()` performance, and any potential for increased DoS surface.\r\n- improve performance, I believe `getrawmempool` (verbose) and `getmempoolentry` will run faster in all-cases (and possibly significantly faster in worst-case scenarios) than before this PR due to this optimization. But I think `PreChecks()` performance is probably more important, and more work is done in `PreChecks()` to check for inherited signaling after this PR -- so we need to ensure that is acceptable.",
