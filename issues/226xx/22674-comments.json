Specifically, in order to work around issues with potential package relay systems, @ariard suggested a somewhat complicated approach involving chaining spends and broadcasting conflicts to see which one confirms first. This avoids us having to implement the \"one on-chain output for future feerate bumping per open channel\" logic that others have, which is incredibly wasteful of on-chain space and also adds a lot of complexity for LDK's downstream users. If we can do replacement and multiple (no-onchain-parent) parents without a lot of complexity, it will save us a lot of heartache later. @sdaftuar suggested that it likely won't add a lot of complexity, so I suggested that to @glozow, who seemed to agree.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/issues/989",

Let's say you broadcast the package A+B+C+D+E, where A,B,C,D are commitment transactions and E a common CPFP. Previously, your malicious counterparty have submitted a better-feerate package A'+F to the network mempools. When your package {A,B,C,D,E} is sumbitted for acceptance, it will failed on the better-feerate requirement : https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fdd80b0a53b4af0b29cb6e03118e2456d053a757/src/validation.cpp#L830\r\n(fwiw, not documented in bip125).\r\n\r\nAs you don't know the failure reason from the honest LN node viewpoint, it's hard to decide on the next broadcast strategy. Either splitting the former package in X isolated one parent+child ones, because you suspect your counterparty to meddle with your transaction confirmation (similar to https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/803). Or attribute the failure to feerate efficiency w.r.t to top of of the mempool transactions.\r\n\r\nNote, your counterparty doesn't have to be malicious for your multiple parents package to fail confirmation. A honest counterparty can just have decided to go on-chain concurrently, with a better fee-estimation than you.\r\n\r\nOf course, I think this unsafety is only concerning in case of time-sensitive confirmations. If all your commitments are devoid of HTLC outputs, it's not time-sensitive anymore, and that's okay to have confirmation failure on the edge cases, not funds are loss, beyond the timevalue of liquidity.\r\n\r\nFurther, endorsing a Core dev hat, I would be pretty conservative with multiple-transaction p2p package. AFAIK, we already have DoS concerns to validate a _single_ transaction that would finally lead to mempool acceptance failure (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20277#issuecomment-754642226). IIRC we have not improved on this area due to a lack of an agreement on an efficient anti-DoS strategy against malicious transaction submission (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21224)\r\n\r\nIf we either make progress in this direction and start to penalize or slow-down heavy-package propagation, we might in the future break LN softwares which would have made assumptions on multiple-parent support. Note, this can also in a disaster scenario if we discover DoS vulns we would have thought out and the Core project don't have a formalized process in case of internal wreckage with significant security implications for downstream projects.\r\n\r\nSo back to a LN dev hat, I prefer to be conservative with the design of LDK anchor output backend and not make assumptions on potential multiple-parents support. For now, I think we already make far too assumptions on Core mempools behavior, without fully understanding all the implications. \r\n\r\nApart of the multi-parents point, I think the change proposed are okay. Though I would recall once again, imho it would be better to present a BIP draft on the ml for this serie of PRs, once for all to agree on a  consistent v0.1 package model, instead to all waste time on local discussions splitted across projects issues, slacks and irc...",

I think it's okay as long as you don't have time-sensitive unilateral closure, where a counterparty might interfere with the spending of one funding output also covered by the package to decrease the confirmation odds of all other channels closure.\r\n\r\n>  (assuming your safety assessment above for Lightning is correct)?\r\n\r\nPlease, would be great to have more eyes on this point. Note, iirc \"anchor output\" is only deployed by lnd so far and the last version (`option_zero_htlc_tx_fee`) isn't yet finalized. I've not look in-depth on their anchored transaction broadcast strategy though avoiding to introduce yet-another-vector of transaction-relay jamming that's something I've in mind for the LDK implementation.\r\n\r\n> Unless you are worried about a rogue Lightning implementation not following a future Lightning spec and creating a multiple parent, 1 child package when it shouldn't?\r\n\r\nNote, the BOLTs loosely specify the safe propagation of LN time-sensitive transactions. It's left to the knowledge of implementors for the best part (dust threshold, standard script flags, min tx size, ...) What I'm worried of is uninformed Lightning or L2 developers extending even further than today the scope of assumptions on mempool/p2p Core's behavior with safety implications for their protocols. Especially when it's a behavior potentially frail that we might heavily revise in the future such as handling of DoSy transactions.\r\n\r\nAgain, with the lack of a clear project philosophy on the valid set of assumptions one can make on the stability of what Core offers at the mempool/p2p level, I'm learning the lesson, better to be conservative as an upper layer dev!\r\n",

That feels like a very reasonable use of (N parents - 1 child) that has no drawbacks whatsoever.",

If\n+     transactions in a package are all related, exceeding this limit would mean that the package\n+     can either be split up or it wouldn't pass individual mempool policy.\n+\n+   - Note that, if these mempool limits change, package limits should be reconsidered. Users may\n+     also configure their mempool limits differently.\n+\n+* Packages must be topologically sorted. (#20833)\n+\n+* Packages cannot have conflicting transactions, i.e. no two transactions in a package can spend\n+   the same inputs. Packages cannot have duplicate transactions. (#20833)\n+\n+* No transaction in a package can conflict with a mempool transaction. BIP125 Replace By Fee is\n+  disabled for packages. (#20833)\n+\n+   - RBF in packages may be enabled in the future.",
