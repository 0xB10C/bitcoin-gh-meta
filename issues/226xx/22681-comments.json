But for the 22.0rc2 manpage update, it was done on the 22.0rc2 tagged commit rather than prior to it. If I run `contrib/devtools/gen-manpages.sh` on the current head of 22.x (which is not tagged), then the manpages have the expected version.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should update the script to deal with this case, but I wouldn't say that this is an issue that needs to be solved for 22.0.",
