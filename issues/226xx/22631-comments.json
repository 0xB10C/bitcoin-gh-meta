It is necessary to *run* Qt5 software with a wayland backend, but the build itself is (as far as I know) Qt backend independent. \r\n\r\n(This is the case for builds against the system libraries because distributions ship Qt5 as a shared library, and [the package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/hirsute/amd64/qtwayland5/filelist) contains a set of shared libraries loaded at run time)",
