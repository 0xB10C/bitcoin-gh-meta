I would like that Bitcoind should be so conservative that features work on a plain vanilla current distribution release like Debian, without needing to add foreign package repositories.\r\n* I see many log lines `Error connecting to xxx.b32.i2p:0: Unexpected reply to \"NAMING LOOKUP NAME=xxx.b32.i2p\": \"NAMING REPLY RESULT=INVALID_KEY NAME=xxx.b32.i2p\"`\r\n* I do not like that it seems that for i2pd it is needed to allow outbound TCP+UDP to all ports, I would like defined ports or at least a defined smaller port range for a more defined situation.\r\n* Great performance boost on bitcoin-qt startup, really lightning fast now :+1: \r\n\r\nAddition:\r\nIf adding `onion=0` to the bitcoin.conf shown in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22634#issuecomment-893825960 I get the strange user experience, that there are now zero I2P connections anymore even after 3 hours running, allthough `bitcoin-cli -addrinfo` shows `\"i2p\": 10,` which is 2 more than the 8 added with addnode in bitcoin.conf. There are only 3 inbound Onion connections. Wonder why disabling Onion outbound would have an effect on I2P. Edit: On a second test, after having bitcoind run with both Onion and I2P connections for 1h or so, after restart with onion=0, so only I2P network, I got I2P connections right on startup, so works for me now. But nevertheless, I leave the first experience written here, for doc.\r\nI could now also remove the I2P addnode lines from bitcoin.conf, and get I2P connections after restart, I guess the I2P peers are used now from the peer cache.",

The latest i2pd release is 2.38, and 2.36 is shipped with Debian testing / bullseye. Edit: The issue with i2pd 2.23 was addressed on our side. I have been retesting i2pd 2.23 and after some initial funkiness (spurious warnings about peers before sometimes finally succeeding the connection) it has been working fairly well, though 2.36 and up seem more solid.\r\n- Regarding seeing outbound onion connections with onlynet=i2p, I was able to reproduce #22647. Configuring with `-onion=0` or #22651 solves it.\r\n\r\nI'll look at updating `doc/i2p.md`.",

      "body" : "@achow101 I have now rewritten my download&verfiy bash script already. It's true that I e.g. do not download into a subfolder \"x86_64-linux-gnu\", so as you said, I experienced that `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing` does not work. My workaround was just to do `grep <Tarballname> SHA256SUMS` and then `sha256sum <Tarballname>` to be able to do manual visual comparison of the two output hashes (which I did also with the previous SHA256SUM format file, which contained the signature itself). I am not sure if this is good or bad, on one hand I like it that the SHA256SUMS file mirrors the download directory structure, that is clean and I think it would not be feasible to have an SHA256SUMS file in every arch sub dir, because that would require also a signature file for each of them. On the other hand, I agree, that normally one does not download in an arch sub dir. But the latter could be done easily I think, though.",

      "body" : "I've been running `bitcoind` with `i2pd` since shortly after it was added to `master`. I also have `tor` enabled, but clearnet is blocked. Initially I only had 2-3 I2P peers, but by now I sometimes see the number of I2P peers exceed the Tor peers. In an average week, I already push out more traffic over I2P than over Tor. Awesome addition to Bitcoin, having a great experience with it so far! \r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed is that when the node temporarily loses Internet connectivity and gets disconnected from its peers, Tor is much faster to reconnect once Internet is back. Not sure why that is.\r\n\r\nA few comments on what others have said:\r\n\r\n> Singular specification of parameter onlynet with value i2p should only allow I2P connections outbound, not Onion.\r\n\r\nI think the name `onlynet` is not intuitive. Why would I add _two_ lines named `**only**net` to allow **two** transports/protocols?\r\n\r\n> * `/var/log/i2pd/i2pd.log` shows many errors `error - Identity: Unknown crypto key type 4` which according to [this issue](https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/issues/1676) is because of too old i2pd version 2.23.0. I would like that Bitcoind should be so conservative that features work on a plain vanilla current distribution release like Debian, without needing to add foreign package repositories.\r\n\r\nI created the referenced issue (I found this thread via the backlink ð¯ ). Just one comment here, the warning message did not impact functionality in any visible way, and I'm not even sure if they went away after the upgrade or if they've just been replaced with other ones. I still get a bunch of errors and warnings, see a selection below. I assume it's just `i2pd` being a bit too verbose.\r\n\r\nHere are my top errors (please note that I use `i2pd` for non-bitcoind stuff as well): https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/issues/1685\r\n\r\n> * I see many log lines `Error connecting to xxx.b32.i2p:0: Unexpected reply to \"NAMING LOOKUP NAME=xxx.b32.i2p\": \"NAMING REPLY RESULT=INVALID_KEY NAME=xxx.b32.i2p\"`\r\n\r\nI only have around 2 of those per week in my logs. Think it's just some harmless & intermittent failure.\r\n\r\n> * I do not like that it seems that for i2pd it is needed to allow outbound TCP+UDP to all ports, I would like defined ports or at least a defined smaller port range for a more defined situation.\r\n\r\nI don't know much about `i2pd`, but I think this is implied by the fact that it's a P2P network and node operators are encouraged to choose their own custom listening ports (I guess for censorship resistance?).\r\n\r\nBy the way, none of the ports need to be reachable from the outside for `i2pd` to work. It's good for the network, but fully optional.\r\n",

This happened for me just now on a few tests when using `test_runner.py`. You may want to try specifying `test_runner.py -j1` (the default is `-j4`). I didn't do that myself; I just used the default (jobs 4), and had a few timeout failures.\r\n\r\nAnd as @hebasto asked, are the results reproducible?

I found my old 1GB raspi with 500GB and very old internal HDD, and thought it would be nice to see how 0.22 works on low end devices.\r\n\r\nRunning Both Mainnet and Signet on it (uptime ~ 42 Hrs) and everything is going smooth as butter. CPU usage consistently less than 30%, core temp stable around 40 degrees.\r\n\r\nNode is reachable via onion and i2p, other testers, feel free to connect\r\n\r\nMainnet: \r\n - o2dpmr4xc75aj72akuzufjri4wrw6jr5y6w2yskgzp4oaog4pq362cid.onion\r\n - lqj5kwcups2ntq6wawt6khwf5gnzwxtlhigtvqc6mwflf3g6wiqq.b32.i2p\r\n\r\nSignet: (serving COMPACT_FILTERS)\r\n - kvf3fu7hmflcubytcoukskbf6lcc2hfd3fxsjptpb2jaqji77uv5kkyd.onion\r\n - t3aglgijcim27ga54iiiptl56bn36tgjmodpiftrgfluwff5b3ja.b32.i2p\r\n\r\n### System and Setup\r\n- Desktop: x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux-Ubuntu, 16GB Ram, 12 Core, 2.9GHz\r\n- Raspi3: armv7l GNU/Linux-raspibolt, 1 GB Ram, 4 Core, 1.2 GHz\r\n\r\nUsed the desktop to sync blockdata from last year October. It took just around 2 hours.\r\n\r\n### Tor Test\r\n- Verified that Tor V2 peers are only connected at the time of IBD. They aren't visible in `-netinfo` but are reported in `getpeerinfo` and `getconnectioncount`. \r\n- Verified that no Tor V2 peer is connected after IBD. `addnode/connect` also doesn't work. \r\n- Tor seemed much faster in IBD block downloads than I2P.\r\n\r\nI couldn't see an `asmap` column as mentioned by `-netifno --help` even though I have `asmap` config enabled. I can see asmap files created in datadir. Probably I am missing something.\r\n\r\n### I2P Test\r\n- I2P only IBD seemed very slow.\r\n- After IBD, both nodes successfully found other i2p peers. \r\n\r\n### Wallet Test\r\nUsed an empty coldcard to send/recv signet coins, with both QT and SpecterDesktop connected to the node. Everything went smoothly.\r\n\r\nAddress verification is not properly working with coldcard. I am generating `tb1...` addresses but the device is showing `bc1...`. Probably it's something on the coldcard side, not core.   \r\n\r\n### Guix Build\r\n```\r\n$ find ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output -type f -print0 | env LC_ALL=C sort -z | xargs -r0 sha256sum\r\n3885d6b383207bc78a647d07f207486c830db6775ecbe4360ba1ac62bb69933c  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/aarch64-linux-gnu/SHA256SUMS.part\r\ndeeebf1737cbfd9c7ce01a6a5e10d24550c998c5bef3c6f905e0edd8c3e41794  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/aarch64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc3-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\na0688cc70dfe2f2d0667b8598083834add6cfae794bf379a9a5fd16e91d81261  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/aarch64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc3-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\nfe6e9d5a612ecb480c047662b98def364d77f5beafbab5a609e4ce3cf8c3f6a0  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/arm-linux-gnueabihf/SHA256SUMS.part\r\n569d759701c0b2eb70fa76a332f18f293d25c939aeb937d7e8e1971d5ebcb8a3  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/arm-linux-gnueabihf/bitcoin-22.0rc3-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n3033954d202defe2e6d99df27df23dbce509d0e57a7d754a50e1b225fd855f94  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/arm-linux-gnueabihf/bitcoin-22.0rc3-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\n558fcd9fff29076b5b8124130ef3a864f554f58a3bf91cd000a6a016437bd84b  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/dist-archive/bitcoin-22.0rc3.tar.gz\r\n1380dd3e1465f4f441ebf52e82e7cf3c1e17963607281995bc027fdd115b7c86  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/powerpc64-linux-gnu/SHA256SUMS.part\r\n9c0dd89861d03d46a9db57eb7ffd9adcd7e0d9d5902d8d4647558f59e25e8594  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/powerpc64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc3-powerpc64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n1ff536aa97887ce06ac8d0807d94efb2be6dfeb30959a29f3233a42e2a3b32ef  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/powerpc64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc3-powerpc64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n7d474cfad9682f7f3156cf1b59beb3faade09db101a5dd7d256db82769df3298  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/riscv64-linux-gnu/SHA256SUMS.part\r\ne751d50585bad9d284842319090330d63393eb02704680c06f62f760b81611f6  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/riscv64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc3-riscv64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n294647418c277bb1cd04b2879be5636d64f4d64a91596cfb5da9ada64d76ac9d  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/riscv64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc3-riscv64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n5622a76ec07ff05dc488aa9fe927a5a34b268793bd7f0ed48ca964efaabccbe0  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/x86_64-linux-gnu/SHA256SUMS.part\r\nc09e564f42de31221338aaaa64f7c4015b6799d1ad4011e5088ef81fca01b9cd  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/x86_64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc3-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n8776c40a6bcd67bd4baa90e44934c1c59380a02b970e647790abf3875e8fbdcd  ./guix-build-22.0rc3/output/x86_64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc3-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\n ",
