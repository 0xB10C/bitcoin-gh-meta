I would like that Bitcoind should be so conservative that features work on a plain vanilla current distribution release like Debian, without needing to add foreign package repositories.\r\n* I see many log lines `Error connecting to xxx.b32.i2p:0: Unexpected reply to \"NAMING LOOKUP NAME=xxx.b32.i2p\": \"NAMING REPLY RESULT=INVALID_KEY NAME=xxx.b32.i2p\"`\r\n* I do not like that it seems that for i2pd it is needed to allow outbound TCP+UDP to all ports, I would like defined ports or at least a defined smaller port range for a more defined situation.\r\n* Great performance boost on bitcoin-qt startup, really lightning fast now :+1: \r\n\r\nAddition:\r\nIf adding `onion=0` to the bitcoin.conf shown in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22634#issuecomment-893825960 I get the strange user experience, that there are now zero I2P connections anymore even after 3 hours running, allthough `bitcoin-cli -addrinfo` shows `\"i2p\": 10,` which is 2 more than the 8 added with addnode in bitcoin.conf. There are only 3 inbound Onion connections. Wonder why disabling Onion outbound would have an effect on I2P. Edit: On a second test, after having bitcoind run with both Onion and I2P connections for 1h or so, after restart with onion=0, so only I2P network, I got I2P connections right on startup, so works for me now. But nevertheless, I leave the first experience written here, for doc.\r\nI could now also remove the I2P addnode lines from bitcoin.conf, and get I2P connections after restart, I guess the I2P peers are used now from the peer cache.",

The latest i2pd release is 2.38, and 2.36 is shipped with Debian testing / bullseye. Edit: The issue with i2pd 2.23 was addressed on our side. I have been retesting i2pd 2.23 and after some initial funkiness (spurious warnings about peers before sometimes finally succeeding the connection) it has been working fairly well, though 2.36 and up seem more solid.\r\n- Regarding seeing outbound onion connections with onlynet=i2p, I was able to reproduce #22647. Configuring with `-onion=0` or #22651 solves it.\r\n\r\nI'll look at updating `doc/i2p.md`.",

      "body" : "@achow101 I have now rewritten my download&verfiy bash script already. It's true that I e.g. do not download into a subfolder \"x86_64-linux-gnu\", so as you said, I experienced that `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing` does not work. My workaround was just to do `grep <Tarballname> SHA256SUMS` and then `sha256sum <Tarballname>` to be able to do manual visual comparison of the two output hashes (which I did also with the previous SHA256SUM format file, which contained the signature itself). I am not sure if this is good or bad, on one hand I like it that the SHA256SUMS file mirrors the download directory structure, that is clean and I think it would not be feasible to have an SHA256SUMS file in every arch sub dir, because that would require also a signature file for each of them. On the other hand, I agree, that normally one does not download in an arch sub dir. But the latter could be done easily I think, though.",
