One potential issue could be that depends build logs become a bit less usable, if they end up being a mashup of overlapping build jobs, rather than packages being built sequentially?\r\n\r\nAre there more benefits / depends improvements you have in mind, other than just faster builds, which are dependent on this change? I think the fact that we currently have (slower) sequential builds is somewhat offset by heavy caching, and that packages are updated infrequently. A builder is going to see the most benefit from parallelism when doing an initial build (and download) from scratch.\r\n\r\n",
