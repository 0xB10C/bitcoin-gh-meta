Being able to build with a system univalue library really doesn't provide any benefit to users, but results in issues like #22412 which suck up reviewer and maintainer time. Maintaining support for different versions of univalue also expands the matrix of different build/configuration combinations which we really should (but don't) test if we claim support.",

      "body" : "I know that the forking process already began before this PR, and I think that forking in open source can be very good. But I also think that when you fork, it is better practically and ethically to _rename the fork_. In the case of a library, this doesn't need to involve renaming functions and classes in the library, but the forked library should at least have different library filenames (`libunivalue.a`) and include filenames (in this case just `univalue.h`) so it is not a nightmare if downstream projects have code requiring both libraries as dependencies. Also it would be good to rename the source directory [`src/univalue/`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src/univalue) and update the readme documentation [`src/univalue/README.md`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/univalue/README.md) to explicity say the library has been forked, the forks are incompatible, problems and discussions about the fork should be directed at the new issue tracker / mailing list / irc channel / whatever, not at the original project.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that by renaming a directory and two files, you can make things less ambiguous, confusing, and potentially painful for downstream developers, while also being kinder to the author of the original library and letting the name he chose for his project refer unambiguously to his own project instead of a collection of forks.\r\n\r\nAs for what name to substitute, for an internal fork it could be nonsense like _xyzlkq_ for all it matters, or something like _unibtc_ to be coherent, or something ike _jsonvalue_ to be descriptive, or something like _univalue--_ to be cheeky, whatever.\r\n\r\nPlease ignore this suggestion if it's too cumbersome. Just wanted to describe a possible way to make forking less confusing and contentious.",
