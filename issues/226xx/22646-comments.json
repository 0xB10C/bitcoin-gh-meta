      "body" : "Strong concept ACK!\r\n\r\nAs well as the technical benefits listed in the PR description, a strong reason to go in this direction is to lower our maintenance and testing burden. Being able to build with a system univalue library really doesn't provide any benefit to users, but results in issues like #22412 which suck up reviewer and maintainer time. Maintaining support for different versions of univalue also expands the matrix of different build/configuration combinations which we really should (but don't) test if we claim support.",
