After some digging I believe this change correctly fixes a bug, though I think the problem is not in the unsigned integer overflow (which is well-defined), but in casting the resulting unsigned integer to a signed type (which I have recently learned is not defined behavior, when the unsigned value would be negative).\r\n\r\nSo I think this change, which casts to int64_t first before multiplying by -1, is exactly correct.",
