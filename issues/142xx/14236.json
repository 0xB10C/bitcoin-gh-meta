Changed Changed `get_deterministic_priv_key()` to return named tuple`(address, key)` \r\nI have tried to be exhaustive as possible in maximum coverage for non-wallet mode without affecting any coverage for wallet mode.   \r\n\r\nHowever, I could not check the tests in wallet mode because of timeout issues. Hopefully, travis job checks those.\r\n\r\nTests `feature_block.py`, `feature_logging.py` and `feature_reindex.py` were skipping despite having no direct dependency on any wallet functions. So, I have also disabled the `skip_test_no_wallet()` for those files too.",
