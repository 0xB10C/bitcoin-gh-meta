Having them in-tree would make reviewing them easier. Generally I think it is a good idea to minimize the exposure surface to each third-party dependency by limiting the use of more general utility functions that happens to be provided by the dependency (such as `evhttp_uriencode` and `evhttp_uridecode` in `libevent`).",
