At startup, it is loaded after loading/reindexing/activation of blocks (in the background).\r\n\r\nIt only grabs a mempool lock while copying and sorting mempool shared pointers (similar to responding to a `mempool` BIP35 message), which takes 50-100ms here for 1 GB mempool. Loading from disk seems to take up to dozens of seconds but happens in the background.\r\n",
