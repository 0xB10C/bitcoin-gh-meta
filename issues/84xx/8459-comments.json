Although it is true in this version you could achieve the same effect using `blockmaxsize`, you'll be doing extra computation for no reason.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I think its most important to provide explanation about what the functionality and command line option changes are and the prior version does a better job at that than this.\r\n  ",
