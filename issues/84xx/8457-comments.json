In this case blocks are usually referenced by height or hash.\r\n\r\nThere is also overloading in the protocol: `4\tlock_time\tuint32_t\tA time (Unix epoch time) or block number. See the locktime parsing rules`.\r\n\r\n> It seems messy, and we don't do that anywhere else on the API.\r\n\r\nFrom `help importaddress`: `1. \"script\"           (string, required) The hex-encoded script (or address) either`.\r\n\r\n> E.g. a long hash with no hexadecimal characters could be interpreted as a long number.\r\n\r\nUnlikely? Still it's simple to distinguish that block hash from a number.\r\n\r\n> Though even then I'm not convinced it's a worthwhile addition.\r\n\r\nFrom the API point of view, I think it's fair to fetch a block from it's height. From a technical point of view, making 2 calls causing locks on cs_main etc on a heavy loaded daemon is resource wasting.\r\n\r\nSo, +1 for `getblock hash|height (verbose)`.",
