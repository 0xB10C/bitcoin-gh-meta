Expiration now addresses that issue.\r\n\r\nWithout preserving the mempool node behavior changes drastically across restarts which complicates production use (e.g. mining overly small/low fee blocks) as well as development testing. The lack of retention also causes the loss of txn priority modifications made with prioritisetransaction which makes the API less reliable.",
