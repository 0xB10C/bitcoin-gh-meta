      "body" : "But I think we should really use clear terms here.\r\n* **\"Pruned Blockchain\"** is what we currently support in Bitcoin-Core with the `-prune` option.\r\n* **\"Pruned wallet\"** IMO is something that would remove old wallet transaction with the goal to increase the wallet load and displayer performance (currently not implemented in Bitcoin Core)\r\n\r\nThis feature request is under the term \"Pruned blockchain\". I think it would be possible to use an initial balance calculated through the UTXO set. Although I'm not sure if we want to support a such feature in Bitcoin-Core. Also the missing history could confuse users, it would lead to districting imported key during pruned blockchains, labeling them different on RPC as well as on the GUI level.",

If the user doesn't have a need for history, then a scan over the UTXO set suffices to get the balance correct for an imported/watch-only address. This is faster and works with a pruned block chain.\r\n\r\nAgree with @jonasschnelli on the clear use of terms. And please, don't all it a \"pruned wallet\", the word \"prune\" is already over-used in bitcoin-land (ultra-prune #1677, pruned blockchains, ....). And people, for fact, already call a blockchain-pruning Bitcoin Core instance a \"pruned wallet\". Let's find another name for limited-history wallets.\r\n\r\nBTW see also #5389.",
