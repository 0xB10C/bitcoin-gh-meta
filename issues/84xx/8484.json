   "body" : "This pull request helps to reduce debug logging and provides more granular control.\r\n\r\nSome \"net\" debugging moved to \"block\" for blocks and \"tx\" for transactions, making it easier to enable net debugging depending on the area being developed.\r\n\r\nFor the particularly numerous messages, additional debug messages are available at \"tx2\" and \"block2\".\r\n\r\nMost commmon \"mempool\" debugging moved to \"mempool2\", leaving the rarer messages still going to \"mempool\".\r\n\r\nThe more numerous \"estimatefee\" messages moved to \"estimatefee2\".\r\n\r\nReceived getdata block messages for recent blocks still goes to \"net\", but for older blocks to \"net2\" to make debugging block propagation easier.\r\n\r\nLines needed for incoming connections is reduced from 2 to 1 with clearer display of whether the connection in inbound or outbound.\r\n\r\nTime offset debugging where offsets are zero now goes to \"net2\", whereas unusual offsets still go to \"net\".\r\n\r\nThe overall result is that debugging can be enabled as is needed without seeing an overwhelming amount of debug as is currently the case when adding \"net\" debugging. To continue with the current \"net\" debug after this pull would then require adding \"net\", \"net2\", \"tx\", \"tx2\", \"block\", \"block2\".\r\n",
