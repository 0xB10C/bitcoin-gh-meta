   "body" : "This patch creates four threads for connecting to the P2P network on startup. This allows more attempts based on peers.dat before the timeout for connecting to two peers hits and the DNS seeds are queried for more peers. Once an initial quorum of outbound peers are connected, these extra threads end, and long term behaviour continues unchanged.\r\n\r\nFixes #15434 \r\n\r\nMarked as draft, looking for concept acks. Second patch just dumps some statistics on how successful connections are (successful = connection established, not a VERACK actually received). I get 20%-30% on initial startup; after running a while seems to be down to ~17%.",
