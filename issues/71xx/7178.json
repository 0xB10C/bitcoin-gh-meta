If priority block space is being phased out, then free transactions are going to have a much harder time getting into blocks (according to what I'm observing as well), so to prevent a bunch of un-mineable txs from piling up we should discourage limitfreerelay.\r\n\r\nAlso, it makes it easier for people to double-spend their zero-fee transactions, if those transactions weren't hanging around in a bunch of mempools because of high priority, yet not being able to be confirmed.\r\n",
