      "body" : "@NicolasDorier My approach and yours are not that different.  \r\n- You are storing the hash at which the calculation of the sequence lock time and height happened and using the fact that if that hash is still on the chain that the calculation must still be valid and the comparison to the current time and height must be valid because they can not have gone below what they were at the hash you saved.\r\n- I'm storing the lowest height hash at which the calculation of the sequence lock time and height would necessarily still be valid (which is the hash of the highest height input with a sequence lock, b/c if none of the inputs changed height then the calculation is trivially the same) and the result of the calculation.   But in the case of my code, I have to redo the comparison part because the current time and height maybe be lower than they were at the time I originally did the comparison.   So I will redo comparisons for every tx on every reorg, but that is extremely fast, and I save redoing the expensive calculations for many more txs.\r\n",

MaxInputHash would be equals to hash(B1).\r\n\r\nNow if B2 is found at height X+1, C1 still unconf, since B1 is still in the chain the LockPoint is not invalidated. My worry is that LockPoint SHOULD be invalidated as the prevHeights vector for calculating the LockPoint would not be the same anymore (the assumed height of C1 would be X+2 instead of X+1). \r\nThe value of nHeight/nTime in the LockPoint would be impacted by it.\r\nI am still not entirely clear if it would have a chance of corrupting the mempool with an invalid tx though. (which would give problem to GBT which now rely on a coherent mempool)",

I have the code written to do it, but it requires slight changes to the BIP 68 code and I didn't want to hold up merger for something of dubious value. But then I forgot to go back and clarify why the code here is safe.\r\n\r\nI've now added a commit with what is hopefully a detailed explanation.  And in the process I actually made it more efficient by eliminating the mempool input heights instead of capping them which will make recalculations on reorg even less frequent.\r\n",
