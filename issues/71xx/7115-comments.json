      "body" : "Reluctant ACK.\r\n\r\nCode ACK, agree about avoiding the circular dependency, and agree about avoiding GetArg calls to determine the mempool max size the whole time.\r\n\r\nI dislike moving more policy knowledge into the mempool itself (its size limit), though. It will complicate a more generic memory limiting approach, where there is not a single memory size limit, but one that depends on the UTXO size and perhaps other buffers. ",
