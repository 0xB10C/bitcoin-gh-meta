Even though the base system seems to have settled down a lot of experimentation is still happening at the edges, e.g. handling of fees, mempool policy, spam prevention, wallet security/reliability, privacy, scaling. Even the basic question \"is distributed consensus robust\" has not been answered decisively yet. It's far from a done deal. Also there are no guarantees, that is important to keep in mind. As a disclaimer I think it makes sense.\r\n",
