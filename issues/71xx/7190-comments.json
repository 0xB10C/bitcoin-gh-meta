I think this is better to only scan 10 and just recalculate locktime if it is more, rather than wasting time scanning to the genesis. I can change that though if you think it is indeed faster to scan to genesis. MempoolEntry older than 10 blocks are rather rare I would expect.\r\n\r\n>  In addition any transaction which entered your mempool more recently than the reorg depth will have to recalculated, so you will always have to recalculate at least the txs that came in since the last blcok.\r\n\r\nI don't understand your point.\r\nImagine tip = Block A, the tx1 comes in mempool. Then a reorg happens that replace BlockA with BlockB then tx1 will have, as expected, locktime invalidated.\r\nThis must be done, and can't be optimized, because the blockTime in LockTime(), MTP or not, will have changed.\r\n\r\nIf I understand your point : yes, during a reorg, all transaction which came since the last block will be invalidated, and they should be.",

I'm just saying you don't have to recalculate the time/height at which the sequence locks are valid which is the expensive part.\r\nWith your solution I think you will still be recalculating sequence locks for a significant fraction of the mempool on a reorg which is slow and destroys your utxo cache.\r\n",
