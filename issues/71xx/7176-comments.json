      "body" : "I've coded up an alternate idea (as @morcos mentioned in #6312) for making `removeForReorg` fast, which in turn also makes `CreateNewBlock` fast, even right after a reorg.  This approach is to cache the prevHeights for all inputs that are using a sequence lock, and whenever we have a reorg that disconnects a block that is older than the maximum height of a previous height, we redo the prevHeights calculation.  Otherwise we call `CheckLockTime` and instruct it to use the cached values of prevHeights.\r\n\r\nTo optimize this so that we don't needlessly recalculate prevHeights, I modified `LockTime` so that it will indicate to the caller which inputs are sequence-locked.  Only when a sequence-locked input height is above the height of a block disconnected in a reorg do we recalculate all the prevHeights.\r\n\r\nCode is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/compare/sequencenumbers...sdaftuar:6312-modifications\r\n\r\nI haven't tested it yet, I plan to do so as part of my testing of #6312.\r\n\r\n",

That approach is seen in #7184.  \r\nCreateNewBlock is untouched and remains fast in #7184, but reorgs require recalculating all sequence locks.  This can easily be changed by applying the additional commits from the refactorb branch above.\r\n\r\n",
