Of course I think we will find those, I send those myself, but that doesn't mean those users won't adapt.\r\n\r\nJust to summarize some of the reasons to deprecate priority:\r\n- code complexity: I think the computational complexity can be kept within reason at least for the existing functionality, but the code touches a lot of different places and it makes it more difficult to do perhaps more important work in those areas.\r\n- long term viability: If it's not incentive compatible, how long should we go about trying to put effort into supporting it.\r\n- it's currently broken: With mempool limiting not respecting priority its almost a useless concept anyway.  \r\n- we're not foreclosing on the possibility of some future notion of coin age: Perhaps we can regain most of the lost benefits of the existing priority metric with something like sipa's proposed coin age based fee delta.  Or even just a cleaner and more general way to implement a different metric that doesn't require so much core maintenance.",
