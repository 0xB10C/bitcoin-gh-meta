Do we really want number parsing and formatting in the GUI (this is oblivious to bitcoind) locale aware?\r\nImplementation wise it's a trivial change as Qt contains everything for locale-specific number processing. \r\n\r\nBut it may cause communication confusion between people or result in wrong amounts being sent if, for some reason, the locale is picked wrongly. This was the original reason for Satoshi to settle on one kind of number formatting. But maybe it's a misplaced concern now that we always ask for confirmation.\r\n",
