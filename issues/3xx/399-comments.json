If type-checking the value remains important this code:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n    int nMinDepth = 1;\r\n    if (params.size() > 3)\r\n        nMinDepth = params[3].get_int();\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould be replaced by this code:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n    if (params.size() > 3)\r\n        // unused parameter, used to be nMinDepth, keep type-checking it though\r\n        (void)params[3].get_int();\r\n```",
