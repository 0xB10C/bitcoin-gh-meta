Escrow requires communicating with another party.  The\nAPI allows for an external escrow UI to be implemented and sounds to me\nlike a better solution than hardcoding into the client.

Also an external implementation would require apis for importing/exporting transactions, and wouldn't e.g. have access to the wallet keys and address book. Seems ugly to me.\r\n\r\n The api/cli presented in this patch is nice (well, the redeem needs to also support sendmany redemptions).  Obviously a GUI for this would take a bit more workÃ¢ÂÂ and might reasonably wait until there are some examples of the functionality being used to inform the design.\r\n",

To increase visibility into the signature collection process, the latest commit adds the list of addresses that have signed the tx to the output of the RPC call.\r\n\r\nThe latest commit also refactors the script Solver function so it can be used to check more complex scripts that include repeated segments.  multisign now uses this facility to perform exact script matching.  This prevents an attacker from fooling the user into thinking a tx is protected when it is put fully under the control of the attacker by a maliciously crafted script.\r\n",
