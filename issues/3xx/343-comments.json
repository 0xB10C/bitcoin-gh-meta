So the attack scenario is:\r\n\r\nAttacker connects to your node (and they're not from -rpcallowip address).\r\nYou're running -ssl=1, so start ssl handshake to return 403 response.\r\nAttacker doesn't respond... your rpc process must wait -rpctimeout seconds before proceeding.\r\n\r\nJust dropping the connection immediately prevents the attack. Being \"a proper HTTP implementation\" is not high on the bitcoin wish list.\r\n",
