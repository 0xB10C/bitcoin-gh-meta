There's no reason to ignore someone setting `-nodatacarrier` to indicate they don't want OP_RETURN outputs in their mempool.\r\n\r\nLike I said, bare `OP_RETURN` outputs are *not* data carrying outputs. Treating them as such is misleading.\r\n\r\nSecond, if you are going to take that attitude, why do we even have the `-nodatacarrier` option? Setting  `-datacarriersize=0` will also prevent bare `OP_RETURN` outputs. Which actually suggests we should fix that redundancy if we want both options.\r\n\r\n@instagibbs Last time I checked a few months ago I could find examples of every single active mining pool mining data carrying OP_RETURN outputs. So yes, the `-nodatacarrier` option is likely entirely unused by ~100% of all hashing power. Secondly, since `-nodatacarrier` acts to censor transactions otherwise supported by ~100% of nodes, individual relay nodes setting it makes absolutely no difference to whether or not transactions reach miners. So I'm ok with just removing it.",

There is no reason for it to exist in the first place and it should just be removed. It is redundant with the `-datacarriersize` setting, because setting `-datacarriersize=0` is equivalent. Having two ways to achieve the same is just confusing and can lead to issues.\r\nAlso, unrelated to removing the option, the `std::optional<unsigned>` should just be flattened to `unsigned`, with `nullopt` being mapped to `0U`. Or, ideally along with removing the setting, `nullopt` is also removed in one go with no mapping required.",
