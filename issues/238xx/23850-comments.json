      "body" : "The difference between **suggesting to restrict scripts** and **asking the user to examine each script** before running:\r\n\r\nAlice might be able to identify if something is malicious however this attack or security recommendation was never meant for Alice. Bob cannot identify if something is malicious and runs few commands someone suggested to use with *notify config param to fix one of the issues. Bob thinks he is _doing the right thing_ but he is running a command which could end up in losing all his money.\r\n\r\n**How to avoid this?** _Don't examine each script._ Create some restrictions that blocks any suspicious commands, scripts, connections etc. Unfortunately we don't have any such feature in Bitcoin Core so users have to do it at system level.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n1. PowerShell has execution polices which can be used to restrict scripts: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2\r\n\r\n2. Macros can be used to run malicious scripts in Word documents. However we have settings to disable it (restriction). Attackers still try weird things using social engineering and many are successful.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/147384691-b5a4d76d-010a-4ce2-beb0-76d859a4941f.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/macro-security-for-microsoft-office",
