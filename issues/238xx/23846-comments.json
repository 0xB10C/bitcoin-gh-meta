I've just compiled `22.x` @ 56156a1f08b08127a0d7fc0abd4826f371382a98 on Arch Linux, which packages Boost [1.78.0-1](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/boost/), and that worked fine. Note that for `22.x` depends Boost would also available.\r\n\r\nSo what we need to decide is what to do for the period between now and when #20744 is merged, for anyone building master, using a system boost >= 1.78.0. Obviously they could also build against depends which is still version 1.77.0.",
