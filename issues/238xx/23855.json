   "body" : "There are 2 proposed fixups in discussions in #23280 which I have not implemented:\r\n\r\n1. An overhaul to return types and an option type for the two `*Chainstate` functions: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23280#issuecomment-984149564\r\n    - The change reintroduces stringy return types and is quite involved. It could be discussed in a separate PR.\r\n2. Passing in the unix time to `VerifyChainstate` instead of a callback to get the time: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23280#discussion_r765051533\r\n    - I'm not sure it matters much whether it's a callback or just the actual unix time. Also, I think `VerifyDB` can take quite a while, and I don't want to impose that the function have to \"run quickly\" in order to have it be correct.\r\n\r\nIf reviewers feel strongly about either of the two fixups listed above, please feel free to open a PR based on mine and I'll close this one!",
