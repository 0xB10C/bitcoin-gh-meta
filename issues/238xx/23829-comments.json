I think this is fine to do because:\r\n* C++11 braced init is safer, since it has more compile time checks\r\n* This patch has no conflicts as of now\r\n* `bitcoind` is not changed by this patch. I checked `clang++ -O2` and `g++ -O2` on my system.\r\n\r\nInstead of linking to a pull request for context, I think OP can be improved to give a clear motivation.
