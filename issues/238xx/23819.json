   "body" : "In the validation:block_connected tracepoint, we call block->GetHash(), which\r\nends up calling CBlockHeader::GetHash(), executing around 8000 serialization\r\ninstructions. We don't need to do this extra work, because block->GetHash() is\r\nalready called further up in the function. Let's save that value as a local\r\nvariable and re-use it in our tracepoint so there is no unnecessary tracepoint\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nShave off an extra 100 or so instructions from the validation:block_connected\r\ntracepoint by reusing a nearby GetTimeMicros(). This brings the tracepoint down\r\nto 54 instructions.  Still high, but much better than the previous ~154 and\r\n8000 instructions which it was originally.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: William Casarin <jb55@jb55.com>\r\n",
