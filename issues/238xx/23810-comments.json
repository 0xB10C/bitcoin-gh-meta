Only ~700 lines, which is not a huge PR as far as this repo is concerned. I could also break this out into multiple PRs, ex. (one for src/test/; one for src/crypto; one for src/wallet; etc) such that it is easier to review, and less breaking.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI have broken up the commit into a number of commits, one for reinterpret, one for const/const+reint, one for bracket init, and then a few for remaining static casts in various parts of the codebase. I think at least merging the reinterpret and const/const+reint commit is valuable.\r\n",
