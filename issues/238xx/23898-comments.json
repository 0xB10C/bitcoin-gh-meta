Ubuntu and Debian have their own `libdb-dev` and `libdb++-dev` packages, but these will install Berkeley DB 5.1 or later. This will break binary wallet compatibility with the distributed executables, which are based on BerkeleyDB 4.8. If you do not care about wallet compatibility, pass `--with-incompatible-bdb` to configure. Otherwise, you can build Berkeley DB yourself.\r\n\r\nAlso https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md#berkeley-db",
