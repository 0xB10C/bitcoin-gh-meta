This parameterizes hard coded values in the unit test that refer to the `Miner Confirmation Window`, which currently is `2016`.  This includes values not exactly 2016 but which were derived from it. Also changed `int` to `uint32_t` where appropriate to avoid compiler warnings. This makes one source of truth, and also helps people who might be adjusting this value in testing so the unit tests don't break.",
