   "body" : "Upgrade the ZeroMQ dependency from version 4.2.3 to the latest stable version 4.2.5.\r\n\r\nThis PR Follows the lead of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11986.\r\n\r\nI upgraded both patch files to correspond to the version `4.2.5` libzmq files.\r\nI assume doing so is still necessary and correct.\r\n\r\nWithout updating the patch line numbers, things appear to work, but you get extra log messages while building `depends` because things don't exactly match, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n/bitcoin/depends> make zeromq\r\nExtracting zeromq...\r\n/bitcoin/depends/sources/zeromq-4.2.5.tar.gz: OK\r\nPreprocessing zeromq...\r\npatching file src/windows.hpp\r\nHunk #1 succeeded at 58 (offset 3 lines).\r\npatching file src/thread.cpp\r\nHunk #1 succeeded at 307 with fuzz 2 (offset 87 lines).\r\nHunk #2 succeeded at 323 with fuzz 2 (offset 90 lines).\r\n```\r\nUpdating the patches seemed cleaner, so I did it. Note that libzmq had some whitespace changes, so that's why the updated patches do too.\r\n\r\nMore info: https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.2.5\r\n\r\ntags: libzmq, zmq, 0mq",
