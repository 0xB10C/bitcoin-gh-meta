But, when you do a transaction manually, you know the `maxfeerate` to expect when you call `sendrawtransaction`, not when you modify the config file of bitcoind.\r\n\r\nI think having a configurable default maxtxfee would be a good idea. Perhaps this function should then ignore the default if the user does `allowhighfees=true`.\r\n\r\n> (That said, I think this would be better in `signrawtransaction*` than `sendrawtransaction`)\r\n\r\nIt fits better here, because it already has the functionality needed in the `AcceptToMemoryPool` function via the absurd fee feature. In `sign`, you sometimes do not know the input amounts, which means the system sometimes can't check. Here, the amounts are always known because the mempool either knows or the tx is invalid.\r\n",
