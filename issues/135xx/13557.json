   "body" : "This Pull Request fully implements the [updated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/694) BIP 174 specification. It is based upon #13425 which implements the majority of the signing logic.\r\n\r\nBIP 174 specifies a binary transaction format which contains the information necessary for a signer to produce signatures for the transaction and holds the signatures for an input while the input does not have a complete set of signatures.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains structs for PSBT, serialization, and deserialzation code. Some changes to `SignatureData` have been made to support detection of UTXO type and storing public keys.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nMany RPCs have been added to handle PSBTs.\r\n\r\n`walletprocesspsbt` takes a PSBT format transaction, updates the PSBT with any inputs related to this wallet, signs, and finalizes the transaction. There is also an option to not sign and just update.\r\n\r\n`walletcreatefundedpsbt` creates a PSBT from user provided data in the same form as createrawtransaction. It also funds the transaction and takes an options argument in the same form as `fundrawtransaction`. The resulting PSBT is blank with no input or output data filled in. It is analogous to a combination of `createrawtransaction` and `fundrawtransaction`\r\n\r\n`decodepsbt` takes a PSBT and decodes it to JSON. It is analogous to `decoderawtransaction`\r\n\r\n`combinepsbt` takes multiple PSBTs for the same tx and combines them. It is analogous to `combinerawtransaction`\r\n\r\n`finalizepsbt` takes a PSBT and finalizes the inputs. If all inputs are final, it extracts the network serialized transaction and returns that instead of a PSBT unless instructed otherwise.\r\n\r\n`createpsbt` is like `createrawtransaction` but for PSBTs instead of raw transactions.\r\n\r\n`convertpsbt` takes a network serialized transaction and converts it into a psbt. The resulting psbt will lose all signature data and an explicit flag must be set to allow transactions with signature data to be converted.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis supersedes #12136",
