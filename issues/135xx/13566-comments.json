Otherwise the argument would be silently ignored.\r\n- Documentation seems to say default minconf is 1, while implementation uses 0 or 1.\r\n- Maybe could dedup caching code in `GetAvailableCredit` a little with something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nCAmount* cache = filter == ISMINE_SPENDABLE  ? nAvailableCreditCached : \r\n                 filter == ISMINE_WATCH_ONLY ? nAvailableWatchCreditCached :\r\n                 nullptr;\r\n```",
