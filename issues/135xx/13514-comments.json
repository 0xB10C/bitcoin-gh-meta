Shouldn't `LANG` be used only in the absence of other locale related environment variables?\r\n\r\n`locale(1)` from OS X:\r\n\r\n```\r\n     LANG         Used as a substitute for any unset LC_* variable.  If LANG is unset, \r\n                  it will act as if set to \"C\".  If any of LANG or LC_* are set to invalid\r\n                  values, locale acts as if they are all unset.\r\n\r\n     LC_ALL       Will override the setting of all other LC_* variables.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`locale(7)` from Linux:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       If the second argument to setlocale(3) is an empty string, \"\", for the default\r\n       locale, it is determined using the following steps:\r\n\r\n       1.
