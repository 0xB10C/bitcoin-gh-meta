   "body" : "Hi, I'm getting a FALSE as a result in ALL the Signature Verification test cases in \"script_tests.json\". Some tests related to the CHECKSIG or CHECKSMULTISIG pass because they are negative tests, but in all cases where some real signature is checked, the result is FALSE. Full disclosure: I'm running a different project in Java, and we are trying to implement all the test uses cases as they are described here in bitcoin-core.\r\nI don't think that the test cases are wrong themselves, but on the other hand the crypto lib from spongycastle doesn't lie...\r\nI'm sure I must be missing something, in case you ran across the same issue, any help is really appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",
