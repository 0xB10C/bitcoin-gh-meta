   "body" : "#13004 changed the default behavior for -printtoconsole but this has not been reflected in the command line help.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the description of -printtoconsole to reflect this change, and also provides the user with missing information on how to explicitly disable logging to debug.log.\r\n\r\nAt present I have made the latter update to two separate places (-printtoconsole and -debuglogfile) because a user looking for information on how to disable logging is probably going to look in the \"Debugging/Testing Options\" section. Moving -debuglogfile from the \"General\" options category to the \"Debugging/Testing\" section could potentially remove the need for this redundancy, but is probably out of the scope of this PR.",
