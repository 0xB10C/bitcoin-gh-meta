Last time we updated zeromq we were stung with a sneaky change that [broke gitian building](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11981), hence the need of the `sed` above.",

Since I did the looking to figure that out, I figured that I'd make this update. This is the only machine where I tested the depends build as well.\r\n\r\nFrom the 4.2.4 release notes, this one looked a little interesting. Although, I did NOT try to use it to make my node crash, so I don't know if it actually applies: \"ZMQ_PUB crash when due to high volume of subscribe and unsubscribe messages, an unmatched unsubscribe message is received in certain conditions\".",
