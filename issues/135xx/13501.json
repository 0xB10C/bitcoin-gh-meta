   "body" : "Fixes #11777. Replaces #13492.\r\n\r\nWhen calling RPC `stop`, there is a race when the event loop terminates before `HTTPRequest::WriteReply` and so the reply event fails to process. This happens because `event_base_dispatch` returns when there are no active or pending events, which is the case between `InterruptHTTPServer` and `HTTPRequest::WriteReply`.\r\n\r\nFix this by preventing premature event loop exit. This is accomplished by keeping a dummy (pending) event on the event base until all other events are removed and all workers are done.",
