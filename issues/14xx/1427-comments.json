However, a redundant line in debug won't hurt, just not worthy of a separate pull, IMO.\n\nPreviously (appeared at least in v0.6.0, fixed by now ) there is a duplicated timestamp output in main.cpp, on the recv message: \"timestamp timestamp received: ...\". That, I think, is a duplication worthy of fix, considering frequency of the recv message.\n\nIf we actually want a start time message, I think we should also provide a stop time message, so that users can parse the debug file and calculate the session time, when timestamp is not provided.",
