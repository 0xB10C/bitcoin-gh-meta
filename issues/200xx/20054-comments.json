That doesn't seem very useful though, so weak Concept ACK.",

If a miner is trying to activate the testdummy soft-fork, a warning will be shown to all users when the presumed soft-fork has activated. (Both before and after this patch). I understand that the 100-block warning will hit earlier than the vb-activated warning, but it shouldn't be the responsibility of the Bitcoin Core validation code to help debug miner software. A simple RPC python script (or even a hidden test-only RPC) should be less invasive and straightforward.",
