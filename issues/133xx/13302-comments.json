      "body" : "You are using `importprivkey` entirely incorrectly. `importprivkey` does not set an HD seed for keys to be derived from. Yet you are trying to import the private key that you use as the HD seed. `importprivkey` directly imports a private key to be used, no derivation happens with the key and the only transformation is to generate its address. Furthermore, `importprivkey` does not effect `getnewaddress` at all. You will not get imported private keys in `getnewaddress` and importing a private key does not change how new addresses are created.\r\n\r\nTo see the address that you want, you have to import its private key, not the private key of its parents. So you should have imported `btc_prv0`. You can then see that it imported successfully by using `getaddressesbyaccount` (or `getaddressesbylabel` if using the master branch).",
