I've attempted re-installing, restarting tor (`systemctl restart tor.service`), and restarting Bitcoin Core, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nI have the following in my `torrc` file:\r\n\r\n> HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/\r\n>HiddenServicePort 8333 127.0.0.1:8333\r\n\r\nAnd the following in bitcoin.conf:\r\n\r\n> onion=127.0.0.1:9050\r\n>listen=1\r\n>externalip=ONION_ADDR\r\n>discover=1\r\n\r\nONION_ADDR was found by `cat /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/hostname`\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you expect?:\r\nNot losing my connections, or regaining connections upon reinstall.\r\n\r\nHow reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so?:\r\nJust install Fedora 28, Bitcoin Core, and attempt to set up a Tor node.\r\n\r\nWhat version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)?:\r\nBitcoin 0.16.0 from BitcoinCore.org (verified!).\r\n",
