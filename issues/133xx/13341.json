If a message is not understood by translators (which are typically end-users, not developers) they'll either translate it literally, making it harder to understand instead of easier, with the added drawback of the user no longer being able to google it.\r\n\r\nAlso the translation was only working for bitcoin-qt as with the console programs, there is no translation backend. So it was injecting never-used translation messages for bitcoin-cli, -tx.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, stop translating options help completely. This should not affect the output **in any way** \\* except for bitcoin-qt when a non-English language is configured in the locale.\r\n\r\nThis implements #10962.\r\n\r\n\\*) I checked this, but please do verify this.",
