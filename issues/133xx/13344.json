I am not really sure if there are some limitations, I am overlooking the obvious or the documentation isn't accurate enough for fresh-on-systemd's like me (used to the good old init.d).\r\n\r\n- Bitcoin 0.16 (release, some cherry-picks) (compiled as root)\r\n- added user bitcoin `sudo adduser --system --group --no-create-home bitcoin`\r\n- created /etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf and chowned to user bitcoin \r\n- created /var/lib/bitcoind and chowned to user bitcoin\r\n- created /lib/systemd/system/bitcoin.service \r\n\r\nNow first of all, I got the binaries in /usr/local/bin/ -> that should be ok, all accessible,  just adjust bitcoin.service. \r\nNext one, it's complaining it can't do anything with `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true` -> still ok, comment out.\r\nThe real problem is that it seems to ignore the command line options. No -daemon, no -conf, no -pidfile seems in fact to be executed, just the plain bitcoind. Now I could create a home for bitcoin but the aim is to run multiple instances so that workaround is not an option.\r\n",
