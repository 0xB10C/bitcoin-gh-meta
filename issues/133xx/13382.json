It is obvious to us that it won't throw at run-time for `1970-01-01`, but that is not obvious for the compiler or static analyzers. From a static analyzer perspective it will look like these exceptions can reach all the way up to `NodeImpl::appInitMain()` where they are unhandled.\r\n* `boost::posix_time::from_time_t(0)` is simpler and doesn't throw. \r\n* Re-use the result of `boost::posix_time::from_time_t(0)` like we're doing in `DecodeDumpTime(Ã¢ÂÂ¦)`.\r\n* Mark `GetTimeMillis()` and `GetTimeMicros()` as `noexcept`.",
