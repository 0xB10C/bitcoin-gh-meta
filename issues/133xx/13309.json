   "body" : "Refactored `TransactionSignatureCreator` into a templated `GenericTransactionSignatureCreator` that works with both `CMutableTransaction` and `CTransaction`.\r\n\r\nThe advantage is that now in `SignSignature`, the `MutableTransactionSignatureCreator` can now operate directly with the `CMutableTransaction` without the need to copy the data into a `CTransaction`.\r\n\r\nRunning all unit tests brings a very noticable speedup on my machine:\r\n\r\n    48.4 sec before this change\r\n    36.4 sec with this change\r\n    --------\r\n    12.0 seconds saved\r\n\r\nrunning only `--run_test=transaction_tests/test_big_witness_transaction`:\r\n\r\n    16.7 sec before this change\r\n     5.9 sec with this change\r\n    --------\r\n    10.8 seconds saved\r\n\r\nThis relates to my first attempt with the const_cast hack #13202, and to the slow unit test issue #10026.\r\n\r\nAlso see #13050 which modifies the tests but not the production code (like this PR) to get a speedup.",
