All merges of code into the master branch are PGP signed by the maintainer who merges, which is automatically verified. The code itself is mirrorred by developers themselves, and we could easily add other mirrors too. Finally, release binaries are distributed using https://bitcoincore.org, and again use a well-audited system (gitian deterministic builds).\n\nWe mostly use GitHub for its ease of access and community, and not so much for actually managing or controlling or source tree. Unless that changes, I see no reason why the company running it should influence our choice.",
