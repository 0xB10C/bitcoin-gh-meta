What is the output of `systemctl status bitcoind` if the service is stoped and started?\r\n\r\n> added user bitcoin sudo adduser --system --group --no-create-home bitcoin\r\n\r\nThat could be one issue: The systemd file expects the bitcoin user to have a home directory, potentially at `/var/lib/bitcoin`. It depends on how your bitcoin.conf looks like. Could you show it to us?",

Except it doesn't know about the conf because it's not taking the correct conf. \r\n\r\nThe result of my research is, that the line\r\n\r\n`ExecStart=/usr/bin/bitcoind -daemon -conf=/etc/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf -pid=/run/bitcoind/bitcoind.pid`\r\n\r\ncan't ever work correctly because systemd will think the arguments are for systemd itself and for sure not passing them through to bitcoind. So it is just staring a plain bitcoind which is then looking for it's home dir in /hone/bitcoin/ but we didn't create one for our poor little process simply because we want it to use /var/lib/\r\n",
