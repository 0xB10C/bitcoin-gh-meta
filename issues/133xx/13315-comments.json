But the default of 1000 seems too low.\r\n\r\nIn older versions of ZMQ the default was \"no limit\" anyway. \r\n\r\nThe queue is per SUBscriber, so if you have thousands of listeners to the node you might see some increase in memory usage.  I was not able to see an increase in memory usage on my system with 6 subscribers on different computers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the setting is not for a limit in MB , that would have made it easier to configure. \r\nevery value now seems somewhat arbitrary, and it highly depends on how many subscribers are connected \r\n-edit- I did some more testing and these peaks are about 3000messages and 3MB in size and happen when a block is found (or synced). So, in worst case scenario of a totally failing router or nic on your network the queue would grow at about 3MB per block. \r\nSo if I want to limit memory usage to 500B, the SNDHWM value should be 500000 / number of subscribers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

In normal situations there never is a queue; the queue grows only when bitcoind pushes the messages faster then your network can handle (note: 'network', not client software - the receiving zmq-socket has its own buffer).   \r\n\r\n\r\n",

(The remote end can detect this when sequence numbers get skipped.) \r\n\r\nThis was originally chosen by design to be left at the default in order to be *conservative*--enabling ZMQ notifications and connecting a client should *not* have any potential adverse impact on bitcoind operation.\r\n\r\nI think allowing this behavior to be tuned via a command line or config file option, to set the numerical value of the high water mark, including turning it off, would be very useful for people relying on this interface. Unfortunately, it is a per-socket behavior and not per-notification, but that's the best that can be done.",
