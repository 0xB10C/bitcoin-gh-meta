   "body" : "ZMQ has a default limit of 1000 buffered messages. When it hits the limit messages are dropped. This happens sometimes when a new block is found and ~2500messages are send (almost) at once.  \r\n50-800 usually got lost on my (cheap) node. \r\n [ZMQ_SNDHWM](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/blob/master/doc/zmq_setsockopt.txt#L840) \r\n\r\nThe PUBlisher limit,  SNDHWM, is disabled by setting it to 0.\r\nOn very slow networks it might fill up memory a bit, but that is hardly noticeable. \r\n \r\nSame applies to the SUBscriber, so it would be good practice to set RCVHWM to zero as well, although I was unable to hit the limit on the subscriber side anyway.\r\n\r\nI've tested for about a day and had a bunch of subscribers running on different computers, and not a single message got dropped. ( also while using swap and 100% cpu  `stress --vm-bytes $(awk '/MemAvailable/{printf \"%d\\n\", $2 * 1.9;}' < /proc/meminfo)k --vm-keep -m 1 -c 1 -i 2` )\r\nI forced one subscriber to lag about 10000 messages , and they were still not dropped. \r\n\r\nsubscriber testscript:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/FeedTheWeb/e6243410cb463759d5b29fae24550f36  \r\n ",
