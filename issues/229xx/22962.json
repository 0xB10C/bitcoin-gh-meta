   "body" : "CFeeRate serialization has several issues:\r\n\r\n* It is confusing, because feerates can be in BTC/kvB, sat/vB, ... making any serialization ambigious. If there was future code using the serialize method, it would be better off using a serialization method that mentions the unit.\r\n* It is unused, only used in fuzzing. The useless fuzz test will consume CPU time of the other fuzz targets and make fuzzing less effective overall.\r\n\r\nFix both by removing the methods.",
