   "body" : "I've been doing a lot of work recently in the data/*.json test vectors and have noticed that the format of the tests (both the jsons themselves and how they are processed) is a bit brittle and clumsy. It might be worthwhile -- although a mild inconvenience to downstream consumers who depend on the specific format -- to convert the format from arrays to objects with key/value mappings instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtending the test vectors ends up being a bit of a chore, especially if the number of optional arguments grows and you need to insert a default value. It's also somewhat bizzare that transactions are defined as hex txs, it might make more sense to list the transactions as native JSONs (if a bit more verbose) as hex strings make the format harder to read. Going for JSON encoded transactions would make it easier to see what a specific test is doing, and would permit nicer auto-formatting of test vectors. There are also other test areas I noticed are missing, such as lockpoint declarations for used TXIDs, which could be beneficial for testing nSequence/nLockTime in transactions as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't think it's particularly high priority, but perhaps someone has an interest in working on this!",
