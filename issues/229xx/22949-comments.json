Paying one satoshi more or less doesn't even matter at all since a satoshi is basically worthless. \r\n\r\n> It is unlikely that a user can trigger this as it requires a very specific set of rounding errors to occur as well as the transaction not needing any change and being right on the lower bound of the exact match window. However I was able to trigger the assertion while running coin selection simulations, albeit after thousands of transactions and with some weird feerates.\r\n\r\nThis pr shouldn't be merged. Even op acknowledged that the end user is unlikely to face any issue like he did in his simulations.\r\n",
