      "body" : "> Is adding an alias compliant with the specs?\r\n\r\nIf this question is about following BIP, then I think yes it's implemented according to BIP 14.\r\n\r\nThere is a config option to add comments in User Agent string: [`uacomment`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/896649996bdaa80300fa20027a9789558233268d/src/init.cpp#L520)\r\n\r\nAccording to this comment, fancy characters are removed from it: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15048#issuecomment-450345595 \r\n\r\nPracticalswift had opened an issue to simplify UA string in which different parts of this string are shared: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21492#issuecomment-804174208\r\n\r\nI agree with Marcofalke's comment here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21492#issuecomment-804657428\r\n\r\n> Given there are also other ways to personalize a node (e.g., by generating a vanity Tor / I2P address), I'm wondering if changing the version string is safe to do?\r\n\r\nSuch things affect privacy. For example if 3 people in this GitHub issue share their custom UA strings or vanity onion/i2p address:\r\n\r\n1. Your privacy: everyone knows which node are you using and can spy on you. In some cases even link your different addresses if listening on multiple networks: https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2021-09-01.html\r\n2. Others privacy: if I have 8 outbound connections, 2 are using UA strings shared in this issue, I can focus on other 6 for collecting information if I am not interested in spying on you. If UA strings were same or nothing extra added, I would have to assume all 8 are unknown users, collect, analyze more information.\r\n\r\nNot sure about question 2 and 3. My guess is your node can connect to any version. Removing UA string completely might still affect few things.\r\n",
