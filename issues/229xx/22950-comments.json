The check treated `file_name.h` and `file_name.cpp` as the same module, so the import pattern here of `addrman.h` <- `addrman_impl.h` <- `addrman.cpp` was perceived as a circular dependency. I fixed this by telling it to also treat `file_name_impl.h` as part of the same module. ",

      "body" : "Concept ACK. I'm a big fan of compilation firewall patterns. From Herb Sutter:\r\n\r\n> One big advantage of this idiom is that it breaks compile-time dependencies. First, system builds run faster because using a Pimpl can eliminate extra #includes. I have worked on projects where converting just a few widely-visible classes to use Pimpls has halved the systemâs build time. Second, it localizes the build impact of code changes because the parts of a class that reside in the Pimpl can be freely changed â that is, members can be freely added or removed â without recompiling client code. Because itâs so good at eliminating compilation cascades due to changes in only the now-hidden members, itâs often dubbed a âcompilation firewall.â\r\n\r\n(https://herbsutter.com/gotw/_100/)\r\n\r\nBoth are relevant here. addrman.h is eventually included by just about everything, so minimizing its compilation time is potentially a big win. There's also a plan to rework its implementation. If we first make addrman into a pimpl, that could theoretically be done without any impact on the rest of the codebase.",
