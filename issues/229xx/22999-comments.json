(Note though that I'm not a heavy users of the benchmarks in general, maybe there is a need for silencing that I'm not aware of).",

The -quiet arg was actually my first motivation, to be able to less painfully compare results or share them, most of which for me have the verbose >5% err unstable warnings even when all the recommendations are followed, and it takes an annoying amount of time to edit out all the warnings by hand. People can see the %err, so for sharing results the noisy warnings are quite pollutive and it's so handy to be able to silence them.",
