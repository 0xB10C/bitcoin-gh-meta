One person's tACK may mean \"I built it and ran the unit tests\"; another person's may include playing around with RPCs/GUI in testnet and trying to break it. Those are such wildly different scenarios that if we want it, the documentation should clearly explain what it means. But I fear that today people are already using them with very different meaning, so codifying it may just add more confusion.\r\n\r\nAlso: code-review ACK, does that imply a concept ACK or not?",
