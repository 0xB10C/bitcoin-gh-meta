   "body" : "This PR aims to further increase MiniWallet usage in the functional test feature_rbf.py by using it in the `make_utxo(...)` helper, which is the only part that needs a wallet for most sub-tests. In order to do that, the amounts for the utxos have to be scaled down in two sub-tests first (`test_doublespend_chain` and `test_doublespend_tree`, see first two commits), since we need amounts passed to `make_utxo` than can be funded by only one input. For creating UTXOs with a value of 50 BTC, we'd need to implement a method for consolidating multiple utxos into one first, which seems to be overkill.\r\n\r\nNote that after this PR's change, there is only one sub-test left (`test_rpc`) that needs the wallet compiled into bitcoind.",
