   "body" : "The functions `ReadOrderPos` and `WriteOrderPos` have been introduced in commit 9c7722b7c5ce49130bd978b932f73b629ce5cebe in 2012. Since accounts have been removed in #13825 (commit c9c32e6b844fc79467b7e24c6c916142a0d08484), they are only called at one place in `CWalletTx::{Serialize,Unserialize}` and thus can be directly inlined instead. Additionally, this PR aims to avoids duplicate lookups on the map `mapValue` (affects keys \"n\" and \"timesmart\").",
