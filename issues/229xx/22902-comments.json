Some earlier review is in https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/pull/1.\r\n\r\nI suspect hooking into the `add` and `spend` tracepoints during IBD could have a noticeable performance impact. I'll test this. If is is the case, then it should be documented. Not hooking into the tracepoints shouldn't have any performance impact.\r\n",
