   "body" : "Work starter to remove Chain::Lock interface by adding m_last_block_processed_height in CWallet and m_block_height in CMerkleTx to avoid GetDepthInMainChain having to keep a lock . Once this one done, it should ease work to wipe out more cs_main locks from wallet code.\r\n\r\nI think it's ready for a first round of review before to get further.\r\n\r\n- `BlockUntilSyncedToCurrent` : restrain isPotentialTip to isTip because we want to be sure that wallet see BlockDisconnected callbacks if its height differs from the Chain one. Actually, GetDepthInMainChain query directly chain height so it always has the right one but asynchronicity breaks this assumption. \r\n\r\n- `AbandonTransaction` : in case of conflicted tx (nIndex = -1), we set its m_block_height to the one of conflicting blocks, but if this height is superior to CWallet::m_last_block_processed_height, that means tx isn't conflicted anymore so we return 0 as tx is again unconfirmed\r\n\r\n- `AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe`: in case of block disconnected, transactions are added to mempool again, so we need to replace old txn in `mapWallet` with a height set to zero so we remove check on block_hash.IsNull  ",
