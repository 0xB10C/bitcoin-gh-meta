      "body" : "@jonatack this happens after running invalidateblock and generating a replacement block at in same second and with the same coinbase address, the resulting block has the same hash as the invalidated block which then generates the \"AcceptBlock FAILED (duplicate (code 0))\" error reported above.\r\n\r\nFor our project (@dexX7 ) we run some bespoke tests that generate blocks, invalidates the chain then generates replacement blocks. This issue only arose after moving from the generate RPC call to generatetoaddress using the same address each time.\r\n\r\nDue to needing to generate replacement blocks in the same second it does not show up in manual tests, if you script it on regtest then this is more likely to show up. After our script failed I did manually recreate the problem by hard coding the block time in CreateNewBlock and skipping its call to UpdateTime.\r\n\r\nYou can see the same blockhash being generated here with block time fixed and the same coinbase address being used. Note that the client being run is based on Bitcoin 0.18.\r\n\r\n    user@disco:/mnt/development/github/omnicore-original/src$ ./omnicore-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 1  moneyqMan7uh8FqdCA2BV5yZ8qVrc9ikLP\r\n    [\r\n      \"1fbfceb118b6303dc3329d912524331fc49d7e92a87996151058ad73f48ccf22\"\r\n    ]\r\n    user@disco:/mnt/development/github/omnicore-original/src$ ./omnicore-cli -regtest stop\r\n    Omni Core server stopping\r\n    user@disco:/mnt/development/github/omnicore-original/src$ rm -Rf ~/.bitcoin\r\n    user@disco:/mnt/development/github/omnicore-original/src$ ./omnicored -regtest -daemon\r\n    Omni Core server starting\r\n    user@disco:/mnt/development/github/omnicore-original/src$ ./omnicore-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 1 moneyqMan7uh8FqdCA2BV5yZ8qVrc9ikLP\r\n    [\r\n      \"1fbfceb118b6303dc3329d912524331fc49d7e92a87996151058ad73f48ccf22\"\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nRunning another manual test with the same set up and using invalidateblock.\r\n\r\n    user@disco:/mnt/development/github/omnicore-original/src$ ./omnicore-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 1 moneyqMan7uh8FqdCA2BV5yZ8qVrc9ikLP\r\n    [\r\n      \"1fbfceb118b6303dc3329d912524331fc49d7e92a87996151058ad73f48ccf22\"\r\n    ]\r\n    user@disco:/mnt/development/github/omnicore-original/src$ ./omnicore-cli -regtest invalidateblock 1fbfceb118b6303dc3329d912524331fc49d7e92a87996151058ad73f48ccf22\r\n    user@disco:/mnt/development/github/omnicore-original/src$ ./omnicore-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 1 moneyqMan7uh8FqdCA2BV5yZ8qVrc9ikLP\r\n    error code: -32603\r\n    error message:\r\n    ProcessNewBlock, block not accepted\r\n\r\nSolutions for this would be to make your script wait a second after running invalidateblock or using a different coinbase address.",
