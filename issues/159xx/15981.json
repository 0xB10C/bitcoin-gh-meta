   "body" : "Remove literal function names and print them using __func__. There are a few updated log messages in this commit that have been moved to a new function but still refer to their previous function, printing the function name with __func__ will resolve this in future. Using __func__ also removes logging code from grep results when searching on function name.\r\n\r\nA previous PR to change a single mislabelled log entry was added here.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15979\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the change from the previous one and adds every additional entry found by myself and practicalswift.",
