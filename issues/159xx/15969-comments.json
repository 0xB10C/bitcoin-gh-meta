Can you explain what your motivation is for opening this? What are you expecting from other contributors?\r\n\r\nA good general principal is that we shouldn't change consensus code unless there are very obvious benefits, and if we do have to make changes, the review bar should be very high indeed. This PR clearly doesn't offer those benefits or meet that bar. Much of the feedback in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14837 also applies here.\r\n\r\nConcept NACK",

What are you expecting from other contributors?\r\n\r\nI think it's explained pretty well, and I don't think anything is being expected of you if you aren't interested in this. People can look at this if they are interested, and if they think they think the new code is an improvement over the old code they can say \"hey this new code is really great\" and maybe make an argument for merging it, or have a discussion, or find problems we didn't previously know about. Not every PR has to be merged, and PRs that aren't merged can still be useful for other reasons.",
