The settings file is supposed to replace some [`QSettings`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsettings.html) uses in `bitcoin-qt`, implementing type-safe persistent storage, and sharing this functionality with `bitcoind`, so settings modified at runtime will be stored in a common place regardless of whether you're using the GUI or a plain RPC interface. (You can see in 0ab41dd770c1f13983df528b111cfc8a51fe016a from #15936 how this works in the GUI or in 04c80c40df9fc6f4734ba238ea7f65607cf88089 from #15937 how this can be used in an RPC.)\r\n\r\n> this is redundant with #11082 which is a better solution.\r\n\r\nEvery solution has some tradeoffs, and I'm sure you can elaborate more on advantages of #11082 compared to this. But here are what I see as nice things about this approach:\r\n\r\n- Standard format. The `bitcoin.conf` format works pretty well as a manual configuration mechanism. But the format is unspecified and unstable, and less appealing for use as persistent key/value store compared to JSON which is well understood and supported by many tools and libraries.\r\n\r\n- Uniformity of representation. Since `bitcoin.conf` files are meant to be written by people and parsed by software, it's reasonable for them to provide many ways to do things like represent true/false values (`foo=1` `foo=` `foo=23` `foo=-1`, `nofoo=0` for true / `foo=0` `nofoo=1` `foo=false` for false), or to strip whitespace. But for a file that is meant to be round-trip read and written by software, only accepting plain `true` `false` keywords as bools and not mangling strings is a better way to avoid complexity, configuration errors, and software bugs.\r\n\r\n- Flexibility of representation. `bitcoin.conf` format can't currently represent strings with pound (`#`) or newline characters or strings with various types of whitespace. It can also only awkwardly represent lists by repeating settings (so there is no distinction between a non-list value and a single-element list). I think these things are likely to cause bugs, unnecessary limitations, headaches, and extra boilerplate in application-level code that reads and writes settings.\r\n\r\n- Maintainability. JSON for all that's good and bad about it is stable and usable enough and isn't going to change. Even writing this PR didn't require adding new parsing or formatting code. By contrast, #11082 not only adds new code right now to parse and generate `bitcoin_rw.conf` files, but will also require more work on an ongoing basis whenever the `bitcoin.conf` format is extended, because any new change will now require roundtrip support. (For example if we added an escaping mechanism it would require new code to escape values in addition to new code parsing escapes.)\r\n\r\nThis PR is also not mutually exclusive with #11082. I don't know exactly what features you wanted to implement on top of #11082, but if you are thinking of new features different from #15936 and #13937 that call for injecting settings into a human-edited config file, nothing in this PR should get in the way of that.\r\n\r\nThere were some other issues I had with #11082 when I reviewed it (adding a new `bitcoin.conf` parser instead of extending the existing one, and concerns about init order and inconsistent interpretation of network sections in `bitcoin.conf` and `bitcoin_rw.conf`), but those issues were specific to the implementation and not inherent to the approach.",

And therefore as a result, even though the settings.json file is intended to be only machine edited, users will end up modifying it anyway and wind up putting settings in a read-write file without comments, that would be more appropriately stored in a read-only file with comments. Let me know if I have this wrong, or if you do think INI format is a better format for dynamic configuration than the JSON format for other reasons that I have not understood.\r\n\r\nBut to follow up, would you be happy with a PR like this one puts settings in a `bitcoin_rw.conf` file with a big warning on top?\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n# bitcoin_rw.conf: Dynamic settings for Bitcoin Core data directory\r\n#\r\n# Warning: DO NOT EDIT this file.

I don't mean to be unfair, but I think we could get the same benefit with less code by just tweaking the current PR and having it save `settings.json.gz` or `settings.json.rot13` files that would also be a pain in the ass to edit.\r\n\r\n> have a limited machine-updatable version of our human-readable config format (luke's PR roughly)\r\n\r\nI do think our current format is pretty terrible (stupid about bool, and lists, can't represent strings containing `#`, etc, see previous comments) and I have other specific issues with Luke's PR (again see previous comments).

Not having dynamic settings means that if you \"shutdown and restart\" you're back to a clean slate which can be good, and could be appropriate for a gui-less daemon. If so, it could just be enough to have some way of viewing/exporting the current dynamic settings from the gui, so you can paste them into your bitcoin.conf. Not really advocating this, but I think it's actually workable.\r\n\r\n> > switch to a different machine-readable format that can do key-value store but isn't tied to the gui (eg bdb, serialize.h, sqlite) \r\n>\r\n> I'm not sure what advantages you see in this approach compared to the current PR, other than that the settings files would be less accessible, so advanced users would be more encouraged to create static configurations where appropriate.\r\n\r\nIt's more that if you've got \"settings.json\" or \"bitcoin_rw.conf\" sitting around, people are going to go \"ah, great, I see what's going on\" and edit it. If they see an sqlite file, they might fire up sqlite, but it'll have a schema so they'll only be able to touch it in fairly sensible ways. If they see a serialize.h or bdb file, they probably won't touch it, but if they do it'll be using tools that will probably get it right and likely won't be surprised if things break. With a .json (or .json.gz or .ini) they're going to go \"oh cool! look what i found!\" and fire up notepad and mess around, and you need to give detailed error messages to help them find their mistakes and manage expectations so they're not terribly surprised when their formatting/comments/ordering/additions disappear or otherwise get mangled.\r\n\r\nUsing sqlite would get the \"avoid rewriting the entire file for changes\" benefit for whatever that's worth.\r\n\r\n> > have a limited machine-updatable version of our human-readable config format (luke's PR roughly)\r\n> \r\n> I do think our current format is pretty terrible (stupid about bool, and lists, can't represent strings containing `#`, etc, see previous comments)\r\n\r\nI don't disagree, but if that's the problem, let's actually work on it and improve the actual config format.

Does it come from an objection to the JSON format, or problems with the univalue implementation, or something else? I wouldn't want univalue to used in application code (in wallet code or consensus code) because string lookups and variant typing lead to c++ code that's verbose, messy, and fragile. But at an API layer, or for accessing config data, univalue seems pretty well-suited, so I wonder what the concerns about it are or were.",

Specifically configuration software like ansible, package managers like nix or guix, build scripts like docker files, should all be setting up their deployments through bitcoin.conf. Managing static software configurations is a big part of what these tools do and why they exist.\r\n\r\nFor bitcoin_rw.conf/settings.json, there are some exceptions I could think of, but mainly I think the only tool that will want to write these files is bitcoin itself. Partly this is due to safety, because with features like #15936 and #15937, settings can change any time while bitcoin is running, so external programs trying to modify these files could see their updates lost. But more importantly, a major motivation for wanting to add dynamic settings is to provide new, less cumbersome ways of updating settings than the raw file system. A user is less likely to screw up something like pruning when the way to enable it is to type a command like `bitcoin-cli config prune 3gb`, and get instant error checking and feedback, than to have to locate their datadir, open a text editor, make changes without running afoul of ini sections syntax and precedence rules, stop bitcoin, restart bitcoin, and check the logs to verify their changes picked up.\r\n\r\nBitcoin isn't pure server software that only needs static configuration, and it isn't pure application software that only needs dynamic configuration. It's P2P software that should support both static and dynamic configuration for different use cases. My expectation is that server admins and advanced users will use bitcoin.conf just like now and always, and for a lot of them to disable dynamic configuration. I would expect more typical users to have no bitcoin.conf file, or only a minimal one from their distro or package manager, and to manage settings through GUI and command interfaces without editing text files.",

      "body" : "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15935#issuecomment-657139770\r\n\r\n> * Adds a THIRD config system for no reason \r\n\r\nThis PR allows #15936 to completely replace QSettings as a source of bitcoin node and wallet settings. There are three sources of node and wallet settings currently (runtime command line settings, stored QSettings, and static bitcoin.conf settings), and there will be 3 sources after this PR and #15936.\r\n\r\n> (Note that QSettings can never be fully removed)\r\n\r\nNot sure why it couldn't be removed, but I think QSettings is a reasonable place to store gui specific settings like window positions, and to have a datadir override. I think we all agree QSettings is not a good place to store node or wallet settings, though.\r\n\r\n> * Difficult for users to edit the new config file (JSON doesn't support comments, even if prettified)\r\n\r\nI think this is an advantage, not a disadvantage, but I'd be curious if there are specific use-cases where it is a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nI think current bitcoin.conf file is good place for static settings. These settings can be provided by distros and packages, and created by more advanced users who are comfortable creating text files, learning a syntax, writing comments, and may want to integrate with their bitcoin configs with version control systems like git, or configurationÂ management systems like ansible.\r\n\r\nThe settings.json file is not intended to be another source of static settings. It is intended to be a storage location for dynamic settings. I don't think users should have to edit text files and start and stop their nodes just so they they can save few settings. They should be able to update settings with real-time error checking using simple GUI and RPC interfaces. I think it's good that the saved settings format doesn't encourage comments or manual editing, because comments for dynamic settings will get outdated as settings are updated, and we don't need an alternative to bitcoin.conf for manual editing.\r\n\r\n> * Impossible to edit externally while the node is running (any changes would just get written over)\r\n\r\nThis is not the case in this PR which just loads and saves settings on startup. #15937 does overwrite settings, though. I think this is fine, but if a different behavior like merging settings is more appropriate, it'd be easy to implement there. Again I think it would be useful to know some specific use cases where this would be a good idea.\r\n\r\n> * Adds complexity for developers (where to put each new setting? multiple systems??)\r\n\r\nSettings from command line, bitcoin.conf, and settings.json are all merged so I don't think there is a concern about where to put settings. Unclear what the specific concern or demand is here.\r\n\r\n> * Better alternative already exists and is well-tested (in Knots) for years (#11082, rwconf)\r\n\r\nI reviewed #11082 in detail (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11082#pullrequestreview-186204085) and wrote this PR to be a more robust alternative. I think knots can pretty easily stay backwards compatible by loading the ini file and calling WriteSettings, if that's the specific concern.\r\n\r\n> * Introduces UniValue into non-RPC code modules\r\n\r\nAgain I see this as an advantage not a disadvantage. If there is a new settings source, there has to be some new API for reading and writing settings. UniValue for all its quirks is a reasonable way of passing settings values around a simple API. It's easier to use, higher level, and more flexible than the new api from #11082:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n  void ModifyRWConfigFile(const std::map<std::string, std::string>& settings_to_change);\r\n  void ModifyRWConfigFile(const std::string& setting_to_change, const std::string& new_value);\r\n  void EraseRWConfigFile();\r\n```\r\n\r\nUniValue is also familiar and already used in thousands of lines of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\nAnother nice side effect of using UniValue is that it avoids the need to add [new parsing code](https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin/blob/78bc86711a8e6ef3e43402c42d84874161ad0033/src/util/system.cpp#L932-L1092), partially duplicating [existing parsing code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d52bfc49161721fd55b9312549b3da674da387fe/src/util/system.cpp#L670-L713) that will need to be kept in sync. I also think it's possible that as [well tested](https://github.com/luke-jr/bitcoin/blob/78bc86711a8e6ef3e43402c42d84874161ad0033/src/test/util_tests.cpp#L2178-L2315) as the #11082 new parsing code may be, UniValue probably has better test coverage and has been through more testing for correctness and vulnerabilities at this point, like the test suite I added https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue/pull/30.\r\n\r\nUniValue also has support for list settings, which the #11082 API does not support. And it does not mangle strings. It has no problem with `#` or `\\n` characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
