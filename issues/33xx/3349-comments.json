      "body" : "Closing this, I don't think this can be achieved in bitcoin-cli, through RPC.\r\n\r\nI still think this functionality is seful; e.g. I have a deploy script for a few nodes that stops them, uploads a new version of bitcoind, and starts them again. But that needs to be sure that the daemon is no longer running. But as this is local-only I'm going to use an external script that just waits for the pid to die, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n    pid_t pid = ReadPidFile(); \r\n    while(kill(pid, 0) == 0)\r\n        usleep(250000);\r\n```\r\n",
