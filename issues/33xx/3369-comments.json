If I remember correctly the problem was that outgoing transactions, while being unconfirmed, are still taken into account with the getbalance methods, leading to wrong results.\r\nCompared with messing around with the getbalance method (including the non-intuitive account handling...) the new \"getunconfirmedbalance\" method seems quite straightforward and does exactly what it says.",

I am running a site that works a lot with unconfirmed transactions, raw transactions and a very custom coin control implementation, so I am aware of the risks involved. \r\nThe highlevel usecase i need this for is very simple. I have a job running every few minutes that collects from bitcoind both confirmed and unconfirmed balance. If any of the values is outside a certain threshhold I am getting notified to investigate or take measures. I just could not get the unconfirmed balance reliable with the existing rpc \"getbalance\" command, while this pull request makes it very easy :)",
