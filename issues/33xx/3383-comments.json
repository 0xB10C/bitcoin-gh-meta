Multi-balance has existed since the beginning of bitcoin, in the form of confirmed/unconfirmed balance.  Add on top of that multi-sig.  On top of that, locked outputs.  Adding public-key-only to the wallet is elegant and does not overly complicate the existing multi-balance situation.\r\n\r\nThe alternatives only truly make sense if multi-wallet support is deployed and fleshed out, making it trivial to divide up your coins across wallets without restarts etc.  Otherwise, your choice is either running N copies of bitcoind -- in parallel if real-time wallet access is required, or this pull req.\r\n\r\nThat is the fundamental design choice.  We are not close to multi-wallet, and this PR has people actively using it.  This and coin control are two features that seem to continue to be requested, and IMO, need to be pushed based on user feedback.\r\n",

So, this is correct. It would be more clear if the method were renamed to CWallet::IsRelevant or something.\r\n* The NotifyAddressBoolChanged signal passes a bool along to indicate whether a destination is ours or not. If we wanted to distinguish in the GUI whether listed addresses of ours are considered spendable-from, then it may make sense to upgrade that bool to an isminetype, but that will depend on the GUI using it for something.",

Prior to this point, we were heavily dependent upon blockchain.info's rawaddr/total_received API function. With hot-button topics such as transaction malleability, MITM attacks, and further decentralization of the bitcoin network. It would be immensely useful to leverage watch-only (e.g. public keys only) wallets when integrating a web app with bitcoind.",

I would like to propose an alternative idea here and get your thoughts on it.\r\n\r\nMy alternative idea is to have bitcoind compile an index of all the existing utxos in the blockchain, with the address as the key.\r\n\r\nThis is not related to the wallet. Instead, it's exactly the same idea as the `txindex`. You could have a flag to bitcoind when it starts as such:\r\n\r\n`utxoindex=1`\r\n\r\nSignaling that you would like this. Then, there could be an api call to retreive the current list of utxos for addresses:\r\n\r\n`getutxos <address> [confirmations]`\r\n\r\nOr something similar. It wouldn't be a wallet or related to the wallet code - it would just be an index of utxos, simple as that.\r\n\r\nDoes this satiate the concerns core has with the watchonly patch?",

It's also lead to stability issues when for example blockchain.info had a database issue and had to manually rescan their entire database. It's a really byzantine solution to the problem, one that is best handled by bitcoind IMHO and really could have nothing to do with the wallet code.",
