   "body" : "This patch improves performance and resource usage around IP addresses that are banned for misbehavior. They're already not actually banned since #14929, as connections from them are still allowed, but they are preferred for eviction if the inbound connection slots are full.\r\n\r\nStop treating these like manually banned IP ranges, and instead just keep them in a rolling Bloom filter of misbehaving nodes, which isn't persisted to disk or exposed through the ban framework. The effect remains the same: preferred for eviction, avoided for outgoing connections, and not relayed to other peers.\r\n\r\nAlso change the name of this mechanism to \"discouraged\" to better reflect reality.",
