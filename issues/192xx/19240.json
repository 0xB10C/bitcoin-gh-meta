This is suboptimal as our goal is to have a toolchain that can target macOS, which (in Xcode.app) has its own set of `libc++` headers that can [differ from those of the clang package](https://gist.github.com/fanquake/9315a02416f56d1545dfef7f9c75bc45). It seems to me that given our goal, it is better to use what Apple intends, and not rely on upstream `clang` <-> Apple `clang` compatibility.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis requires a regeneration of the macOS SDK. Please follow the updated instructions [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19240/files?short_path=9de36be#diff-9de36befe13356841c2699ee0eff4a0a). (I'm linking to the Markdown diff so that people who need to regenerate the macOS SDK can see the difference in procedure from before)",
