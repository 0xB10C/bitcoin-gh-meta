Did this help with the variance from before?\r\n\r\nI don't want to go overkill but I wonder if there's a nicer way to communicate the start warming/stop warming instructions (e.g. not just tweaking flags so there's some sort of interface). I also wonder if it makes sense to just always completely finish warming the cache or not? Aborting warming early still means the work has to happen in serial (at some point) with the main thread. Is there ever a circumstance where the warmer gets the cache full that it evicts its own warmed entries? Can we detect this and just stop then?\r\n\r\n",
