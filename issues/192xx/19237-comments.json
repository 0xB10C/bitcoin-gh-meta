Something exercising these code paths (plus assertions):\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nconst std::vector<uint8_t> serialized_pub_key{4, 4, 0, 0, 0};\r\nCDataStream data_stream{serialized_pub_key, SER_NETWORK, INIT_PROTO_VERSION};\r\nCPubKey pub_key;\r\ndata_stream >> pub_key;\r\n(void)pub_key.IsFullyValid();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps also a test case where `ReadCompactSize(s)` returns zero to cover that case too :)",

      "body" : "@elichai Great! Another very nice thing with your fix is that it addresses another `CPubKey` oddity which I reported back in issue #17238: serialization-deserialization roundtrip of `CPubKey` did not necessarily result in an equal object. `CPubKey` was the only deserializable class that had that unexpected behaviour which made it a potential future gotcha. Glad to see it fixed too :)\r\n\r\nMore specifically â¦\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nCPubKey pk1;\r\nCDataStream s1{std::vector<uint8_t>{'\\x01', '\\x72'}, SER_NETWORK, INIT_PROTO_VERSION};\r\ns1 >> pk1;\r\n\r\nCDataStream s2{SER_NETWORK, INIT_PROTO_VERSION};\r\ns2 << pk1;\r\n\r\nCPubKey pk2;\r\ns2 >> pk2;\r\n\r\nassert(pk1 == pk2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nâ¦ used to result in â¦\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssertion `pk1 == pk2' failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nâ¦ but now passes (as expected). Note that the assertion failure was not due to UUM: no UUM takes place in this specific example.\r\n\r\nMight be worth adding a test case also for that too, and perhaps also enable this commented out code from the `CPubKey` deserialization fuzzer:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6762a627ecb89ba8d4ed81a049a5d802e6dd75c2/src/test/fuzz/deserialize.cpp#L118-L122",
