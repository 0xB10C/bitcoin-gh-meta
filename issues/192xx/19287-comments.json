As an implementation detail of CPython (not PyPy or others) `x is y` actually compares memory addresses, because on CPython `id(x)` returns the memory address of x.\r\n\r\n> the only built-in type where that is acceptable (and maybe recommended) to use is `None`.\r\n\r\nTrue 99% of the time, mainly because `None` is a singleton. There are a few, rare corner cases, e,g. using an `object()` as a sentinel value https://python-patterns.guide/python/sentinel-object/\r\n\r\n> Did you also check the functional test files and other python files in this repo for similar sharp edges?\r\n\r\nI didn't.
