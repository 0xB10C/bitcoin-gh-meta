Since some software may be checking for the existence of a `witness_utxo` to determine whether to produce a segwit signature, we keep that field to ease the transition.\r\n\r\nBecause all of the sanity checks implemented by the `IsSane` functions were related to having mixed segwit and non-segwit data in a PSBT, those functions are removed as those checks are no longer proper.\r\n\r\nSome tests are updated/removed to accommodate this and a simple test added to check that both UTXOs are being added to segwit inputs.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the wallet IRC meeting, our own signer will not require `non_witness_utxo` for segwit inputs.",
