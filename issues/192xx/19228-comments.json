      "body" : "cc @elichai who worked on many of those PRs.\r\n\r\nWe renamed the `privkey_*` functions because the naming was inconsistent. They still work but API users should call `seckey_*` functions, see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/701/commits/41fc78560223aa035d9fe2cbeedb3ee632c740e2 .  Can you add a commit that changes the calls in `key.cpp` (`privkey_negate`, `privkey_tweak`)? This could be done in a separate PR but I think it belongs here conceptually. edit: We may in fact remove the wrapper for `privkey_negate` because it is used nowhere.\r\n\r\nWe also made changes to `ecdsa_signature_parse_der_lax` in `contrib/lax_der_parsing.c`. Unfortunately this is a small mess now. The copy of this function in `pubkey.cpp` has diverged from the secp256k1 version due to #10657 and #11073 which were simply merged here without upstreaming them to secp256k1. Some of our secp256k1 changes reinvent those in #10657 (with the exact same diff) because I was not aware of the divergence when I proposed them. The remaining differences are:\r\n * #11073 removed a dead store in `pubkey.cpp`. We can simply upstream this change to secp256k1.\r\n * #10657 added `static_assert` checks. But those are already covered by `assumptions.h`. In fact, this is even mentioned as an example in `assumptions.h`. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fed1a9043fdf802c7cf7eab1c8aab25ca1c90e8d/src/compat/assumptions.h#L55-L58 So we could simply remove the assertions in `pubkey.cpp`.\r\n\r\nIf we do those two changes (the second change belonging to this repo), we will have a clean copy of `ecdsa_signature_parse_der_lax` again. But maybe this is non-trivial enough to go to a second PR. I'm volunteering to open a PR after I digged through all the stuff now.",
