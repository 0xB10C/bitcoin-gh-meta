In addition to RPC usage, it's probably also less susceptible to graphical operating systems messing with quote marks.\r\n\r\nI'm on the fence regarding private keys. At least our RPC should not echo private keys, so it would have to return the checksum without the rest of the descriptor. There could be a separate checksum_private return field for this case.\r\n\r\nCan you update the PR description to say `getdescriptorinfo` instead of `getaddressinfo` (assuming that's what you meant)?",

The only reason `'` was being used was because that was the the derivation path that the wallet stored for each key. However since derivation paths are now stored as integer values, it should be fine and safe to change everywhere it is displayed to use `h`. Note that we still may need to have the wallet continue to write out `'` in the derivation path string in `CKeyMetaData` for backwards compatibility reasons, but that string shouldn't be displayed anymore so it doesn't really matter.",
