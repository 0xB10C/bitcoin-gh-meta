This would need to be performed by the code signer.\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, the binary package will then be recognized by GateKeeper, providing that an active internet connection is available. It is possible to \"staple\" the notarization receipt to the binary package so that an internet connection is not required, but that would change it's sha256sum, which would no longer match the hashes from gitian's output.\r\n\r\nNote: There is an intermittent bug in Apple's notarization system that may block the binary from being notarized properly.

For those interested, here is what I needed to do to automate the task on travis:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/btcpayserver/BTCPayServer.Vault/blob/master/Build/travis/applesign.sh\r\n\r\nBasically, I needed to:\r\n* extract the unsigned dmg,\r\n* sign the app,\r\n* rebundle the app as a dmg,\r\n* sign the dmg,\r\n* notarize the dmg,\r\n* wait that it succeed\r\n* Apply the staple to the dmg\r\n\r\nNote that applying the staple to the dmg is optional. However, if you don't apply it, gatekeeper will need internet connection to verify the dmg.\r\n\r\nI think that I should also **staple the .App folder** itself and not only the dmg if I wanted gatekeeper to be 100% happy when offline. (yes, you can staple the .App folder... I have no idea why it works, where the staple get saved?)\r\nThe documentation is very bad, so I don't really know...\r\n\r\nIf you want to also staple the `.App` I think you need a two steps notarization: First the `.App` folder as a tar file, then the dmg after it has been built.\r\n\r\nTake a good note about the parameters I passed to `codesign`, this took a while to get right.",
