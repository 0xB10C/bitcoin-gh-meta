But apparently it was not in 0.17, and the code I'm currently running is already different from HEAD, as this was refactored in #15497. I am very perplexed as to how the code I'm looking at is generating the help text I'm seeing, and I wonder if there's a bug in RPCHelpMan, but I don't know that it's worth chasing, since the code has changed at HEAD and I'm not willing to rebase up right now to see if that fixed it.",
