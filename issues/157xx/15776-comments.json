      "body" : "That seems like a potentially very bad bug.  However at first glance I don't see how `fPauseSend` could be implicated as a trigger; I don't believe we ever drop requests on the floor if the send buffer fills up, we just wait until the buffer drains and then continue as before. \r\n\r\nActually, I realize now that one way this could maybe trigger is if our peer sends a NOTFOUND in response to a getdata, I don't think we would reduce the in flight count (I think this is fixed in #15505 but this seems like a bug in 0.18).  So over time, as NOTFOUND's pile up, the in-flight queue would get full and we'd stop requesting transactions.  So we should definitely take some kind of fix for this, yikes.",
