   "body" : "Gets rid of `Chain::requestMempoolTransactions` method added in #15652\r\n\r\nBenefits of the change:\r\n\r\n- Possibly faster wallet creation, avoids requesting mempool transactions when wallet is newly created.\r\n- Reduces scope of cs_main/cs_wallet/mempool locks. Gets rid of some recursive locking in postInitProcess.\r\n- Simplifies the Chain interface to drop requestMempoolTransactions \r\n- Simplifies usage of the Chain interface to not have TransactionAddedToMempool called sometimes without cs_main lock, sometimes with.\r\n- Simplifies usage of the Chain interface for notifications to be sent in order from one thread, and to not have old add/remove mempool notifications showing up after the wallet is first loaded.\r\n- Better performance over IPC. Mempool transactions are sent in a single IPC call instead of in a loop calling an IPC method repeatedly.\r\n- Annoy Marco with some new tediously long code comments and std::future code.",
