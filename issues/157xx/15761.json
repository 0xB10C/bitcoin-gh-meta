   "body" : "`-upgradewallet` is largely incompatible with many recent wallet features and versions. For example, it was disabled if multiple wallets were used and would not work with encrypted wallets that were being upgraded to HD.\r\n\r\nThis PR does away with the old method of upgrading upon startup and instead allows users to upgrade their wallets via an `upgradewallet` RPC. This does largely the same thing as the old `-upgradewallet` option but because the wallet is loaded, it can be unlocked to upgrade to HD. Furthermore it is compatible with multiwallet as it works on the individual wallet that is specified by the RPC.",
