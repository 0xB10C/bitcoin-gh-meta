I'm in no rush for this to get merged, and would much prefer to see progress on #15638, so I'm going to try to avoid causing rebases for Russ.\r\n\r\n(incidentally, 15638 is a very easy review. It's almost entirely move-only and all the commits are well commented, so in theory at least it should be possible to review/merge quite quickly).",
