(Regrettably, it's hard for me to recommend a specific one; the developers are generally available on Freenode IRC, but it's important not to trust anybody whose bonafides you can't verify, and -- you probably already know this, but to be sure -- in general do not trust _anybody_ with private keys, or any bitcoin output you aren't _completely sure_ does not contain or reveal private keys. The actual developers will be scrupulously careful to avoid asking you for anything that would reveal them.)\r\n\r\nI recommend at least redacting the amount.",
