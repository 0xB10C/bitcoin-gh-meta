I.e. any tx that could replace (due to higher fee) another tx from the previous block that is in getblocktemplate of the same size as the previous block. This re-send could happen with a higher poisson timeout to avoid network-wide spikes in bandwidth events.\r\n\r\nThe initial relay of wallet transactions should happen in a relay mechanism completely separate from the current mempool/inv logic. Txs are added to the mempool when they \"come back\" from other peers. Only if they never come back, the classical ATMP+fluff should be used.",
