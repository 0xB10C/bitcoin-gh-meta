Currently additional RPC calls will be needed to look up the height of the final block in the window or the block height that began the window.\r\n\r\nBy adding the block height of the final block in the window, the JSON is \"self-contained\" and applications can calculate the exact block height range of the window with no additional RPC requests.\r\n\r\n",
