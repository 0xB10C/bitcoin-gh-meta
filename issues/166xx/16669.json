Feel free to create your own forks etc.\".\r\n\r\nHowever, a fork has emerged, https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode, that has incorporated\r\ntheuni's patches ([add the -pem option in extract-signature mode ](https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode/commit/36715c11836d07709aff822154a0eed2c43ed5a5) & [add the attach-signature command](https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode/commit/3be7eb1676a8af8afd9e0aa03e4cac651da14c23)) as well as updated the tool to work with OpenSSL 1.1 and other improvements.\r\n\r\nThis commit switches the windows signer descriptor to use this new version of `osslsigncode`.\r\n\r\nI've tested using this new version of `osslsigncode` while doing a 0.18.1 gitian build, and it \"seems\" to work. However this needs a look over from Cory, to check if the tool is still compatible with his usage in the [`detached-sig-create.sh`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/windeploy/detached-sig-create.sh) script, as well as some review of the changes to `osslsigncode` itself. Hence WIP and chasing Concept ACKs / NACKs.",
