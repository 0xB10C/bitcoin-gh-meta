   "body" : "This PR was part of #16115 but reviewers requested that this be made into a separate PR. As explained in #16115, it's useful, maybe even crucial, for support, analysis, and debugging purposes for the configuration arguments to be present in the `debug.log` file, as that may be the only artifact provided to the developer or support team. That PR logs the configuration settings (command-line arguments and `bitcoin.conf` contents) when `bitcoind` starts. But sometime later, the debug log file may be \"rotated\" (a new `debug.log` file started so it doesn't grow unbounded in size) and this information would be lost unless the previous `debug.log` is preserved.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-logs the configuration information when the log rotates, ensuring that the current `debug.log` file contains this information. Reviewers had reservations about the previous approach (which you can see in #16115's discussion thread), so this PR implements this functionality in a simpler and (I believe) much better way.\r\n\r\nSince this PR is based on the #16115 branch (it depends on changes made there), don't review first two commits here as they are part of that PR.",
