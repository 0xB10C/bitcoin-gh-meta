The only direct consequence of these changes I can think of is a user having to call abandontransaction a 2nd time if block get disconnected and transaction is not back in mempool.\r\n\r\nThis change would make easier to track conflicts, where if conflicting transaction get UNCONFIRMED, iterate on conflicted outpoints and make them free.\r\n\r\nMaybe, I can avoid update right now for UNCONFIRMED state, so a tx is born in this state but never go backward to it, and save implications for a later PR ?",
