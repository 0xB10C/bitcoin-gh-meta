      "body" : "On backporting:\r\n\r\nI think the rough plan is to, as of 0.22, no longer worry about backporting features to 0.20 or below unless easy to do. Already we don't regularly backport 2 releases back, but end users may be doing their own back porting.\r\n\r\nThis means that modules like consensus can start using c++17 features more aggressively in 0.22, and mildly in 0.21 where there's a shim that can be implemented without much overhead.\r\n\r\nAn open question for 0.21 is if the backport shims can rely on other libraries; e.g., using boost option shim (which we already have in the code, but could cut with a c++17 build). For example, libconsensus 0.20 could be built with c++17 with no shims, and c++11 with shims, that might be sufficient for most users. Instead of dealing with this complex build issue, we can also wait until 0.22 to deploy boost in those contexts. The shim question is important because it points to needing a more rigorous definition of what c++11 compatibility means, but that seems to be an open question. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I think if 0.20 can be c++17 built, we can immediately start using c++17 APIs in new code for 0.21, and make 0.20 backports c++17 released without shims (by the time there is an important backport, c++17 support will only be better!), but this is probably a bit more aggressive than necessary.",
