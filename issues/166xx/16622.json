   "body" : "1. Echo the property tests status during builds. Property-based tests are silently auto-enabled by default if librapidcheck is found. This commit allows users to see their build status.\r\n\r\n2. Improve the `--with-rapidcheck` package option help and code docs.\r\n\r\n3. Add a `--disable-prop-tests` feature option. For now, it does the same as the rapidcheck option, with the essential difference that it documents in `./configure --help` how to disable them. This is helpful because the prop tests are enabled by default if librapidcheck is found, yet are an experimental feature and can block builds with compilation errors. It seems to me it would be user-friendly to show how to disable them in the help.\r\n\r\nBuild output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptions used to compile and link:\r\n  with wallet   = yes\r\n  with gui / qt = yes\r\n    with bip70  = yes\r\n    with qr     = yes\r\n  with zmq      = yes\r\n  with test     = yes\r\n    with prop   = yes\r\n    with fuzz   = no\r\n  with bench    = no\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfigure --help output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptional Features:\r\n  --disable-tests         do not compile tests (default is to compile)\r\n  --disable-gui-tests     do not compile GUI tests (default is to compile if\r\n                          GUI and tests enabled)\r\n  --disable-prop-tests    disable property-based tests (enabled by default if\r\n                          librapidcheck is found)\r\n  --disable-bench         do not compile benchmarks (default is to compile)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nOptional Packages:\r\n  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]\r\n  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)\r\n...\r\n  --with-miniupnpc        enable UPNP (default is yes if libminiupnpc is\r\n                          found)\r\n  --with-rapidcheck       build with RapidCheck property-based tests (default\r\n                          is yes if librapidcheck is found)\r\n  --with-qrencode         enable QR code support (default is yes if qt is\r\n                          enabled and libqrencode is found)\r\n```",
