   "body" : "While working on this PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18570 I ran into a bit confusing situation where in one function a **CWallet reference** was expected while two others dealt with **CWallet pointers**. My initial reaction was: `let's harmonize them by making them references`. However, not being part of the PR itself I did't change anything and completed the PR first.\r\n\r\nNow, after having analyzed the `rpcwallet.cpp` code I came to the conclusion that:\r\n\r\n* converting them all into references is not the solution as they're originally **shared_ptr**s\r\n* but also: there is no (visible) reason why every RPC function should begin like this:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstd::shared_ptr<CWallet> const pwallet = GetWalletForJSONRPCRequest(request);\r\nconst CWallet* const pwallet = wallet.get();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis clearly defeats the purpose of shared pointers for no obvious reason. *Maybe I am missing something?*\r\n\r\nIn my (unpublished) [code changes](https://github.com/brakmic/bitcoin/commit/0b3ee615491edf6f542631bf6ae6f72eac406550) all raw pointers got replaced with **shared_ptr**s but kept their original names (that is, *pwallet*). In the end, they're pointers too, so the most of the original code remained untouched.\r\n\r\nHowever, some of the helper functions couldn't be changed because external code is accessing them and I didn't want to make this task \"virulent\". So I introduced new (\"Ref\") variants that expect **shared_ptr** parameters, namely: \r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid EnsureWalletRefIsUnlocked(const std::shared_ptr<CWallet>);\r\nbool EnsureWalletRefIsAvailable(const std::shared_ptr<CWallet>, bool avoidException);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tested the code, with python and boost-tests, and could not find any errors. \r\nBut before opening a PR I would like to open a discussion about this. \r\n\r\nIs there any reason to keep on working with raw pointers when every function call actually begins with *shared_ptr*s?\r\n\r\nRegards,",
