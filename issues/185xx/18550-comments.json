      "body" : "I'm not sure this change is worth it and doesn't introduce more strange behaviors. If goal is to retroactively fix detection of change addresses in v0.19 wallets, this seems like it would simpler and be more convenient to use as a standalone wallet tool function.\r\n\r\nAs I understand things, #13756 in v0.19 introduced a bug where change addresses might be marked in a way where they are treated as non-change. #18192 in v0.20 fixed this by correctly interpreting all change addresses as change.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this PR is it could be useful to someone who wants to keep running 0.19 software and have it keep incorrectly interpreting change addresses as non-change, but then periodically load up the wallet in a 0.20 node to tweak the database, so when they reload the wallet back in 0.19, the 0.19 software will now correctly see all change addresses as change (until it adds more change addresses that get misinterpreted and it is necessary to fix up the database with 0.20 again).\r\n\r\nThis seems like a pretty unusual use case and also one that would be less awkwardly handled with a standalone `bitcoin-wallet` tool function that just deletes the \"used\" destdata entries instead of storing them in a different way where the 0.19 code can't find them and 0.20 code now has to look for them",
