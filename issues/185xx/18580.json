   "body" : "Since we currently use QT LTS releases for building Bitcoin Core we may run into a problem as LTS releases are [being dropped](https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-offering-changes-2020) from the open source part of the QT project.\r\n\r\nThere are also [reports](https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-community/2020q2/006098.html) that QT may end up entirely abandoning open source for all QT releases less than 12 months old.\r\n\r\nSince it appears in both of these cases they will not be providing security fixes in a timely manner we may want to start planning how best to deal with these unfortunate changes.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding the QT parts of Bitcoin Core have minimal attack surface due to how we use QT but I'm not entirely sure.",
