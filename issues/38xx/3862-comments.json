Only then it makes sense to discuss it as default.\r\n\r\n(edit: this may sound overly negative, to be clear I'm in favor of moving to uBTC display eventually, but changing the default in bitcoin-qt should not be the first step)\r\n\r\n",

Few financial systems support 8 dp and this convention is a barrier in the path of Bitcoin's growth.\r\n\r\nBecause XBT has already some momentum there is a case for another new ISO code, hence:\r\n\r\nXBT = 1 Bitcoin\r\nXBU = 1 microbitcoin\r\n\r\nIf XBU is supported internally within Bitcoin Core then the benefits of 2dp can be realized. The GUI should probably default to BTC but allow XBT and XBU as user selectable options.\r\n",

What WOULD actually make a difference would be for BitStamp, Coinbase, Blockchain.Info, BitPay, Kraken, Coinsetter, itBit, BTC Foundation, etc. (as many as possible) to get together, agree on the plan, agree on a switch date, create unified marketing material, and then do a coordinated rollout and media blast. Unfortunately, all of these guys probably have way bigger fish to fry right now, so good luck with that.",

So, the thrust of the OP could be considered in two parts:\r\na) try to push the market convention to uBTC\r\nb) allow for easier interoperability with legacy financial and accounting systems using uBTC.\r\n\r\nIMHO \"b\" is easier and better tackled first.\r\n\r\nExample of the Bitcoin-qt transaction export csv\r\n\"Confirmed\",\"Date\",\"Type\",\"Label\",\"Address\",\"Amount\",\"ID\"\r\nIt needs \"Currency\" appended and the column populated with an appropriate ISO or pseudo-ISO depending upon whether Amount is BTC or uBTC\r\n\r\n@whistlack: few non-Bitcoin systems can cope with a major:minor ratio of 1:100,000,000",

      "body" : "@rcornea respectfully have to disagree - there is a ton of legacy software that is NOT going to be rewritten just because some new kid on the block wants integration.\r\n\r\nA lot of people seem to think that this conversation is around exchanges and the like. That is simply not the case - software like that will already be capable of a large number of decimal places. This is more for something like an accounting package. Virtually all of the SME accounting packages out there support 2 decimal places. There are no bookkeeping transactions that require more. If you're charging interest on a late account you round up or round down to the nearest cent, and that final value is what is stored. No accounting software will bill a client $10.42 in interest but actually store it as 10.418394887439.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for point of sales systems (POS), such as at a bar or restaurant. Many of them support multiple currencies, but do not support more than 2 decimal places. If you have a table at a restaurant and you charge a % surcharge for 8+ seaters, the POS will calculate it and round to the nearest cent. That 2 decimal place value is what is presented on the bill, it is what is paid, and it is what is stored in the accounting backend.\r\n\r\nI think this makes complete sense - let's rip the band-aid and make it happen. If there are sites using 1 XBT == 1 BTC they are not common, and their developers will surely have no problem changing the nomenclature of the site back to BTC. We've discussed this around the dev team and nobody has even stumbled across a site actively using XBT in that manner (admittedly a small sample size and thus anecdotal, but nonetheless).",

He makes two addresses: one associated with the choice of switching defaults to micro-BTC and one with the choice of leaving defaults to BTC. A time limit is set for voting. The address that gets more coins is the most supported choice and gets implemented. All coins are sent to the chosen charity.

      "body" : "I find this discussion mildly amusing because there appears to be a consensus amongst developers that a successful (is no longer an experiment) bitcoin won't be used by normal people for daily transactions (cup of coffee, newspaper, etc.). This builds atop the fact that bitcoin is already unusable for micro transactions as it simply doesn't (and will never again) scale to transactions of hundredths of a US cent.\r\n\r\nInstead, so their theory goes, bitcoin will become a settlement currency. It will be used to trade value amongst trusted systems or amongst contract participants (escrow, smart contracts, coloured coins etc.)\r\n\r\nSo it's a bit dishonest talking about the perceptions of the man in the street, if the man in the street is merely a vehicle to move bitcoin out of its experimental phase into its settlement-currency phase.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the programmers who are interfacing bitcoin with \"financial systems\" can't grok that bitcoin is an integer in the range 0 to 2,100,000,000,000,000 (approximately :-) then we're fucking doomed.\r\n\r\nI wish Satoshi had defined more significant digits (at least 6 more) and I wish the developers didn't view the ultimate future as being that of a settlement-currency, i.e. that scalability to micro transactions was a goal.\r\n\r\nBut we're stuck with what we've got and the maths of scalability are hard to argue with. Within, say, 10 years bitcoin will be solely a settlement currency if it survives as a medium of exchange. Humans will be transacting in other currencies (pegged or floating, closed-trusted or open peer-to-peer) against bitcoin. Bitcoin the currency will disappear from plain sight in the same way as SWIFT or BACS.\r\n\r\nSo in my view, this is merely a middle-term user-interface problem - and it should be recognised as such. There is no future in which we get an extra 6 digits of precision, so there's no need to worry about whether we might have to \"shift the decimal point _again_\". There will never be micro transactions, because of scalability, so humans are going to stop transacting peer-to-peer in bitcoins eventually, anyway.\r\n\r\nWith all that understood, \"bit\" really does seem like the most human-friendly name for the middle term. \"dorian\" would be my close second vote. \r\n\r\nMost people still don't know what a megabyte is and no, I don't mean that most people can't work out whether it's 1,000,000 bytes or 1,048,576 bytes. I mean that they don't know the scale, whether mega is a thousand or a million or something else.\r\n\r\nCounting zeroes left of the decimal point is only mildly less painful than counting those right of it: a cup of tea that currently costs 0.0025 BTC would cost 2500 bits. \r\n\r\nCounting fees in bits is definitely amusing: currently the suggested fee is  0.1 bits per byte :) And the proposed new fee is 100 bytes per bit.\r\n\r\nMaybe dorians is the way to go after all.\r\n\r\nRegardless, a commonly agreed unit corresponding with 100 satoshis appears to be a step forward in easing the adoption of bitcoin the currency.\r\n\r\ntldr: dorian may be the least confusing name for 100 satoshis, for the period that humans are still transacting in bitcoin before (if) it becomes a settlement currency.",

I'm familiar with the thread you linked and its technique to route around scalability issues presented by the blockchain itself. In fact that thread defines a use-case for bitcoin as a settlement currency :)\r\n\r\nOff-blockchain transactions means there will be no pressure to add significant digits. And payment channels are a trust-less though very close neighbour of trusted payment services/channels (such as that offered by Coinbase, where customers of Coinbase can transact in bitcoin without hitting the blockchain). The currency seen by the user of the latter kind of channel is not necessarily bitcoin and it seems to me that trustless channels for micro transactions can be denominated in something else that's directly convertible to bitcoin, so that settlements are all that's needed on bitcoin's blockchain.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I support a unit of 100 satoshis, for whatever timespan people individually interact with the blockchain.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've been running the reference client (and mining) for nearly 3 years - thanks for your and others' hard work.",

But it was easier when community was smaller. \r\n\r\nI know you have a lot of cooler and more important stuff to care about in the core. But just as you think about how core changes may influence future scalability, it may be helpful to think how they may influence future widespread adoption. It's not up to you, but it can be.\r\n\r\nMost people just don't know SI units. It's a fact that seems weird when you are surrounded by tech/science people. Even for for those who do, 0.00005 requires a bit longer to process than 500 000. Use of small fractions is so unpopular, that we don't even have any standard way to separate these zeroes.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry for dropping in without code here, I do believe that this decision should be based on devs rational thinking and not some community polls, because a single person voice (who takes time to think things through) is much more valuable than 50 other people who just act like a swarm. Keep up the good work.",

It just doesn't work - we're inevitably going to come up with something 90% of the actual Bitcoin-using population thinks is awkward or even ridiculous just by the fact that we're not them and don't understand their worldview. If users feel the need to talk about uBTC they *will* switch - it's just an option. If they don't, they don't. Trying to figure out what's right with anything less than a top-tier advertising/design firm is bound to fail - this stuff is legitimately hard and those consultants genuinely earn their money.
