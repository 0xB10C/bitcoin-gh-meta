      "body" : "While rebasing it came to mind that maybe these pow-specific constants don't really belong to chainparams. There could be a pow class with them as arguments and having these functions as methods.\r\nThis would make it easier for altchains to maintain: just be extending this class and overwriting the pow functions many altcoins would become trivial to maintain on top of bitcoin (less excuses to compete for development resources).\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, Freicoin uses the same SHA256 pow as bitcoin, and although I got to this pool request by looking for the places I would need to touch for implementing private chains (also non-bitcoinish), the main objective of the PR is nothing but getting things that belong together out of main.\r\nWell, now that I think about it we have a different difficulty filter so a pow class should help with our maintainability, although I don't think it will be a great difference with this functions already separated.\r\nThe question remains, in this case that it's clear it has no benefit at all for bitcoin, is it desirable to facilitate things for projects based on bitcoin's codebase or not?\r\nThe ideal solution for altchains would be to directly include the functions on chainparams, similar to to what @luke-jr previously proposed and what it's done in libcoin to make the library \"chain agnostic\" : https://github.com/libcoin/libcoin/blob/master/src/coinChain/Chain.cpp\r\nbut that seems incompatible with the objective of maintaining only constant values on chainparams. Also, it could negatively affect bitcoin's modularity if you start to encapsulates many differences from different places other than pow in there, chainparams. It could easily morph into a hard to maintain beast if you start to try to be \"agnostic\" in relation to, say, a chain with explicit support for asset issuance.\r\nSo it seems a Pow class would be more rational for bitcoin even if it requires a little more work from the altchain developers than the chain-agnostic approach.\r\nBut still, a class instead of the independent functions and the constants in chainparams (this PR as it currently stands) doesn't offer anything interesting to bitcoind's code itself. \r\nThat change wouldn't imply any risks because it would be a trivial refactoring like moving the constants to chainparams. \r\nSorry for getting so long and reiterative, maybe this belongs to the mailing list, but it's just seems a simple and interesting example to debate a general policy for \"non-bitcoinish\" contribution. To define more clearly what kind of things can be accepted and which would represent unnecessary weight for bitcoin.\r\nI'm particularly interested in @gavinandresen @mikehearn and @drak 's options, since they have expressed some concerns about making it easier for other projects to just rebase on top of bitcoin's latest version and try to keep the differences minimal and the general improvements in bitcoin.\r\nI can also move this discussion to another PR with some actual code that shows the little differences more clearly instead of the mailing list, and leave this one as the simple \"move things out of main one functional thing at a time\" it is.\r\nWhatever you think it's best.",
