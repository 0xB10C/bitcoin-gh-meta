Oddly with Armory (which I can't get working on Linux ) my transactions would confirm faster even with smaller fees, so this behavior is sorta unexpected. \r\n\r\nMy proposal would be to have the ability to bump a transaction somehow by ADDING just the fee. This would lead to positive behavior since it would give ANYONE ( buyer/seller/3rd party ) the opportunity to throw some more coin into the pot to pay for better service. \r\n\r\nHow feasible this would be, no clue.
