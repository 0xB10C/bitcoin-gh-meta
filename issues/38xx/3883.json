   "body" : "Rebased version of [#3354](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3354).\r\n\r\nInstead of dropping double-spend transactions, relay them to peers.  This is crucial to allowing all parts of the network to detect double-spend attempts as quickly as possible, i.e. reducing the \"confirmation\" time for buying coffee to a time on par with credit card transactions.  Only the first respend seen is relayed.\r\n\r\nI successfully completed a primary test running 3 copies of bitcoin-qt in regtest mode with this patch applied, connected in a **node1-newtorknode-node2** configuration.\r\n\r\nI used the rawtransaction API for steps 2 and 3, but with -salvagewallet and a single funding transaction, tests would be possible that did not require rawtransactions.\r\n\r\nStill TODO: Regression test plan\r\n\r\nPrimary Test Details\r\nStep 1\r\n- Send transaction from node1 to a node2 address\r\n* * Transaction **is relayed** through networknode, to node2\r\n* * Transaction appears in node2 wallet\r\n\r\nStep 2\r\n- Restart node1 with -salvagewallet (so it forgets about 1st spend)\r\n- Send new transaction using same input (first double-spend), using rawtransaction API\r\n* * Transaction **is relayed** through networknode, to node2\r\n* * node2 does not accept the double-spend into its mempool and it does not appear in node2 wallet\r\n\r\nStep 3\r\n- Restart node1 with -salvagewallet again\r\n- Send transaction using same input (second double spend), using rawtransaction API\r\n* * Transaction **is not relayed** through networknode\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nOne more test for good measure\r\n- Restart node1 with -salvagewallet again\r\n- Using regular UI (not rawtransaction API), send entire wallet balance to node2 (third double spend).  This included additional inputs besides the spent one.\r\n* * Transaction **is not relayed** through networknode\r\n",
