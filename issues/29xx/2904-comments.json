      "body" : "So, the design choices here were to reuse or prompt when the keypool ran dry.  Reuse has the advantage that the behavior would never change even when the pool empties, but it would reuse a previously assigned address, which is really surprising.  There would also be an option to reuse after prompting if the wallet didn't unlock. \r\n\r\nCodeshark, said prompt on empty. I agree. If someone wants to reuse when they don't have the keyÃ¢ÂÂ the list is there.\r\n\r\nI tested this by starting up with an encrypted wallet and hitting new address until the keypool ran out and it promoted me. I dismissed the dialog and retried a few times before finally letting it unlock and confirming it worked as expected.",
