I can squash down before merge, but I decided to push individual changes in case anyone is following the progress.\r\n\r\nFully verified on osx now that my macbook is up and running again (yay!).\r\n\r\nI also scrapped the 'windows-deploy' target and replaced it with the generic 'deploy' one. 'make deploy' on osx will produce a fully-functional dmg. When building for windows, 'make deploy' will create a fully-functional win32 installer.\r\n\r\nAt this point, it's feeling very very solid. That said, I only have osx 10.6 at my disposal currently, so it hasn't been tested on 10.7/10.8 yet.\r\n\r\n@fanquake: Tested extensively with macports and homebrew after today's changes. The build procedure is pretty much: install macports/homebrew depends as before, but with automake/autoconf added. Additionally, you can install qt directly from macports/homebrew and it should just work (tm). After that, standard configure+make should be all it takes.\r\n\r\nI'll try to get the osx docs written+pushed tomorrow.",

The point of autotools is abstraction, so there's really no need for platform-specific instructions. There's also really no need for distinction between qt/non-qt builds anymore.\r\n\r\nMy intention is essentially:\r\n- Platform-specific dependencies. A readme for each platform detailing what needs to be done before ./autogen.sh. Basically documenting the part you just went through.\r\n- Building bitcoin. How to bootstrap and configure. See ./configure --help for options. Pitfalls. What do I do when X?\r\n- Distribution notes. How to package, release, etc.\r\n- Testing. \r\n\r\nThe problem with the above is that I need a good bit of feedback. I've been looking at this (and working on other autotools projects) for so long that it's become hard to tell what's non-obvious. I don't think I'll receive much feedback until it's merged and there are more devs exposing its warts.\r\n\r\nSo my proposal is to do a quick readme with monkey-style copy/paste commands for the various platforms, and let that suffice until merge. Post-merge, the above outline could be much more easily worked out.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
