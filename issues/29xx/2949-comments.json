I was pretty confident with the raw transaction tools, and (until today) had created over 200 transactions without any issues.  Then while creating a raw transaction today, I accidentally included vout=0 when I intended to include vout=1 in the input.  The result was accidentally paying a fee of 3.78843458 BTC.  I had thought that I had calculated a fee of 0.0001 BTC (if I had used the intended vout).\r\n\r\nAny of the following would have prevented the issue:\r\nA hard coded sanity check of 1 BTC maxFee\r\nA bitcoin.conf entry of maxFee set by me before I started using raw transactions (I would have set it to 0.0003 BTC)\r\nAn \"intended fee\" parameter in any of createrawtransaction, signrawtransaction, or sendrawtransaction that I would have set to 0.0001 BTC which can be compared to the actual fee in the transaction.\r\n\r\nIssue reported at bitcointalk.org here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=295101.0;topicseen\r\n\r\nTransaction example can be seen here: https://blockchain.info/tx-index/89611419\r\n",
