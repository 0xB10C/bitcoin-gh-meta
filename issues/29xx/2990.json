System time is accurate to within 250ms of several stratum 2 / stratum 3 NTP servers.\r\n\r\n(Local NY timezone selected under windows control panel, hardware clock is NOT set to UTC because that's not how NT 6.1, 6.0, 5.1, 5.0, 4.0 or any version of windows handles such things)\r\n\r\nThis bug probably also affects other versions of windows as well.\r\n\r\nEdit @laanwj: renamed to make clear this is not a problem with timezone detection or windows",
