The block chain is only 11 GB and is only written once, and he complains about much larger usage.\r\n\r\nMy guess for the reason is that the chainstate database is continuously being updated, and in total a much larger amount of data is being written for this. Assuming the size of the virtual disk is large enough, then depending on the file system, the data may end up scattered over the virtual block device, making every sector dirty and require space.",
