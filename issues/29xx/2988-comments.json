A good example is OSX, which is currently (as it was before) vastly different between debug/release builds, meaning that devs rarely see what end users will see.\r\n\r\nStopgap is just to put the old behavior back rather than having fishy builds in the meantime.",

I was hoping to bite this off in different chunks, but I suppose it's better worth doing as a whole.\r\n\r\nOSX is currently back-compat to 10.5. As you've mentioned, this should change to 10.6. Unfortunately, 10.6 still supports 32bit cpus, so release builds will need to remain 32bit. And in that case, debug should be 32bit as well.\r\n\r\nSo that means that the following move from release flags to always-on flags:\r\n-mmacosx-version-min=10.5 -arch i386 -> -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -arch i386\r\n\r\nAdditionally, osx has historically built with -O3 for release. For the sake of consistency, I'd prefer to move all release to -O2 or -O3 (no preference which).\r\n",

That means that every dev is targeting different architectures and sdks with their builds, meaning that the release binary will be completely different (read: different compiler, min sdk, target sdk, and architecture) than what devs have tested. That is a huge amount of trust to be putting into toolchains and compliant code, doubly so given Apple's whimsical replace-the-build-stack-for-each-release nature.\r\n\r\nIf the reason for not building with the release-platform by default is because it's too inconvenient for devs to be bothered, then in my opinion the correct question to ask is: should we support that platform? If so, then I think it's crucial for devs to be targetting it, otherwise it would be a stretch to call it supported.\r\n\r\nFor a bit of perspective, this would be equivalent to most devs working on win7/win8 building for native 64bit with msvc++ and backwards compatibility off, but releasing relatively untested 32bit binaries built by mingw in XP.\r\n\r\nI realize that our hand is somewhat forced with compilers, but I think we should mitigate as much as possible with regards to arch and sdk.",

Use the autotools default.\r\n\r\n1) Scrap the concept of \"debug version\" or \"release version\" entirely.\r\n2) Stop messing around with non-standard \"--enable-debug\" flags.  The standard is to provide anything *not already provided by default* via environment variables passed at configure time: CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LIBS, LDFLAGS, ...\r\n3) Stop messing around with -O2 in configure.ac, and just go with the default.\r\n4) Only modify flags when *required*, such as in the hardening case (an obvious exception to case 3).\r\n\r\n",
