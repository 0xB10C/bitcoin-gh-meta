Sorry for all the simple questions, but I'm really curious about how this class works and where the corruption happened.\r\n\r\nI used Fairdell HxCmp to do a byte comparison of   2 known good encrypted wallets and  then I compared a good encrypted wallet to my bad encrypted wallet.\r\n\r\nStart at offset 4200,   the bad wallet is all 00 00 00    the good wallet has data at this location.  The 2 good wallets have data at this location as can be seen in Image #1 of the photo Album located below.  \r\n\r\nData starts to re-appear again at offset 6000.   I'm not sure if any of this helps to make sense of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Photo Album can be found here.   http://imgur.com/a/DhC8Z#0",
