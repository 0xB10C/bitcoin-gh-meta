More importantly, \"getmemorypool(&lt;data&gt;)\" doesn't provide any way to communicate the reason for rejections. During BIP discussion, some developers expressed interest in keeping the JSON-RPC protocol HTTP-independent, and abusing HTTP headers like getwork does violates this.\r\n\r\nThere is also a need for passing \"features supported\" from clients to getmemorypool() so that clients can opt to not implement \"noncerange\" and inform the server on their support (or lack thereof) of other features (so it might possibly optimize its own processes based on that). So far, nobody has come up with a backward-compatible way to do this; perhaps it would be desirable to ignore non-string <data>, so that a future draft can turn it into an options Object?",

      "body" : "@sipa Hope this addresses everything:\n\n1) Servers are not required to have access to the transaction database, and miners may wish to include transactions that have not been relayed on the main network.\n2) The \"submit/hash\" mutation allows miners to replace actual transaction data with a reference, for servers which support this. The pull-request here does not support this functionality, since it is unlikely to be needed in bitcoind (solo miners and downstream pool servers are probably always going to be local and without bandwidth concerns); there are also mutations which servers can opt to use to allow miners to omit the transaction list entirely when it hasn't been modified, effectively reducing the bandwidth requirements to the same as getwork\n3) Your suggestion for a list of required coinbase outputs would involve specifying a format for that list, and actually increases the complexity since the same thing is expressed by what is effectively a boolean right now. I see the benefit of doing it that way, to allow miners to claim fees of transactions they add themselves - but what if a pool doesn't want to allow that?\n4) With restricted coinbase input, it is possible for servers to implement BIP 22 in the same way as they currently use getwork, but allowing miners to still audit the block they are working on.\n5) Clients are not required to support noncerange limiting, so the added complexity is itself optional\n6) \"time/\\*\" can usually in practice be ignored, since it is implied if the min/max are provided; it is listed so it is clear the time can be changed, and so servers might have a defined way to express \"change the time to anything you want\" - it's specified explicitly by bitcoind since there is no practical upper limit to the time miners can send it.\n7) The use case for adding transactions is... so miners can add other transactions. Kinda half the point of decentralized mining IMO. :p\n8) I don't mind removing \"transactions/remove\", but I'd rather just note it as being always implied to express that it can be done explicitly\n9) \"prevblock\" mutation is for the scenario where the miner has validated a new block before the server\n10) the \"required\" key on transaction objects is necessary for the flexibility of pools negotiating contracts for transaction acceptance, but \"txrequired\" allows saving a lot of bandwidth; I agree the mutation should be implicit given these two other methods\n11) \"mintime\" and \"maxtime\" are needed in addition to their \"\\*off\" versions, for servers such as bitcoind which only care about the network rules; in this case, \"mintime\" is a fixed time, not related to the current time at all.\n12) \"target\" is needed to allow shares of varying sizes; pools *do* make use of this\n13) \"workid\" is needed to allow the server to identify which work issued the block is being submitted against, so it can properly validate the share\n14) Transaction objects must include sigop count, as there is no way for dumb miners to calculate it thanks to BIP16\n",

One practical superiority of decentralized mining is that miners are restored the freedom to choose their own minimum fee policies - that requires being able to pick and choose transactions that go into their blocks. At the same time, pools negotiating bulk fees has been an accepted \"plan\" for a while, and BIP22 can support that also.\n\nI will try to expand on the Motivation section.",
