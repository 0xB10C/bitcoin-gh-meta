I checked the ts-files, they got updated and now contain the missing strings I mentioned before + have the correct line reference to the source file.\r\n\r\nThere are only 2 strings which fall back to state unfinished, as they were changed in the source. These will need a re-translation. 8 new strings are in the ts-files, which then need a translation.\r\n\r\nThe updated ts-files would need to be pushed to Transifex, but I'm not sure if I can or are allowed to do this?",
