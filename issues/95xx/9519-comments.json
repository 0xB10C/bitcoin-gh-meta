So if that number drops significantly it'll be worth revisiting.  Beyond that, it shouldn't matter if a bunch of high fee txs aren't tracked as long as enough still are to give you the data you need.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr sigh...  sure, estimates should be magical and give you perfect answers.  But whether this is the optimal algorithm is not the question here.  The question is whether this is a reasonable improvement and I believe it is.",

In the worst case situation this can lead fee estimation to think that all transactions of that fee rate would take longer to be confirmed.  \r\n\r\n If you know that some miners are not considering a certain subset of transactions for block inclusion, its better to eliminate those as potential data points for fee estimation.  There are two opposing arguments to this:\r\n1. You've eliminated so many transactions that you don't have a big enough sample of data points. (Not a concern here)\r\n2. What if the particular transaction you are placing is of the type that is chosen to be excluded for fee estimation because its disadvantaged.  This is a reason to not overly narrow the policy profile required for fee estimation.  But in the case of replacement transactions, I think its relatively well known that not all miners might accept your replacement, and in the case they don't, the alternative is your original transaction is still mined, so its probably ok if fee estimates are maybe not perfectly tailored to your particular transaction.",

But if they do, I don't think we should special-case our code in it.\r\n\r\nEspecially if we want to generate RBF transactions ourselves later it looks like something that will come back to bite us.\r\n\r\n> Do we have any data/estimates on widespread RBF policy usage [by miners]?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see this too.",

In our case there certainly isn't enough data now to give an answer for replacements on their own, so we might as well exclude replacements from the regular transaction data so we are giving an unpolluted answer for regular transactions at least.\r\n\r\nIn other words its no harm done if they aren't really subject to different policy.
