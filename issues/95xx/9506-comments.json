I introduced a bug recently as a result of carelessness which was exacerbated by our coding style on this front. \r\n\r\nWith respect to the one line without braces rule, we should find out if clang format can implement this policy.  I see that it can allow one line, but I think it might still require braces there if they're required everywhere else.   \r\n\r\nAlso it would be good to work this out before we do any big boost migrations, since there may be changes to fix some of these at the same time.",
