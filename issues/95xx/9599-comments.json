Is there any advantage in this blocking?\r\n\r\nUpon further thought, I don't think this is a concern, as this PR only affects during IBD and not when the chain is synced, so the behaviour is the same, but just means that ping times are not affected (as they are currently) and the block download no longer freezes during IBD.\r\n\r\nBut if during IBD you did want to re-inforce behaviour, you could simply postpone responding to getblocks and getheader requests while fActivateChain is true - what would be the benefit in doing this though?",
