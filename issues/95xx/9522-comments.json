So perhaps we should just assume the segwit deserialization if a transaction can be decoded both ways (not perfect, but the best we can do for now, I think), and otherwise allow for 0-input transactions?\r\n\r\nSpecifically: I think we can leave the existing call to DecodeHexTx unchanged (ie, pass in `true` as the last argument), and then add an additional check that, if mtx is a 0-input transaction, try to decode again with that last boolean set to `false` (to force segwit deserialization), and if it succeeds, prefer the segwit deserialization over the 0-input one.\r\n\r\nWe should document this behavior as well...",
