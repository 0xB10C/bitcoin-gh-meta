Unused imports is one class of violations covered by `pycodestyle`.\r\n\r\nI've done some cleanup work for the `apple/swift` project - [see here](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20author%3Apracticalswift%20is%3Amerged) - which included things such as bringing the Python code base in line with PEP-8. Please let me know if that kind of contributions would be welcome in the Bitcoin project and I'll dig in! :-)",
