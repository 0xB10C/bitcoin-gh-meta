This is an ancient todo of mine.\r\n\r\nTo match the osx signing procedure, pack the needed ingredients into the unsigned tarball. This makes the signing procedure very straightforward.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the cert chain has been added so that the signer doesn't provide it, only the private key for the codesigning cert.. Note that the gitian recipe for re-attaching the signature does not actually verify this yet, though.\r\n\r\nAlso added some quick docs for the procedure.",
