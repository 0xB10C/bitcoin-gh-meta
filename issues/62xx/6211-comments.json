I maintain that the c++11 constructs (auto, uniform initialization, move semantics and rvalue references, variadic templates, lambdas, range-based-for, etc) bleed into eachother, so trying to set boundaries would get nasty and very confusing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that the move is important, so I'm willing to concede that point if necessary.\r\n\r\nI think it's also worth considering making libbitcoinconsensus able to compile without c++11, but I could go either way on that.",
