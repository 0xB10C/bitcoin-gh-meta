Description:\r\n\r\nIf no username and password are provided through the conf file or command line and no conf file exists, one will be created and preconfigured with the username and password recommended in the original console message. The generated username and password will be set in memory too, so the RPC server is immediately accessible with these details.\r\n\r\nIf a conf file does exists but does not contain a username and password, the old error will show, as I felt it too forward to start modifying a user's existing conf file without their consent.\r\n\r\nFirst attempt to contribute, please don't bite my head off.",
