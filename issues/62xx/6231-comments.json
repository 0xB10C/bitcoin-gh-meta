I assume they are just not bothering to set a custom limit.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if we are currently using 400kb, and the number of transactions continue to increase at the current rate, it won't be long before that number increases, and it's going to take a while for miners to get up to date so I feel it's better to increase it a bit now, while we wait for consesus around the 'hard' block size limit increase, or other viable solutions to scalability to come along.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that the data Luke has used removes 'Microtransactions' and transaction which Luke has classified as 'Inefficient/data use of the blockchain', but nevertheless are still occurring.
