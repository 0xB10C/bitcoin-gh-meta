Even before the min relay fee was reduced to 1000sat, transactions with small fees were effectively relayed anyway (they were subject to a rate limiter that hardly ever kicked in).  But with changes to 0.10, low priority transactions now are not relayed at all if they don't meet the min relay fee.\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear to me that it makes sense to change the mining minimum.  There isn't an issue as long as the mining minimum is below the relay minimum right?\r\n",

The last time this default was discussed, it was decided on the amount restored here. The details you describe as relevant are for *changes*. I guess if we want to open a conversation about changing it, that's fine, but I thought the same factors leading to this default have remained the same. Looking at price graphs, I see I am wrong: price has risen 5x since 2013 Mar. So maybe instead of restoring the default here, we should change to 0.00002 BTC? Maybe not worth the time to discuss, at that small a difference, though. Either way, this probably is the wrong place for discussing a change, so I'm closing this.",

A single dev shouldn't have that power\r\n\r\nThat's not a very good argument - as one could say the same about bitcoin core's devs. Then it's up to the user to specify their own `-minrelaytxfee` they are comfortable with. The only requirement on the default is that it's not broken or harmful. I've reopened this issue because there was some talk that this may be the case. \r\n\r\nMy own nodes are working fine, but were reporting  ~50MB for the mempool size which indicates spamming is possible (and if there is no upper bound, that is bad). Using -minrelaytxfee=0.00005 brought this down to ~5MB.\r\n\r\nOf course this would not be a permanent fix hence 'temporary workaround'. At least for 0.12 we should aim to have proper mempool limiting, discarding transactions based on relative criteria instead of hardcoded absolute limits.\r\n",

If we're allowing (by policy) low value and low fee transactions to relay, then it is easy to spam.  This PR would require the feerate to be 10x higher.  I'm suggesting that the feerate only need to be higher for low priority transactions, as that should be just as effective in preventing spam but allow a few more use cases through for low fee transactions.  That is what would happen by default with this PR, except those transactions though now relayed, would be prioritized for mining by their priority instead of their fee and would only be allowed in a priority section of a block if it exists.  I'm suggesting to allow them in the fee section provided they still have some fee.\r\n",
