Even before the min relay fee was reduced to 1000sat, transactions with small fees were effectively relayed anyway (they were subject to a rate limiter that hardly ever kicked in).  But with changes to 0.10, low priority transactions now are not relayed at all if they don't meet the min relay fee.\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear to me that it makes sense to change the mining minimum.  There isn't an issue as long as the mining minimum is below the relay minimum right?\r\n",
