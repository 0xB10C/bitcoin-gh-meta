I was against statically linking Qt first as well (because of the desktop integration problems), see discussion in #4284, but was eventually convinced because all the other options are even worse.\r\n\r\nGist of the matter is, that there is no good way to distribute portable GUI executables on Linux. Blame the weird ecosystem. Also now that libstdc++ is linked statically (another compatibility compromise, #5819) there is no other option than to link all c++ libraries as static.\r\n\r\nUpgrading the static Qt version is fine with me, if that helps anything. Should be straightforward - see `depends/packages/qt.mk`.\r\n",
