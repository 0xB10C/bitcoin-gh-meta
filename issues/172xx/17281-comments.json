Leave them out to avoid confusion.\n \n+- Use `.c_str()` sparingly. Its only valid use is to pass C++ strings to C functions that take NULL-terminated\n+  strings.\n+\n+  - Do not use it when passing a sized array (so along with `.size()`). Use `.data()` instead to get a pointer\n+    to the raw data.\n+\n+    - *Rationale*: This can be dangerous, as the part of the data after the first NULL character is not guaranteed\n+    to be initialized at all. Also, `.data()` communicates the intent better.\n+\n+  - Do not use it when passing strings to `tfm::format`, `strprintf`, `LogPrint[f]`.\n+\n+    - *Rationale*: This is redundant. Tinyformat handles strings.\n+\n+  - Do not use it to convert to `QString`.
