I would expect assets to just use coloured coins...\r\n\r\nTwo reasons: first, colored coins can only perform explicit transactions, such as sends of assets from one address to another.  They cannot support *implicit* actions, like sending an asset from a recipient in response to a single transaction from a sender (this would include crowdsale/ICO-like functionality as well as decentralized exchange capability).  Second, colored coins using a particular number of satoshis in an output as an identifier are always at risk of being inadvertently destroyed by non-compliant clients/wallets that receive them and don't recognize the importance of that output being preserved.",
