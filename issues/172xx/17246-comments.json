Instead of passing along subtractFeeFromOutputs to BnB, I think it makes more sense to just change the effective_values of each input to be nValue and change the non_input_fees to 0, BnB doesn't need to know whether subtractFeeFromOutputs is being used.\r\n\r\nI can work on this as an alternative if you'd like.",

It should try to find a set of coins as close to the target as possible, minizing the fees subtracted from the output. With regular wallets this doesn't matter much, but if you have to choose between spending a P2WPK coin or some 15-of-15 multisig it does.",
