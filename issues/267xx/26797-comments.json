If you are not mining then you generally don't want to have `-mintxfee` set much differently than what the wider network is using for `-minrelaytxfee` (and that miners are using for `-blockmintxfee`).\r\n\r\nIf something like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933 is merged, then this even extends to packages too.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I somewhat agree that setting the feerate to `0` should not cause the program to exit.",
