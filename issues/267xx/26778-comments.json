I saw #[22235](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22235) was merged on May 4th, but I am working on a download of bitcoin core from yesterday, so my download should be completely up to date. I ran your code.\r\n\r\nIn:\r\n`% contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh`\r\n\r\nOut:\r\n```\r\nfatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\r\n/src/bitcoind not found or not executable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoving forward: \r\n1) I think it makes more sense to have `bitcoin.conf` in the main repository rather than being buried deep in the `share/examples/` directory because burying it would make it difficult to call and add complexity; and\r\n2) It probably makes sense to focus on a solution to the core pathing problem, rather than doing a work around.\r\n",

The macOS Build Guide says it could take days to download the blockchain, but I have already completed this download. However, I downloaded Bitcoin Core earlier this year and have the GUI from the [Bitcoin Core Website](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/). It is located in my `Applications` folder, but I have yet to find a way to access it from the terminal or interact with the underlying software. \r\n\r\n1. Is it necessary to download the blockchain twice to make software contributions?\r\n2. What is the reason that the `Applications` folder appears empty through the terminal, but full of applications through the GUI?\r\n3. How do I access Bitcoin Core in the `Applications` folder for the purpose of software development?\r\n\r\n",
