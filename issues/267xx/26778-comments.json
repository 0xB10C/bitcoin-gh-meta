I saw #[22235](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22235) was merged on May 4th, but I am working on a download of bitcoin core from yesterday, so my download should be completely up to date. I ran your code.\r\n\r\nIn:\r\n`% contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh`\r\n\r\nOut:\r\n```\r\nfatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\r\n/src/bitcoind not found or not executable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoving forward: \r\n1) I think it makes more sense to have `bitcoin.conf` in the main repository rather than being buried deep in the `share/examples/` directory because burying it would make it difficult to call and add complexity; and\r\n2) It probably makes sense to focus on a solution to the core pathing problem, rather than doing a work around.\r\n",
