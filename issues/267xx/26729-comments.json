      "body" : "In 'kvB', 'v' stands for virtual. This notation was introduced with SegWit, where the block size limit was replaced with a four million weight unit limit, which introduced a new way to âcountâ transaction data; instead of transaction size, a new metric was defined, called âvirtual sizeâ (in this case virtual bytes). You can find a reference to virtual size in [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#transaction-size-calculations) and there is [a great explanation on stackexchange for how block weight works](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/67113/how-does-segwit-reduce-transaction-size-when-the-signature-is-simply-moved-to-a/67115#67115).\r\n\r\nYou can find a lot of references in the repository for `vbytes` as well as `BTC/kvB` and `sats/vB`. With a quick search it seems that it might be true that there is no easy to find explanation on what virtual bytes are.",
