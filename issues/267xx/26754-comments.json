It correlates (inversely) to the graph linked above.\r\n\r\nIt's been cut almost in half, in only a week, to about 24%, which is the lowest it's been in seven years. We consider anything below 20% to be dire. We of course have multiple layers of defenses to try to prevent congestion collapse but it could still happen.\r\n\r\nA couple things that would help us:\r\n\r\n- If you have an estimate of how many addresses per minute or hour a typical node is creating\r\n- If you know or can guess what downstream project in particular might have enabled transient addresses by default or made it easy for users to do so, (the graph below may provide clues) so that we may contact the devs\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nhttps://geti2p.net/_static/images/tunnel.buildExploratorySuccess.10m_31_0.png",
