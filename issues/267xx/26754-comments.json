Such nodes make only outbound connections.\r\n* It tries to maintain up to 10 outbound connections. Once they are established it would not attempt to make new ones.\r\n* For nodes that access other networks too, I2P is probably a small % of those 10 outbound. But for nodes accessing only I2P, then that is all 10 outbound connections.\r\n* With a high rate of failure to establish a connection, a node would keep trying to get to 10 outbound connections, making \"frequent\" attempts.\r\n\r\nI guess it makes sense to have a pool of transient addresses + a rate limit on how often entries from the pool are disposed. What would be a reasonable rate limit? Would it depend on the number of bitcoin nodes trying to establish I2P connections?\r\n\r\n> Limit to one tunnel each way with inbound.quantity=1 outbound.quantity=1\r\n\r\nDoes that mean max one outbound address at a time?\r\n\r\n> Reuse an address if the connection failed\r\n\r\nThat makes perfect sense!\r\n\r\n> If you have an estimate of how many addresses per minute or hour a typical node is creating\r\n\r\nFor the last week, my node made ~7 I2P connection attempts per day with ~5 of those attempts ending up with an error. That node is also accessing other networks. For an I2P-only node those numbers would be higher. For the same period that node made ~150 new outbound connections per day (~6 per hour, including to non-I2P addresses).\r\n\r\n> If bitcoin maintains 16 peer connection, then 160 tunnel build requests at least per 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nIt is max 10 peer connections (for the relevant case of transient addresses of a non listening node). It is 10 for I2P-only nodes, which I guess the majority are not. Where does the \"10 minutes\" come from?\r\n\r\nI will work on a patch to reuse the address if connection attempt fails, maybe also after connection is closed - aka pool of addresses.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "body" : "Thanks everyone for sharing here. Some quick info:\r\n\r\n- My node continuously runs all of the networks supported by Bitcoin Core: IPv4, IPv6, Tor, I2P, and CJDNS, all with listening on and no settings to throttle bandwidth.  It generally has only 2 outbound I2P peers, if even that many, out of the possible 10, and those are often manual rather than automatic connections. OTOH, it usually has 10-20 inbound I2P peers and these tend to be stable connections.\r\n\r\n-  Running `-addrinfo` shows that my node is aware of only a couple hundred I2P peers on the network at this time. Of those, I'm not sure how many run v24 and changed the default behavior of I2P listening on (it is possible that very few node operators are aware of the transient I2P addresses added in v24).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli -rpcwait -addrinfo\r\n{\r\n  \"addresses_known\": {\r\n    \"ipv4\": 46047,\r\n    \"ipv6\": 10580,\r\n    \"onion\": 11913,\r\n    \"i2p\": 238,\r\n    \"cjdns\": 3,\r\n    \"total\": 68781\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- A theoretical maximum number of outbound I2P connections for a node that only connects using I2P would be 10-11 automatic, and up to 8 additional manual ones if the user specifies that many. Note, however, that using only I2P with Bitcoin Core is not a good idea for the reasons given in https://jonatack.github.io/articles/using-alternative-p2p-networks-with-bitcoin-core (sybil/eclipse, network partitioning, and slow IBD). These are also partly discussed in `doc/i2p.md`.\r\n   \r\n> One of our users @Tracachang did some testing, and reported only 4 I2P connections with Tor enabled, and 9 with onlynet=i2p. That's less than I would have guessed and on its face shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nYes, those sound about right.\r\n\r\n> I will work on a patch to reuse the address if connection attempt fails, maybe also after connection is closed - aka pool of addresses.\r\n\r\nSGTM.\r\n\r\n> In the meantime, please update your i2p doc to discourage the transient option.\r\nAlso in that doc, in the bandwidth section at the bottom, please encourage people to share as much bandwidth and transittunnels as they can, to increase their anonymity with the cover traffic, and so that bitcoin users contribute more to the i2p network than they consume. If a popular application uses more network resources than it contributes, it has the potential to take down the entire network.\r\n\r\nThat's fair. I'll work on your documentation suggestions.",
