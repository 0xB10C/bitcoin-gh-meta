However, I was curious about one change that has been done here.\r\n\r\n> Responds with 404 if block height is out of range.\r\n\r\nI googled for the error code's meaning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**404:** an error message displayed by a browser indicating that an internet address cannot be found\r\n**400:** Bad Request response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiving an out-of-range block height is more of a **bad request** than a **cannot found** error, won't you think?\r\nAgain, I am not talking about this PR per se, but in general about returning 404 for out-of-range block height.\r\n",
