However, I was curious about one change that has been done here.\r\n\r\n> Responds with 404 if block height is out of range.\r\n\r\nI googled for the error code's meaning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**404:** an error message displayed by a browser indicating that an internet address cannot be found\r\n**400:** Bad Request response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiving an out-of-range block height is more of a **bad request** than a **cannot found** error, won't you think?\r\nAgain, I am not talking about this PR per se, but in general about returning 404 for out-of-range block height.\r\n",

When you pass a valid block height but it wasn't able to find it, it means 404, because your request is valid but the server wasn't able to find the requested resource (e.g. your node can be out of date).\r\nHowever, if you pass an invalid block height like: 'abc', 'dksaodka', '3j213j1k13j', the server won't be able to process it, so, it should return 500 or 400.\r\n\r\n@shaavan \r\n",
