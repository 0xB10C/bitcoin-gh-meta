      "body" : "@MarcoFalke: Fair points, though I would counter the general \"will make tests harder to read and understand\" argument with the fact that for the vast majority of tests the origin of a tx is not relevant at all, as we just want to fill the mempools of all nodes (in the rare cases where different mempool- or policy-related settings are used, or the nodes are not all connected, `from_node` could still be passed explicitly). In a personal experience it feels odd to already need to pass a specific node on the MiniWallet instance but then still having to pass `from_node` again and again for trivial tests.\r\n\r\nAs a possibly less controversial suggestion, would it at least make sense to introduce the default parameter for `create_self_transfer`? The node parameter is only used for the `testmempoolaccept` RPC and the tx is not sent yet, i.e. using `self._test_node` as default for that purpose seems to be fine. `send_self_transfer` and `send_to` would of course still call `create_self_transfer` with the still mandatory `from_node` argument.",

Not sure how successful such a patch would be, considering that https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23300 took two years (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20362). But overall we should be moving into that direction, given that racy tests will inevitably lead to bugs (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22437#discussion_r779593489).\r\n\r\n> less controversial\r\n\r\nYeah, should be uncontroversial",
