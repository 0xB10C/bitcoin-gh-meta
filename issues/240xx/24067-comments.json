You'd also have to check nSequence to find non-final txs.\r\n\r\n> GUI, the current intended behaviour tells more information\r\n\r\nFixing this for the GUI will open up trivial DoS vectors for no benefit. To check for nSequence timelocks, the whole utxo set + mempool needs to be scanned for each input for each unconfirmed wallet transaction.\r\nIt is already impossible to use a wallet for large tx counts (#16815, #15148, #7475), so I don't see why we should make that even worse for a feature that has no practical benefit.\r\nIt is currently not possible to add non-final txs to a wallet, since all wallet txs are added either via the chain, via the mempool, or via the internal wallet itself. In all three cases we know the txs to be final. So for a wallet tx to change to the non-final state, one needs to do a reindex/reorg, in which case the tx will be final once the reindex/reorg has finished. (Unless someone is doing a malicious, potentially large reorg, in which case a mouse-over string in a details window of the GUI should be the least of your problems. In fact you wouldn't be able to trust it anyway due to the malicious hashrate.)\r\nAnd for the reindex you can already see when the tx was added to the wallet. As you know it was final at the time it was added, adding a string (Open for %n blocks) is just redundant. For example, if your reindex is currently at year 2015 and there is a tx locked to a block height in 2019, adding a string (open for 123123 blocks) doesn't help the user at all. The user can already tell that 2019 is ahead in the reindex process, which is at 2015.\r\n\r\n> The second issue seems like a strict bugfix, so should get merged faster/cleaner.\r\n\r\nOverall I don't understand why a questionable feature in the GUI is used as an argument against a patch that is:\r\n* a bugfix\r\n* only removes code\r\n* speeds up the wallet/gui",
