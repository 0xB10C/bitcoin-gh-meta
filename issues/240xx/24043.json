   "body" : "This adds a new `multi_a(k,key_1,key_2,...,key_n)` descriptor for k-of-n policies inside `tr()`. Semantically it is very similar to the existing `multi()` descriptor, but with the following changes:\r\n* The corresponding script is `<key1> OP_CHECKSIG <key2> OP_CHECKSIGADD <key3> OP_CHECKSIGADD ... <key_n> OP_CHECKSIGADD <k> OP_NUMEQUAL`, rather than the traditional `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`-based script, making it usable inside the `tr()` descriptor.\r\n* The keys can optionally be specified in x-only notation.\r\n* Both the number of keys and the threshold can be as high as 512. This number is rather arbitrary (over 11000 can probably work fine in some settings), but I wanted some limit to the length of the descriptors. Bikeshedding welcome.\r\n\r\nI expect that this functionality will later be replaced with a miniscript-based implementation, but I don't think it's necessary to wait for that.\r\n",
