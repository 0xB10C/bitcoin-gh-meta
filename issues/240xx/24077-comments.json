      "body" : "The problem with having more tests, say for `base_uint<512>`, is that whenever you call `GetHex()` or `SetHex()` on it, you'll get undefined reference because the template `base_uint<512>` is not instantiated. I don't really want to do that in the interest of keeping this PR simple because this can easily turn to a monstrosity, especially that I don't like the way the instantiations for arith_uint256 are being done... I did instantiations of templates before by class, and not by method. I don't know why it's done like this (maybe some compilers don't like it?). Let's find out.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of being helpful, I'll add a commit that fixes this... let's see if I'll get yelled at by CI.\r\n\r\nIf that works, you guys can tell me whether you'll tolerate the presence of `base_uint<512>` instantiation just to test this (?).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a static assert may be appropriate, but I can't see a place to put it. If anyone can think of something, please recommend it. ",
