If they're and their usages is high enough to lead to a significant rate of witness conflicts, by that time I would expect this new replacement policy to be widely deployed in the miner ecosystem.\r\n\r\nOf course, the majority of miners might run a different policy than the default Core's one. Though, until the contrary is corroborated by periodic probing of miner's mempools, I think we can reasonably hold the assumption they're.\r\n\r\nSo to simplify, I lean to account witness replacement in fee estimation as early as this PR.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think ?",
