Additionally, users can take steps to keep from leaking information in a later transaction, e.g migrate the legacy UTXO to a newer output type (which on-chain would look like the UTXO was being spent to a bech32), before mixing it with other UTXOs to fund later transactions.\r\n\r\n> I am actually thinking right now that recipient output type matching could be a lot more beneficial, if we preferentially built input sets for coin selection from a single type of UTXOs. The resulting input sets would probably also be more waste-effective than mixed input sets, as e.g. legacy input sets would be preferred at low feerates and more modern output types should be more attractive at higher feerates than mixed sets of the same input count.\r\n\r\nThis is the ideal scenario! We keep output matching for all types to preserve privacy _and_ we have coin selection avoid mixing different output types when selecting inputs and always prefer to get rid of older output types when possible.\r\n\r\nI've been working on this in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584 and would love feedback on the approach. This is better than not matching legacy addresses as it keeps the privacy improvements for all address types while also addressing concerns about later leaking information and concerns about creating new legacy UTXO's.\r\n\r\nConcept -0 on not matching change outputs for legacy, in favor of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584",

      "body" : "I've been thinking more about the proposed change here. I would argue that before #24584, matching output types mostly improved privacy temporarily for the time between a transaction was created and the change output was spent, as the circumstances in which the change was later spent would more often reveal that it was the change, e.g. when it got spent together with more modern outputs which would indicate that the other output probably was the cause for using legacy outputs. There might have been more of a benefit if the change was a solitary input on the next transaction. However, especially given that there are many other heuristics that also hint at the change output, it seemed a bit unreasonable to increase the future cost of spending the change output by a factor 2.17Ã for this tenuous privacy benefit.\r\n\r\nAfter #24584 our wallets are presumably achieving single-type input sets for most transactions, and this actually changes the benefit of matching legacy outputs more to a question of âprivacy vs costâ. Although other heuristics that allow recognizing change would still not be impacted (e.g. based on amounts, or general wallet fingerprints matching between original and change transaction but not recipient transaction), but at least the legacy output is less likely to be mixed in with other outputs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is also a meta question of whether creating more legacy outputs helps sustain the acceptability of legacy use. Fewer legacy outputs on the network in general would also make matching legacy and then later spending legacy stick out more. Right now feerates are extremely low, so maybe the additional cost is currently worth the privacy benefit, but if the feerates go up significantly again, sitting on more legacy outputs would be more costlyâalthough they should get selected quickly at the current low feerates as well. And potential higher feerates in the future would prompt more people to switch to blockweight-efficient output types to lower their own future cost, which would reduce our creation of legacy outputs in turn then.\r\n\r\nSo, perhaps we don't need to get active at this time and remove matching of legacy outputs now. Most of the downsides will fix themselves in the long run anyway, and at current feerates the cost is likely low anyway.\r\n\r\nI.e. code looks good to me, I could see the argument go either way for various reasons.",

The user is sending Bitcoin to an address given to them by the recipient - they have no control over that address type. However the user may want to use segwit or taproot because those types are cheaper when spending. In a scenario where the user is trying to optimize for least fees (which many users do), it is actually not okay to send to change to legacy because that will incur higher fees in the future.\r\n\r\n> This affects privacy and makes no sense.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is not the end all be all of wallet design. Bitcoin Core's wallet is not a privacy focused wallet - we do not advertise as being private nor is privacy the primary focus. We try to encourage privacy and implement privacy improving behavior, but not to the detriment of other factors, such as cost to the user and effect on all the other nodes in the network. Given that legacy address types cost more to the user, cost more in block space, and can cost more to validate (in terms of CPU time), I think it is better for us to avoid making legacy outputs as much as possible, and that would include the contents of this PR. While it does have a negative impact on privacy, I do not think that the privacy gained from this behavior outweights the effects that continued legacy use has on everyone else.\r\n\r\nA potential alternative is to add an option that enables strict change type matching. Instead of removing this behavior entirely, it can be put behind a startup option or a transaction creation option so that users who do want the additional privacy can choose to enable it.",

We try to encourage privacy and implement privacy improving behavior, but not to the detriment of other factors, such as cost to the user and effect on all the other nodes in the network.  \r\n\r\nBitcoin Core may not be privacy focused in past. It all depends on users and reviewers.\r\n\r\n> Given that legacy address types cost more to the user, cost more in block space, and can cost more to validate (in terms of CPU time), I think it is better for us to avoid making legacy outputs as much as possible, and that would include the contents of this PR.\r\n\r\nUsers can decide if they want to use legacy or other addresses in that case if they have a choice. \r\n\r\n> While it does have a negative impact on privacy, I do not think that the privacy gained from this behavior outweights the effects that continued legacy use has on everyone else.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is either by default or nothing. Leaving loopholes for chain analysis firms to make algos based on these PRs does not make sense.",

And potential higher feerates in the future would prompt more people to switch to blockweight-efficient output types to lower their own future cost, which would reduce our creation of legacy outputs in turn then.\r\n> \r\n> So, perhaps we don't need to get active at this time and remove matching of legacy outputs now. Most of the downsides will fix themselves in the long run anyway, and at current feerates the cost is likely low anyway.\r\n\r\nThis sums up my feelings on this. I'd add that high feerates is a future problem, whereas privacy is a current problem. Not saying that we shouldn't be optimizing for fees now, but rather saying that I'd prefer we improve privacy today with slight tradeoffs in efficiency vs solutions that improve efficiency today at the expensive of privacy.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning that there are often ways to intervene with inefficient UTXOs (e.g migrating legacy UTXOs to newer types manually in low fee periods, improved coin-selection algos that are fee and address type aware, etc), whereas damaging privacy on-chain is a permanent mistake.\r\n",
