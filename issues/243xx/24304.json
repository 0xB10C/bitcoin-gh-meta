   "body" : "Part of: #24303\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces:\r\n\r\n1. A `libbitcoinkernel` library linking in the minimal list of files necessary to use our consensus engine as-is.\r\n1. An example/demo `bitcoin-chainstate` executable using said library which can print out information about a datadir and take in new blocks on stdin.\r\n\r\nPlease read the commit messages for more details.\r\n\r\n#### You may ask: WTF?! Why is `index/*.cpp`, etc. being linked in to a consensus engine library?\r\n\r\nThis PR is meant only to capture the state of dependencies in our consensus engine as of right now. There are many things to decouple from consensus, which will be done in subsequent PRs. Listing the files out right now in `libbitcoinkernel_la_SOURCES` is purely to give us a clear picture of the task at hand, it is **not** to say that these dependencies _belongs_ in a consensus engine library in any way.\r\n\r\n### Help Needed\r\n\r\n1. Would it be appropriate to add a CI job that enables `--enable-experimental-util-chainstate`? This would help us make sure that \"any further coupling of our consensus engine with non-consensus modules will result in linker errors, preventing this project from becoming a sisyphean task of battling coupling regressions.\"\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n1. Clean up `bitcoin-chainstate.cpp`\r\n   It is quite ugly, with a lot of comments I've left for myself, I should clean it up to the best of my abilities (the ugliness of our init/shutdown might be the upper bound on cleanliness here...)",
