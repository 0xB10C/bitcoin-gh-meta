   "body" : "This is a RFC regarding adding a new *Activity window* in the UI, which allows to:\r\n - have activity history (truncated, etc);\r\n - pause or cancel tasks if supported individually;\r\n - have multiple progresses concurrently.\r\n\r\nIn terms of patch, `ShowProgress()` signal is removed everywhere and a RAII class is added along with some UI classes:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass Activity\r\n{\r\n    std::shared_ptr<ActivityData> const d;\r\npublic:\r\n    Activity(const std::string& title);\r\n    ~Activity();\r\n\r\n    void SetTitle(const std::string& title);\r\n    void SetProgress(int progress);\r\n};\r\n```\r\nConsider this the minimal interface for an activity. Some other ideas:\r\n - custom progress range (so the caller doesn't have to calculate percentage)\r\n - add something like `SetPause(bool)`, `IsPaused()`;\r\n - also `Cancel()` and `IsCancelled()`;\r\n - add something like `SetSource(string)` (for instance `SetSource(\"wallet1\")`).\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is thread safe. For now, I've also added a new menu item `Window` where I think we could add `Console` too (another discussion thou).\r\n\r\nPlease see the capture below.\r\n\r\n ![dec-05-2017 02-01-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3534524/33586256-6b06297e-d960-11e7-9ff4-58b91e1293f2.gif)\r\n",
