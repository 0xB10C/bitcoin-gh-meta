By defintion, if they're unspendable they're not part of the utxo, right?\r\nI don't quite get why, but changing the genesis block of regtest (ie using the custom regtest proposed in #8994 ) makes this function return unspendable utxos and thus make segwit.py fail.\r\nOr in other words, I don't quite get why the function never randomly returns an unspendable utxo and fails without #8994. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this doesn't make sense without #8994, but I don't see the point in adding new parameters to the function that aren't used for any test.\r\n\r\n> Also, callers assume this call always work, it should throw after the loop?\r\n\r\nYeah, that makes sense to me.\r\n",
