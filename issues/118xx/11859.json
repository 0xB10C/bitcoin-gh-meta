The window should restore to the same state as it was  at the moment of minimizing it into the tray.\r\n\r\nMay be related to issue #8225 \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the bug do following under Windows:\r\n* In Options->Window enable \"Minimize to the tray instead of the taskbar\"\r\n* Optionally enable \"Minimize on close\", too\r\n* Minimize the main window\r\n* Klick on the tray icon (or right click on the tray icon and select Show/Hide)\r\n\r\nThe main window's taskbar icon appears, but the window itself is not restored to its original size.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour: the window should appear.",
