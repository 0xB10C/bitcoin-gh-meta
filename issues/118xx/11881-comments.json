However, the python code used for the unit tests and the few scripts meant for users is rather condensed and hopefully not much refactored in the future. So by not touching them, they should keep their compatibility.\r\nNote that the loose scripts are not (regularly) tested on py2 nor py3, so just declaring that they no longer function with py2 isn't a huge improvement. (Or making them merly incompatible with py2 isn't a huge improvement either, imo). As long as they are not rewritten in a large-ish way, I don't see why we should change the dependency requirements...\r\n",
