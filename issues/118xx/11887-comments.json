We already store \"replaces_txid\" and \"replaced_by_txid\" values for bumpfee transactions. If we started assigning these values in general when adding new transactions that spend the same inputs as existing transactions, we could avoid double counting change outputs by not including change from transactions with a \"replaced_by\" property in the unconfirmed balance.",
