Then if `-regtest.maxmempool=100` is an explicit argument as well as `-maxmempool=200`, the explicit regtest one should take precedence IMO.\r\n\r\nThen following this logic, `-wallet` specified explicitly as an argument should be used on regtest and testnet as well, using `regtest.wallet` should only be necessary in the config file to save confusion",

      "body" : "Great. Thanks for tackling this @ajtowns. A few high-level suggestions:\r\n\r\n- I agree with @MeshCollider that the order of precedence should be Command Line > Config File network-specific > Config File default.\r\n- I think there shouldn't be network-specific command-line options (that's almost an implication of the above). I agree with MeshCollider that the user should call `bitcoind` with `-wallet`, not `-regtest.wallet` (side-note - choosing a wallet from the wrong network is perhaps less of a problem than you might assume, since `-wallet` is already kind of network-specific as it refers to the name of the wallet in the particular network directory).\r\n- as well as `NETWORK_ONLY`, perhaps we want a `DEFAULT_ONLY` for options that shouldn't be overriden in the network-specific config. Namely those options would be `-regtest` and `-testnet`. For example don't want the following pathological config file to be valid:\r\n```\r\ntestnet\r\n[testnet]\r\nregtest\r\n[regtest]\r\nnotestnet\r\nnoregtest\r\n```\r\n- taking this further, perhaps we should deprecate the use of `testnet` and `regtest` in the config file entirely, so you can only select the network by using a command-line option?\r\n- I've avoided nitting your code at this early point, but I'd point you at the developer notes here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md, specifically symbol naming.  Your new `ArgsManager` members should be prefixed `m_` for example.",

      "body" : "Okay, getting that behaviour requires marginally more invasive changes, but I think it's worth it (and they're not *that* invasive). New patch series accompanying this comment which:\r\n\r\n * has arg precedence being: command-line arguments, net-specific config file options, default config file options\r\n * will only use config file options for -addnode and -wallet if you're on mainnet or put them in the right [regtest] or [testnet] section or add a `regtest.` or `testnet.` prefix\r\n * only allows -testnet and -regtest to be specified in the default section or on the command line (ie, [regtest] testnet=1 silliness is silently ignored)\r\n * for single-value options, precedence is (a) last value specified on the command line, (b) first value specified in the network section of the config file, and finally (c) first value specified in the default section of the config file. the last vs first difference between cli and conf is weird, but matches current behaviour. the code would be slightly improved by making it consistent.\r\n\r\nI think that should behave pretty much as expected -- specifying things on the command line will always take effect, having a testnet specific config and just invoking \"bitcoind -conf=testnet.conf\" should work fine, having separate configs for mainnet, regtest and testnet in a single file with different options should work too.\r\n\r\nFrom the code side of things, I've made a bunch of changes:\r\n\r\n * I've dropped mapArgs, and split mapMultiArgs into mapOverrideArgs (for cli arguments are ForceSetArg) and mapConfigArgs (for config files)\r\n * I've listed the net-specific options explicitly in util.cpp rather than having each use of the options specify that they're net-specific; seems simpler and much more robust.\r\n * I've moved ChainNameFromCommandLine from chainparamsbase into util, so it can have more precise access to how -testnet/-regtest were specified\r\n * I've dropped the filename argument from ReadConfigFile and split most of the logic into ReadConfigStream, which makes it more unit-testable\r\n\r\nI've added some unit tests, but they're a bit basic; I haven't done a functional test either. (And it's still a bit early for detailed code style nits, though I've tried to make a token effort to avoid them :) )\r\n\r\nEdit: Oh, the previous pass is commit 907dd64994e945a30833200ce1131840b06c8ab7 at https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/tree/netconf-sections-v1 on the off chance someone wants to look at it.",
