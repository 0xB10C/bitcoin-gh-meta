Then if `-regtest.maxmempool=100` is an explicit argument as well as `-maxmempool=200`, the explicit regtest one should take precedence IMO.\r\n\r\nThen following this logic, `-wallet` specified explicitly as an argument should be used on regtest and testnet as well, using `regtest.wallet` should only be necessary in the config file to save confusion",

      "body" : "Great. Thanks for tackling this @ajtowns. A few high-level suggestions:\r\n\r\n- I agree with @MeshCollider that the order of precedence should be Command Line > Config File network-specific > Config File default.\r\n- I think there shouldn't be network-specific command-line options (that's almost an implication of the above). I agree with MeshCollider that the user should call `bitcoind` with `-wallet`, not `-regtest.wallet` (side-note - choosing a wallet from the wrong network is perhaps less of a problem than you might assume, since `-wallet` is already kind of network-specific as it refers to the name of the wallet in the particular network directory).\r\n- as well as `NETWORK_ONLY`, perhaps we want a `DEFAULT_ONLY` for options that shouldn't be overriden in the network-specific config. Namely those options would be `-regtest` and `-testnet`. For example don't want the following pathological config file to be valid:\r\n```\r\ntestnet\r\n[testnet]\r\nregtest\r\n[regtest]\r\nnotestnet\r\nnoregtest\r\n```\r\n- taking this further, perhaps we should deprecate the use of `testnet` and `regtest` in the config file entirely, so you can only select the network by using a command-line option?\r\n- I've avoided nitting your code at this early point, but I'd point you at the developer notes here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md, specifically symbol naming.  Your new `ArgsManager` members should be prefixed `m_` for example.",
