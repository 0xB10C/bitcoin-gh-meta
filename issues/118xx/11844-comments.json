Below that you need many more hacks to build as some functions are not present",

Ideally it would have one but really I wanted to make sure we could use the latest NDK (still on r14b because of 32bit archs failing on later versions) and upstream necessary changes where possible. Right now I'm in the process of refreshing to 0.16.1 and at least build the 64 bit arch with r17b",

Also, I checked the latest update in the one we use in bitcoin core master and still suffers from the tautological-constant-compare Error (in zmq depends). \r\n\r\nActually I think the actual issue there is that we are not passing through/overriding depends compile flags when we build depends libraries but we do set tautological-constant-compare as a warning when we build bitcoin core. If we were to pass through/override depends CFLAGS/CPPFLAGS then we wouldn't even need the ZMQ patch.",
