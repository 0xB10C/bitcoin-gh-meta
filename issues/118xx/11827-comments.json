I'd assume, it is expected that you'd want to sweep the funds if you import a private key.\r\n* Also note, that unlike your bank account, addresses don't have a balance. And in the general case where a transaction uses multiple coins as inputs, it will be impossible to determine the address where the funds came from.\r\n* Finally, for privacy reasons, you shouldn't reveal what is the change output.
