      "body" : "Bitcoin Core (bitcoin-qt and bitcoind) will never make transactions that you do not give permission to. There is no \"the address\"; your wallet does not have one singular address that it uses. The wallet contains multiple addresses (thousands, in fact, and constantly generates more). When you make a transaction, there will usually be change, and the change will be sent to a change address. That change address is part of your wallet. It is not a new transaction, it is another output of the transaction that you were making.\r\n\r\nThere are no address changes; no addresses ever change or are removed from your wallet. Again, there is no \"the address\" in your wallet that changes. You can see all of the addresses that you use in your wallet by going to File > Receiving Addresses.\r\n\r\nThat the wallet uses new addresses for every time you need an address is well known and documented.\r\n\r\nIn what way did you lose coins?",
