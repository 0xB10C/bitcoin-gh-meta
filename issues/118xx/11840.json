I'm trying to find a reliable way to reproduce.\r\n\r\nSteps to (sometimes???) reproduce on master 497d0e014:\r\n1. launch QT a fresh (testnet) wallet\r\n2. generate receive address\r\n3. navigate to Overview tab\r\n4. use another wallet to send funds\r\n5. notice the transaction appears in the list\r\n6. notice no popup notification appears\r\n\r\nI'm not getting them for `v0.15.1` anymore either.",
