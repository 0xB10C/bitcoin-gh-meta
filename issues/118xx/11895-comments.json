It loses the entire review thread and spams contributors with additional notifications.\r\n\r\nCan you close this and re-open the original PR? I think you may need to do the following:\r\n\r\n- `git reset --hard HEAD~`  (git won't let you re-open a PR if the branch has changed since it closed)\r\n- `git push -f`\r\n- reopen #11843 and close this\r\n- `git reset --hard 95108d7f1a82d9807abdbbf65959e4453d3a623c` (to get back to this commit)\r\n- `git push -f`\r\n\r\nThen address the feedback from Marco in that PR (change security-check.py to use python3 as well)",
