   "body" : "This is a feature request:\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to expose fees for the transactions in mempool? I beleive bitcoin-core must already have that information internally, so it might be enough to expose that info via RPC/RES API. \r\n\r\nThe use case is here: http://node.ispol.sk/#!/mempool\r\n\r\nRight now I have to fetch all inputs for new transactions received via zeromq and that means a lot of RPC/REST calls.  If that page is unresponsive, a tx with few hundred inputs must have hit the server. Having it exposed directly for transactions in the mempool would be very beneficial. Doing one RPC to get the fee for a tx in mempool vs doing RPC calls for every input and compute the fee from it is a big difference. I believe we do not see a lot of real-time mempool dump tools because of this now ...\r\n\r\nOne can use (or even QT could show real-time fees)  it to decide what is the best fee, as relying only on algorithms is not always enough. Seeing fees as they \"fly by\" certainly helps.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
