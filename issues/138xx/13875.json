As the original source comment for `unsigned int  nChainTx` says, that should last until the year 2030.\r\n \r\nWith SegWit the [worst case number](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/59501), of transactions per block is ~12195 so we might have to deal with this as early as 2024.\r\n\r\nGiven that it's a memory-only thing and we want to allow users many years to upgrade, I would suggest fixing this in v0.18 and back-porting it.",
