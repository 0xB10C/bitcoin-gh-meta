      "body" : "This is a documentation terminology issue. I was confused too.  We now have three terms for the same thing.  1. Address Book Sending tab uses \"Name.\"  2. Address Book Receiving tab uses \"Label.\"  3. Documentation Wiki and API method calls use \n\"account\"  to mean both.  The term \"Address Book\" does not appear anywhere on this page: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Accounts_explained \n\nWhile we're at it the \"Sending\" tab of Address Book confuses me every time I look at it, it implies a list of my accounts to use to send from, but it's actually a list of recipient addresses.  Maybe we should change Sending to say Contacts, and change Receiving to say My Accounts.  \n\nSuggestion: Change Address Book field names \"Name\" and \"Label\" to \"Account Name\" for consistency.  \n\nSuggest editing https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list to add hyperlinks for each occurrence of \"account\" to https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Accounts_explained\n\nAfter client field changes above, edit https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Accounts_explained to include language clarifying that the account API covers both tabs of the Address Book and the client separates them based on whether it has the private key.",
