This happens when Bitcoin Core uses more than one thread to analyse downloaded blocks (occurs more often when the height is higher - uses more threads then).\r\n\r\nExpencted Results:\r\nGUI and RPC server should still response to user inputs or at least should not lose connections to other Bitcoin peers.",
