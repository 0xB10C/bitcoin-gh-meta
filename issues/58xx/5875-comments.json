      "body" : "I don't know of a great answer to that question...  I have been separately working on creating a python p2p framework for testing, and I have a test coded up in that framework that exercises this code for blocks received on the network (I manually tested the -reindex case of reading blocks from disk).  If you'd like to take a look, you can see it in my repo at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sdaftuar/bitcoin/commit/9a013ed41fd07217675b78bbb55e13575f0bb4e1\r\n\r\nThe test is called accept-block-test.py (run it with \"--testbinary=path-to-bitcoind\", with and without the \"--whitelist\" argument, to cover both cases).\r\n\r\nI think the test itself is a reasonable length but it builds on a lot of code that is still a work in progress, so I'm not sure how useful this is as a reference.  But if you do take a look at this, I'd certainly welcome any feedback you have on the testing framework itself.",
