New txes and blocks visually fly from the received-from node to their lists.  A gaggle of txes bunches up and flies into a new block (I guess many would fly in from off-screen).  A reorg'ed block spits them back out.  Maybe little 1-pixel tx bullets and 3-pixel blocks fly from txes and blocks to each peer when they are advertised.\r\n\r\nRequires more node<->wallet communication but bitcoin core is suited for it.\r\n",
