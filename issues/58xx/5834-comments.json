Thanks everyone here for the suggestions.\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure how to proceed, so here is what I have discovered, perhaps everyone here can make suggestions about the best route forward.\r\n\r\n[Here's the gist of the program I used for testing](https://gist.github.com/dfletcher/e7ee74166ce9bd6bdd58). Edit: oh, right. don't forget to build using mingw with -mwindows flag.\r\n\r\nEdit2: Whoops my bad, Sleep takes milliseconds arg not seconds. Gist and table below updated, self exe is not always async. Thought that seemed funky. And really the \"s\" of the whole CreateProcess() column is because my code waits. We could change that behavior and be always async there.\r\n\r\n|                          | CreateProcess() | ShellExecute() | ::system() |\r\n| -------------------- |:--------------------:|:------------------:|:------------:|\r\n| **.bat script**      | n s                     | n a                   | p s           |\r\n| **self exe**         | n s                     | n a                   | p s           |\r\n| **pythonw.exe**  | n s                     | n a                   | p s            |\r\n| **python.exe**    | n s                     | n a                   | p s            |\r\n<sup>**Key**: p = popup, n = no popup, s = synchronous, a = asynchronous</sup>\r\n\r\nEach method has own strengths and weaknesses.\r\n\r\n### CreateProcess()\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n* No popups.\r\n* Straightforward command implementation, pass whole command string to windows.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n* As laanwj pointed out it is using &strCommand[0]. Reason is that CreateProcessW might change that data, so we can't pass a const. \"[The Unicode version of this function, CreateProcessW, can modify the contents of this string](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682425%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)\". Why this affects the non \"W\" version I have no idea. Is the fix to copy the string? Or to just cast c_str() to (char*)? Unsure.\r\n\r\n### ShellExecute()\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n* Very consistent results while using SW_HIDE in the sixth argument of ShellExecute().\r\n* (Possible pro) users can change the SW_HIDE to SW_SHOW to change this behavior in a local build.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n* Command must be parsed. The gist above only breaks on first whitespace, this would need to be smarter (accept a quoted string).\r\n\r\n### ::system()\r\n**Pros**\r\n* Simple.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n* Popups everywhere!\r\n\r\nThoughts and opinions?

      "body" : "@kanzure well it's anecdotal but I did just test 10 days of blocknotify with that last commit. Worked great, barely a blip on the CPU radar (admittedly fast 4 core modern machine). My test script this time is just a .bat piping the block hash to a file. It added 145 blocks to the output file really quickly and was not noticeably different from running it without the script. Would walletnotify be appreciably different from that? What's a good way to test it I wonder? Guess I could trash my blockchain and let it reload with a walletnotify script. Suggestions on what to put in it?\r\n\r\nEdit: oh hum I probably don't have enough tx in my testnet wallet to really \"stress\" test anything. Other ideas for approaches to this?\r\n\r\nEdit2: watchonly addresses I guess, could just add tons of them. Is this worthwhile?\r\n\r\nEdit3: Well I'm not really sure how to measure the results of this, so I'm leaning towards not testing walletnotify explicitly for performance. Intuition tells me this is a more efficient solution than ::system() just for the raw fact that Windows doesn't have to setup/teardown a window for each launch.",
