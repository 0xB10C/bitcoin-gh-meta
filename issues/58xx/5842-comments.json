      "body" : "Please use the number of blocks on top of a block, rather than the height difference with the best known tip. This shouldn't be hard, as ActivateBestChain knows what tip we're working towards, so it could be passed down.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think you need a check to have a reasonable guess that pindexBestHeader is reasonably accurate/recent/valid, so you can't be cheated into skipping validation while being sybilled during IBD.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, just height can probably be skewed by an attacker. I think it's safer to look at difference in nChainWork, and divide that by best difficulty seen.\r\n\r\nAlso, removing the checkpoint verification before accepting a header means you're vulnerable to a memory usage DOS attack during IBD (a peer can give you a arbitrarily long low-difficulty headers).\r\n\r\nI'm generally in favor of reducing the relevance of checkpoints, but I think this patch is a way too large step at once. \r\n\r\nEDIT: fixed wrong code example",
