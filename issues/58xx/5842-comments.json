I think it's safer to look at difference in nChainWork, and divide that by best difficulty seen.\r\n\r\nAlso, removing the checkpoint verification before accepting a header means you're vulnerable to a memory usage DOS attack during IBD (a peer can give you a arbitrarily long low-difficulty headers).\r\n\r\nI'm generally in favor of reducing the relevance of checkpoints, but I think this patch is a way too large step at once.
