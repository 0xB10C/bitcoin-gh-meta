      "body" : "I'm happy about this approach.\r\n\r\nWe've seen operating system RNG's fail silently in really frightening ways several times over the last few years,  a belt-and-suspenders approach where silent failure at least gets a best effort bit of entropy-snake-oil (or maybe not so snakeoil: after going and writing a bunch of entropy collecting code I'm more impressed with the performance than I expected) seems to be a clear improvement.  OpenSSL's (and libressl's) system entropy randomness generator is also pretty scary (it can fail silently back to snakeoil entropy much weaker than what this code does).\r\n\r\nWe'll want to take good care to make sure GetOSEntropy is portable and safe.  Maybe we should introduce a startup time test to get GetOSEntropy that just checks that it's not outputting a constant. I wouldn't expect an _actual_ OS failure to do that, but e.g. if some massive screwup has replaced /dev/urandom with a file (easier than you might think...) it could be helpful.\r\n\r\nRight now this code has no fork safety.  A fork() will end up with a clone of the pool state. That StrongRandom always goes to the OS helps add confidence that total doom is unlikely, but we might want to deal with this case even though we never fork just in case someone adds something that forks later and doesn't think about it.  A PID vs last_pid test in the random calls that triggers a GetSystemRand(slow=0) would I think be all that it would take.\r\n\r\nBeyond the nits I am adding the only big obvious gaps were that there is no facility to roll entropy from the pool forward across restarts. We should probably GetStrongRandom() on clean shutdown and write out a entropy file that gets fed back in at startup.  Perhaps system rand can take an argument, and thats how the config environment could also be passed in?\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of missed opportunities to collect extra entropy (e.g. from UI events; UPNP real-IP, other hosts provided ping nonces) that don't fit into line level patches, as those files aren't even touched.",

At the time, thought about calling the OpenSSL insecure rand, but its API was not orthogonal to secure rand, unfortunately.  It had side effects I wasn't happy with, so just stuck with the regular OpenSSL secure rand, even though I wasn't happy about it needlessly consuming the entropy pool, which is a somewhat precious resource.  Would it be worth changing the ping nonce to use insecure rand instead, or keep it secure and await this fine new implementation?\r\n",
