In the long term I don't think we can have the library that way (or callers will use random internal symbols). In the short term sure.\r\n\r\nThe size increase is smaller than I expected;  8% is worth a reduction in consensus risk and getting binaties working on debian wheezy esp considering how unstable in the fine details stdc++ has been historically.  I'm not aware of any problems with static stdc++ of the sort that libc, and many commercial applications do this already. So indeed, it sounds good to me.",
