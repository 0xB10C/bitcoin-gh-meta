They are OS-independent and should even work in a completely static computational environment like moxiebox.\r\n\r\nThis is analogous to leveldb's `port_*` and `env_*`. There is a slight overlap with `compat`, although compat deals with (pure) functions that lack from a certain C/C++ library but are part of some standard.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should write a plan how we like the tree organized so that these things are more clear. Maybe there are good arguments why `allocators` makes sense as a category/library of itself, I just think that the default should be to try to fit something into a broad category and not create too many subdirs of `src/`.\r\n",
