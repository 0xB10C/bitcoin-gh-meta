   "body" : "This contains some follow up items from #13033.\r\n\r\nThe PR refactors the GetTransaction function and moves it from validation to rpc/rawtransaction. This breaks a cyclic dependency between validation and index/txindex pointed out by @sipa. Also, the REST transaction API and gettxoutproof RPC now have more clear error messages when the txindex is not available, as requested by @TheBlueMatt.\r\n\r\nThis would also be a good opportunity to drop the slow tx lookup through the unspent coins view if people are for it, as proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/3220.",
