   "body" : "Previously, ChainStateFlushed would fire either if a full flush\r\ncompleted (which can happen due to memory limits, forced flush, or\r\non its own DATABASE_WRITE_INTERVAL timer) *or* on a\r\nChainStateFlushed-specific DATABASE_WRITE_INTERVAL timer. This is\r\nboth less clear for clients (as there are no guarantees about a\r\nflush having actually happened prior to the call), and reults in\r\nextra flushes not clearly intended by the code. We drop the second\r\ncase, providing a strong guarantee without removing the periodit\r\ntimer-based flushing.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to discussion in #11857.",
