Connection/disconnection/misbehavior events could then have INFO priority, while the mish-mash of individual messages would only be logged at DEBUG.\r\nThis creates a Cartesian product of category ÃÂ level, the same as in many other applications that log.\r\nI've proposed it before in an IRC meeting but no one liked it at the time, happy to get some support :)",
