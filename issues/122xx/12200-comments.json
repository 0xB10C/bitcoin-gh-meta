I could imagine we'd want to test bitcoind's ability to accept incoming connections on multiple interfaces (in fact it's something I've considered adding to the test suite in the past). \r\n\r\nEven though only one platform complains, I think the warning is fair. From a security point of view it's better to not listen on any public interfaces during testing.\r\n\r\nAlso the tests cannot assume the presence of any interfaces besides loopback (and they don't - I checked this by running in an environment with just `lo`).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't exclude doing specific (multi interface) bind tests in a separate, platform-specific test as @Sjors proposes. This could use Linux network namespaces `ip netns add ` to simulate a small LAN, for example. But there's no reason to do so in tests that e.g. test the wallet.\r\n",
