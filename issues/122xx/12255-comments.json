      "body" : "Thanks for your ping in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12102#issuecomment-362968939, here are my thoughts on this PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following changes to the systemd bitcoind.service file\r\n1. Provide `-datadir` argument to bitcoind via ExecStart\r\n2. Create various runtime directories and set their access mode\r\n3. Set the Group to bitcoin\r\n\r\nI deliberately did not put (1) in the systemd file as it can also be set via bitcoind's conf. I believe that it is good practice to put as much as possible in generic service config file (here: bitcoin.conf) as opposed to the system's service management facilities (here: systemd).\r\n\r\n(2) is typically done by the distribution's package manager and would hence override settings of distributions that don't use those standard directories (therefore those distributions would need to patch the upstream systemd file or use their own, which is not both not desirable). Nit: I don't think it is necessary to protect the runtime directory with 700 as there a no secrets in it. Also the used settings are only available with systemd >= 235.\r\n\r\n(3) is changes the behavior as it explicitly mentions the existence of a group named 'bitcoin', which may or may not exist. I believe that the behavior if 'Group' is not set, using the default group of the user, is more portable and should be used.\r\n\r\nFurther nits of this PR include that the order of `-pid` and `-conf` is changed for no reason, and the (correct)  comment telling us that the `/run/bitcoind` is owned by 'bitcoin' is removed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I am not provided with and don't see any compelling reasons to apply this.",

      "body" : "@Flowdalic The spirit of my PR is to follow in the footsteps of `doc/init.md`. Which states that these changes are to be made.\r\n\r\n(1) `doc/init.md` states that the data directory should be at `/var/lib/bitcoind`, but if it's not indicated in the service file, the data directory is not at `/var/lib/bitcoind`, but rather at `~/.bitcoin`\r\n(2, 3) `doc/init.md` states that \"The configuration file, PID directory (if applicable) and data directory should all be owned by the bitcoin user and group. It is advised for security reasons to make the configuration file and data directory only readable by the bitcoin user and group. Access to bitcoin-cli and other bitcoind rpc clients can then be controlled by group membership.\". Perhaps according to the last sentence it'd be better to set the permissions to 750?\r\n\r\nIf someone was installing from source, and reading from `doc/init.md`, they would experience all kinds of confusion, as the data directory won't be where `doc/init.md` indicated it is. With 2 and 3 I think it's reasonable to think that this is optional, but my personal opinion is that what's in the repository should reflect the latest best practices and be consistent.\r\n\r\nI'm actually torn for what we should do for (2), while I believe it's better to have consistency on our end and have the distributions figure it out, I don't wanna break things for distributions with alternative `hier`s.\r\n\r\nHappy to discuss more :smile: ",

Like @dongcarl is saying, I was a bit confused when it came to configuring the data directory. It worked when I added the `-datadir` option to the service file.\r\n\r\nI tried adding `datadir=/var/lib/bitcoind` to `bitcoin.conf` like @Flowdalic suggested, but Bitcoin failed to start. Running `journalctl -xe`, I see the the error `boost::filesystem::create_directories: Permission denied: \"/home/bitcoin\"`. It seems this option in the config file has no effect.",

Some examples:\r\n\r\n- `elements` uses the bitcoin auth cookie file thru its `-mainchainrpccookiefile` flag for its RPC calls to bitcoind\r\n- `c-lightning` allows specifying the bitcoin data directory thru its `--bitcoin-datadir` flag\r\n\r\nPerhaps what should be done is to make the permissions for the datadir 770 or 750, so that these applications can run under the `bitcoin` group and automatically get rw/ro access to it.",

The change makes bitcoin more consistent with other services, makes the systemd config more consistent with existing upstart and openrc configs.

But if there are use-cases for wanting to use our service files but also needing the ability to change datadir from the config file, there are changes we could make to bitcoind to support removing the -datadir=/var/lib/bitcoind startup argument. For example we could change GetDefaultDataDir to return \"$BITCOIN_HOME\" if it is set, instead of \"$HOME/.bitcoin\", with no loss of compatibility. (GnuPG has a similar GNUPGHOME variable.)
