In addition bech32 is used by Lightning, so calling this \"native segwit\" might lead to confusion.

Which is another argument in favor of \"bc1 address\".\r\n\r\n`*` = the prefix is implied by the URI, whereas in bitcoin:bc1... the prefix is redundant.

Also note that double clicking on the right side of a bitcoin cash address will only select the bits after the colon, which should confuse their users and is probably the reason for using 1 as a separator in the standard.

Though preventing an erroneous send won't stop the user from being confused and doing something to fix it that makes things worse since UI's can't give feedback. I'd take a bet that someone will create a spinoff that doesn't change the effective HRP for the checksum, since it's not operably part of the address.\r\n\r\nI don't think they're all that visually similar compared to any other string of encoded data, but the big difference is the bc1 prefix--- talking about that more will make people pay attention to it.

Secondly it raises the bar for other wallets / services and gives them some confidence they're not wasting engineering time. See e.g. [this tweet from Kraken](https://twitter.com/krakensupport/status/949596199006306304).\r\n\r\nLike RBF, I think this needs to happen in two phases: first we clearly offer it to the user and then - assuming no unexpected problems arise and the rest of the industry actually adopts it - we make it the default.\r\n\r\nMaking it the default now would lead to confusion, especially from users who don't even notice the checkbox, suddenly see a different address format and think something is wrong with their wallet. I forgot the word for \"UX should not change as fast as technology allows, but should respect human ability to adapt to these changes\", but it's similar to how Apple used [Skeuomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) on their early iPhones but switched to more abstract representations (and relied more on gestures) once people became familiar with smart phones in general.",
