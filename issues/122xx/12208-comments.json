In addition bech32 is used by Lightning, so calling this \"native segwit\" might lead to confusion. I also don't think the phrase \"native SegWit\" is any less intimating than \"bech32\".\r\n\r\nMaybe call it \"Use modern address format (Bech32)?\"\r\n\r\nAdding support back for `-addresstype=legacy` makes the tooltip either longer or more vague, because you can't mention \"P2SH wrapped SegWit\". But not the end of the world. Mixing @flack's, @makomk's and your own suggestion:\r\n\r\n> The generated address begins with bc1 and lowers your fees when you spend it (BIP173). These addresses are not accepted everywhere yet. If the sender says your address is invalid, turn off this option to generate a address beginning with 1 or 3.\r\n\r\nAlternatively \"beginning with a digit\" or make the \"1\" and \"3\" a variable in the string that you can switch during runtime.",
