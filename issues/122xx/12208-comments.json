In addition bech32 is used by Lightning, so calling this \"native segwit\" might lead to confusion.

Which is another argument in favor of \"bc1 address\".\r\n\r\n`*` = the prefix is implied by the URI, whereas in bitcoin:bc1... the prefix is redundant.

Also note that double clicking on the right side of a bitcoin cash address will only select the bits after the colon, which should confuse their users and is probably the reason for using 1 as a separator in the standard.

Instead of has the problem of having no useful error reporting, in addition to had the problem that cross application usage would be more likely to be falsely accepted.\r\n\r\n> However, the checksum will still prevent accidents.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the time: but not all the time-- the HRP they use is so long that any replacement one is going to exceede the guaranteed detection difference and possibly accept a swapped address however this would be very rare.  Though preventing an erroneous send won't stop the user from being confused and doing something to fix it that makes things worse since UI's can't give feedback. I'd take a bet that someone will create a spinoff that doesn't change the effective HRP for the checksum, since it's not operably part of the address.\r\n\r\nI don't think they're all that visually similar compared to any other string of encoded data, but the big difference is the bc1 prefix--- talking about that more will make people pay attention to it.
