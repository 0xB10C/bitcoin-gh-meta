Possible extensions:\r\n\r\n* Could have a whitelist for optional rpc parameters. @luke-jr created #11660 making handling of RPC options more consistent, and he has proposed doing a broader options cleanup that could help with this: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11660#discussion_r151415264.\r\n* Could whitelist based on RPC authorization. For example, Luke's #10615 restricts access to wallets based on this.",

      "body" : "Can you give an example use-case? As presented it sounds reasonable, though I'm a bit concerned about real-world utility.\r\n\r\nRPC should definitely not be open to the world, no matter how locked down, so I'll assume that you're referring to a localhost or encrypted tunnel.\r\n\r\nIn that case, access to the user's profile dir should already be assumed. So I can't imagine locking down for the sake of privacy, but maybe to ensure maximum availability. So maybe you disable getblocktemplate because you don't want some jerk employee mining and wasting cpu resources from your exchange's edge node.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you run a website that shows mempool data, so you want to unlock rpc access for a bitcoind on your subnet, with access mempool data only.\r\n\r\nDo those examples sound about right?\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced that it's necessary because (other than wallet), there's no privilege separation between the commands, so only real need for black/whitelists would be: \"some rpc call is an effective DoS on my server so I want to block it\". I'm not sure that we should be encouraging that, rather than just not having DoSsy rpcs :(\r\n\r\nThat said, a few things to look into:\r\n- We already have a \"safe mode\" that limits usable commands when we're uneasy about the chain we're on. That's not useful here, but it may be hepful to look at how it's implemented.\r\n- Echoing what @ryanofsky said, tying this to auth makes sense to me, so that different rpc users can have different command access.",
