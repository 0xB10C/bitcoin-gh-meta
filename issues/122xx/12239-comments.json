You need to use `addmultisigaddress` if you want to add it to your wallet. Thus, your wallet doesn't understand how to sign for that address, you should add the optional extra parameter to signrawtransaction `prevtxs` in which you can include the redeemScript for the output, so it knows how to sign it.\r\n\r\nIn future, please direct usage questions to https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com not here, this is only for bugs/issues/feature requests for bitcoin core not for support :)",
