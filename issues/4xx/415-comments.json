Its a cool feature for those who wish to make their bitcoin usage anonymous, but by itself it does not even get close to providing anonymity.  It also pushes the wrong message about bitcoin: it was designed to be, and is anonymous; and that it is great for use in illegal activity.  That message should be highly avoided as it is highly detrimental to the adoption of bitcoin.  This as a separate branch is cool, but it should not be in the mainline IMO.  Additionally, does this work as expected if you are using a OP_EVAL address or a compressed pubkey address?",

My idea is that the UI bits (dialogs, widgets, screens) are independent of a specific bitcoin implementation. The UI bits communicate with the models through method calls and Qt signals. The models communicate with the core in whatever way they need to; that includes changing globals if you really need to, though I'd personally prefer it as parameter to minimize the factor of surprise.\n\nThanks\n",

In the coin control tab I'm seeing all the new addresses separated from each other and the change by blank lines, suggesting there's no way of tying the together, but they're all outputs of the same transaction.  Is that a bug?  I would expect all the new outputs as well as the change to be lumped in with the big group that the input was part of before this transaction.",

It only links input addresses (since the same person obviously controls them) as well as the change (which can usually be identified).  So in general it tries to link things that someone else would be able to link, not what you would be able to link.  If we changed the logic to be what you would be able to link, why not just link your whole wallet right off the bat?  That said, the change linkage disappearing after you send to it is a legit problem.\r\n\r\n",

True if the two input sets are disjoint (have no members in common).\r\nSets are sorted, so you can iterate through them in order rather than having to compare every member of the first with every member of the second.\r\n\r\nBut first give me a chance to rewrite the GetAddressGroupings function to no longer need IsDisjoint().",
