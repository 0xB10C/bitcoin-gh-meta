I know, I was just wishing if it could use some kind of fingerprint scan hash for key\r\nJul 24 02:14:07 <jrmithdobbs>\ti'm working on using OTP-ish stuff for dm_crypt key storage ;p\r\nJul 24 02:14:24 <phantomcircuit>\tthe fingerprint is stored as a hash of some data structure, but it only results in like 12 bits of entropy\r\nJul 24 02:14:27 <jrmithdobbs>\t(technically it's challenge-response, but in a semi-onetime way)\r\nJul 24 02:14:28 <Diablo-D3>\tjrmithdobbs: still, the problem is this\r\nJul 24 02:14:31 <BlueMatt>\tphantomcircuit: well yea, someone can grab a scan of your print from a glass or something...\r\nJul 24 02:14:35 <Diablo-D3>\tjrmithdobbs: I do _not_ want to deploy my own auth scheme\r\nJul 24 02:14:38 <BlueMatt>\tphantomcircuit: thats it?\r\nJul 24 02:14:46 <phantomcircuit>\tBlueMatt, no you can bruteforce it trivially\r\nJul 24 02:14:49 <Diablo-D3>\tjrmithdobbs: its easy to code, its easy to secure from the electronic side\r\nJul 24 02:14:52 <jrmithdobbs>\tDiablo-D3: internally?\r\nJul 24 02:14:54 <BlueMatt>\tphantomcircuit: 2**12 sounds way too small\r\nJul 24 02:14:58 <Diablo-D3>\tjrmithdobbs: yeah\r\nJul 24 02:15:04 <jrmithdobbs>\twhy wouldn't you deploy your own auth scheme?\r\nJul 24 02:15:05 <phantomcircuit>\tBlueMatt, lol it is\r\nJul 24 02:15:07 <Diablo-D3>\tjrmithdobbs: but its not actual authentication\r\nJul 24 02:15:11 <BlueMatt>\tphantomcircuit: maybe that was some old model?\r\nJul 24 02:15:40 <prof7bit>\tfingers can be hacked easily.\r\nJul 24 02:15:48 <jrmithdobbs>\tBlueMatt: i don't trust biometric scanners, almost all of them have ended up having HORRIBLEY simple spoofing methods\r\nJul 24 02:15:51 <BlueMatt>\tyea, they can get a print from something you touch...\r\nJul 24 02:15:55 <jrmithdobbs>\tBlueMatt: at least, not as a lone factor\r\nJul 24 02:15:56 <phantomcircuit>\tBlueMatt, my T61's builtin fingerprint swipe would result in a 64 bit \"hash\" of which the first 42 bits where trivially predicted\r\nJul 24 02:16:11 <Diablo-D3>\tjrmithdobbs: I can have them put an email in, and then even send a click me auth url to the email, it still doesnt tell me who the people really are\r\nJul 24 02:16:14 *\tsenseles (senseless@112.202.74.41) has joined #bitcoin-dev\r\nJul 24 02:16:18 <phantomcircuit>\tnot to mention that my fingerprints where all over the thing anyways lol\r\nJul 24 02:16:22 <BlueMatt>\tphantomcircuit: damn...again though, maybe that was an old",
