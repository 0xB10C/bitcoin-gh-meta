After he restarted the core the node had to re-scan all blocks loaded during a year.  Are there any hints for:\r\n\r\n1. How to terminate dnsseed thread but not terminating bitcoin-qt to let it finish DB update? If I'm sending SIGQUIT to thread PPID by htop it interrupting whole bitcoin-qt and the database block count remains as before bitcoin-qt start. Is there a different way, may be some Bitcoin Core RPC request or operating system message? Anything that will close dnsseed but let bitcoin-qt to finish.\r\n2. May I can change the order of closing operations to let the database finish it's operation before ThreadDNSAddressSeed? If yes then how to do that in sources?\r\n3. I'm not satisfied by node database behavior on unexpected exits. Why after SIGQUIT or any other exits except normal stop there are none already loaded and scanned blocks  present in chain state? After unexpected stop the blocks which was acquired during last run are not in the chain and are need to be re-scanned. May be some mechanism for periodic database update is needed to not loose a lot of CPU time for rescan, for example, a year of uptime? I'd prefer periodic, say, daily, database maintenance procedure to keep the blocks validated even in case of unexpected node operation interruption.",
