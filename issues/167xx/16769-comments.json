If there is no key named Bitcoin Core (64-bit) under HKLM\\SOFTWARE, nothing gets deleted.\r\n\r\nThis delete command from your PR is just \"Bitcoin\".\r\n\r\n`DeleteRegKey HKCU \"SOFTWARE\\Bitcoin\"`\r\n\r\nWith some more testing I've found that the `HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Bitcoin` is where some user specific settings are stored, seems to be mainly GUI and default settings. It's debatable whether this should be cleaned up when the app is uninstalled however that's outweighed by the fact that it's existing behaviour that users will certainly be depending on. IMHO this key needs to stay as is.\r\n\r\nThe other delete key in the PR wasn't needed in my testing:\r\n\r\n`DeleteRegKey HKLM \"SOFTWARE\\Bitcoin Core (@WINDOWS_BITS@-bit)`\r\n\r\nThe existing installer (bitcoin-0.18.1-win64-setup.exe from https://bitcoin.org/en/download) already deletes that key as a result of:\r\n\r\n`DeleteRegKey /IfEmpty HKCU \"${REGKEY}\"`",
