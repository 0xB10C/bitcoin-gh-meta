The user can't change it in the intro screen, but can change it later. I'm tempted to increase that default to 10 GB, and then have the intro screen reduce it if space is really tight.\r\n\r\nTips for testing:\r\n* move your existing data dir elsewhere\r\n* wipe data dir at every restart (behavior is different if it exists)\r\n* launch with `bitcoin-qt -resetguisettings -lang=en` (there's some space issues in different languages)\r\n* fake your free space by changing `intro.cpp` line 90: `freeBytesAvailable = 5000000000; // 5 GB`\r\n* try both testnet and mainnet, because settings are seperate. In particular note how step 7 in `GuiMain` switches where `QTSettings settings` points to; this had me thoroughly confused on testnet, because I was setting them too early.",
