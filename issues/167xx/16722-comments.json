I'm more afraid that this will be one of those changes that causes lots of subtle future grief due to edge-cases in libtool, automake, ccache, non-glibc builds, dependency generation (gcc's \"-M*\" options), etc.\r\n\r\n> Clang has the \"system-header-prefix\" option, which could be hooked up to depends with just a few lines.

This PR is an alternative.\r\n\r\n> It seems a bit overkill that we'd add an on-by-default flag to configure to hide a couple warnings from leveldb.\r\n\r\nThere are much more warnings in #15822, #16387, #16710  ;) This PR is a step to implement building with `-Werror=suggest-override`.\r\n\r\n> Have the changes been made upstream to \"fix\" the warnings, rather than just hiding them here?\r\n\r\nIMHO, it is not safe to update leveldb subtree just to \"fix\" warnings. This PR suggests a more conservative approach to removing noise from a build log.\r\n\r\n",
