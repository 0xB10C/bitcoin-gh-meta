   "body" : "The BIP 9 warning checker finds the blocks to warn on by computing the block version number that it would generate based on current active BIP 9 deployments. For buried deployments, their deployment parameters are removed from the active deployments array, so the warning checker triggers a false positive warning when it comes upon the blocks that activated the buried deployment as their version numbers do not match what it computes.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the warning checker to take into account these buried deployments. When it scans through history, it includes the activation bits for buried forks as long as the height of the block it is checking is less than the activation height of the deployment. Thus it will find the blocks that activate buried deployments to have the correct version bits set so it does not trigger a false positive warning.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this, the BIP 9 buried deployments (CSV and Segwit) are moved into an array of structs that contain their activation height and bit, in a similar way to active deployments.\r\n\r\nCloses #16697",
