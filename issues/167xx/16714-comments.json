It fails the second time and instead the settings dialog will show `-prune=0` as an override.\r\n\r\n> A long time ago, there was a similar (or same) issue with `strDataDir` in QSettings. \r\n\r\nThe reset code contains a workaround for `strDataDir`. It stores it in a temp variable, resets the settings and then sets it again. I could do the same thing for `prune`, but keep in mind that the Intro dialog isn't always shown. So if the default data dir exists and you reset your settings, then prune would still be enabled. I'd rather turn it around and add an explicit setter for the datadir.",
