So far though the [C++ gRPC library](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/cpp) is actively maintained.\r\n\r\nAdding a new dependency involves quite a bit of review work, including testing on the many OS / distros we support. That's very often not worth the benefits. For example streaming transaction notifications can be done with ZMQ, even if that's perhaps less easy to use than gRPC.\r\n\r\nStill, I would be interested in seeing a proof of concept. Fair warning though: given the above it may take a *long* time to get anything merged, if at all.",
