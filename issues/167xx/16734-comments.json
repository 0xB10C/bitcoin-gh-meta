      "body" : "So should we avoid `make dist` in the gitian builds, or put a `git archive` step in the dist-hook? The latter would make two tarballs & have issues with gitignore, which is undesirable. But at the same time, not using `make dist` goes against autotools principles.\r\n\r\nAlso, the generated build files are automatically added to the tarball in `make dist`. If we plan to `git archive` the original source, they'd still have to be generated and appended. `EXTRA_DIST` directories might just be easier for standard `make` targets.\r\n\r\nGenerated files that we want to include (I think):\r\n```\r\naclocal.m4\r\nMakefile.in\r\nconfigure\r\nconfig.guess\r\nconfig.sub\r\n(recursive)\r\n\r\nltmain.sh\r\ninstall-sh\r\ndepcomp\r\n(recursive)\r\n\r\nsrc/config/bitcoin-config.h.in\r\nsrc/secp2561/src/libsecp256k1-config.h.in\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated info:\r\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/automake/faq/autotools-faq.html#Which-files-are-hand_002dwritten-and-which-generated-_0028and-how_0029_003f\r\n",
