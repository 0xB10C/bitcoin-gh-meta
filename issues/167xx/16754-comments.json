The sooner this is done, the better.\r\nThe fact that there are also translations for the website there makes it even better.\r\n\r\nMoving all the translations could be done in less than a day (I can do it), but the issue would be to let the people know we've moved. Apart from updating the links we'd also have to let people know on social media and on the \"old\" transifex project as well. However, I believe that if some of us make an effort to let people know we moved (and that we need new translators), a lot of new people will join.\r\n\r\nStaying on the old project without full access is only going to get worse with time.",
