This will mess up appmenu integration in Ubuntu, for example, and other distro-specific customization.\r\n\r\nUsing an executable linked against 4.6 headers with 4.8 is safe, as Qt is backwards compatible. This has always been the case with the executables built on Ubuntu 10.04!\r\n\r\nBTW: if you show dependencies please show the *direct* dependencies. The current bitcoin-qt only  has a few libraries it depends, on, none at all X or font libraries. I suppose it should even work with non-X qt (for example wayland).\r\n```\r\nobjdump -p bin/32/bitcoin-qt |grep NEEDED                                                                                        \r\n  NEEDED               librt.so.1\r\n  NEEDED               libQtGui.so.4\r\n  NEEDED               libQtNetwork.so.4\r\n  NEEDED               libQtCore.so.4\r\n  NEEDED               libpthread.so.0\r\n  NEEDED               libstdc++.so.6\r\n  NEEDED               libm.so.6\r\n  NEEDED               libgcc_s.so.1\r\n  NEEDED               libc.so.6\r\n```\r\nAs you see this is already a bare minimum.

This pull can be trivially updated to use 5.3 rather than 5.2, but I'm unsure if the theme plugins will load when using a static build. I'm testing that right now.",

Meaning that themes can't be loaded dynamically from a static binary.\r\n\r\nI spent a little while investigating the stability of the interfaces for appmenu-qt, and it seems that it would be no problem to link in statically, since there are only 2 functions in the external api, and the rest happens over dbus. Unfortunately though, it means that bitcoin-qt would gain a dependency on libgtk+ and libglib2, so that's a non-starter.\r\n\r\nSince there's no obvious benefit in moving to 5.3, I left it at 5.2.1. 5.3 can be dropped in later with no changes necessary, except that this workaround can be removed: https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/d124f1120d41344555b984d1dbc5840ac25c1073#diff-8fd2f50cc3bac9865790ada2825a3006R131\r\n\r\nAlso, note that the move of qt's build into the -deps descriptor was not arbitrary.

It might have made sense to have the Qt build in with the deps when it's just the headers etc, but Qt is a huge package to build and it would be best to separate it out. What's wrong with the approach we use for Windows, where the deps are an input for Qt?",

I realize that's out of the scope of this PR and I really don't like doing that, but I added it here because it touches the same stuff as Linux. It's not useful yet, just groundwork (though I do have local hacks that make it fully work).\r\n\r\nThis needs to be tested for regressions before switching. There's an issue with the systray icon colors being inverted which I haven't yet poked at, but that's pretty minor.",
