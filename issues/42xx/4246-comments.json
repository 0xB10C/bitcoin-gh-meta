      "body" : "I believe the problem is that when processing the block, the header is already processed. This means that 290000's header is already in mapBlockIndex when its block data is processed. As that invokes CheckBlock, which on its turn invokes CheckBlockHeader again, which calls GetLastCheckPoint, which returns the block being verified itself, and then compares its parent against that, resulting in time seemingly going backward.\r\n\r\nTwo possible solutions:\r\n* Make GetLastCheckpoint take the verification level of the mapBlockIndex passed into account, and ignore not-fully-validated ones (easier).\r\n* Pass chainActive to GetLastCheckpoint instead of mapBlockIndex, which will never contain a block itself while it is still being verified (cleaner, imho).\r\n",
