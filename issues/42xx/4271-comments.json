The current grab-bag inputs directory is a hack in itself.\r\n\r\nIt would be better if gitian could source from multiple inputs directories so the intermediate files could live in their own directories. Combined with support for output to a configurable directory, the move/copy step after dependency builds could be skipped completely (also making it impossible to forget it!).\r\n",
