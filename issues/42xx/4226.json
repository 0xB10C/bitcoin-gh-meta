If this information is available,\r\nthis patch adds it to the json output of decoderawtransaction.\r\n\r\nOn IRC recently I was explaining to somebody how to interpret the output\r\nof decoderawtransaction. It was a pain to tell him to go look up each of the\r\ninput txouts separately, when I knew they were all unspent and sitting in\r\nhis wallet, so his bitcoind had ready access to them.",
