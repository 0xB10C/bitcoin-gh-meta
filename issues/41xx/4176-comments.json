I think this is the only way to get them to actually read it.\n\nI think the contents should be as explicit as possible, to reduce people's ability to convince themselves that they know better.\n\nA lot of footgun issues happen when people import/export keys, use them for some operation, and then delete the wallet; I think a warning specifically advising that \"DELETING ANY WALLET, EVEN AN APPARENTLY EMPTY WALLET, IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIKELY TO CAUSE LOSS OF COINS\" could _potentially_ help.\n\n(But not every footgun issue involves deleting a perceived-to-be-empty wallet; there's also the issue of exporting a privkey and handing it to an untrusted party. And any tutorial that advises doing that is probably malicious rather than stupid, which means any gate we add, the tutorial will explicitly instruct the user to bypass or ignore. So that's a harder issue than the one above.)\n",

The only effect is adding one step to the development of such software.\r\n\r\nI would argue an RPC is either dangerous or not, regardless of who calls it. If an RPC is dangerous, I think that logic should live in the RPC itself (not a client) and be applied regardless of the caller. By doing this through the RPC interface, we are communicating to software writers, `bitcoin-cli` users, users writing cURL commands, and any future client that these RPCs are dangerous and extra care should be taken. I don't think there is much difference between requiring a user to add an extra flag vs adding an extra step to software development. The goal is to communicate \"here be dragons.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, I think modeling the logic in the RPC interface provides a cleaner way of communicating to all clients \"hey, in this new release, we are marking X RPC as dangerous and potentially deprecating it in the future.\" If we instead model this logic in one specific client (`bitcoin-cli`), there are likely many other clients who would benefit from knowing they are using dangerous RPCs but would be unaware.\r\n\r\nIf the worry is we will create a bunch of extra work for software already calling these dangerous RPCs, we could add a config option to `bitcoind` to bypass danger warnings (`-allowdangerousrpcs`) which is off by default. This at least requires the node operator to explicitly state they are fine with clients doing dangerous stuff.",
