      "body" : "I am a strong advocate for making them type out the warning message, rather than letting them click through it. I think this is the only way to get them to actually read it.\r\n\r\nI think the contents should be as explicit as possible, to reduce people's ability to convince themselves that they know better.\r\n\r\nA lot of footgun issues happen when people import/export keys, use them for some operation, and then delete the wallet; I think a warning specifically advising that \"DELETING ANY WALLET, EVEN AN APPARENTLY EMPTY WALLET, IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND LIKELY TO CAUSE LOSS OF COINS\" could _potentially_ help.\r\n\r\n(But not every footgun issue involves deleting a perceived-to-be-empty wallet; there's also the issue of exporting a privkey and handing it to an untrusted party. And any tutorial that advises doing that is probably malicious rather than stupid, which means any gate we add, the tutorial will explicitly instruct the user to bypass or ignore. So that's a harder issue than the one above.)",

A command-line option could work too but many people especially on windows don't know how to use them.\r\n\r\nA more extreme option would be to deprecate those RPCs and eventually remove them. There is now a dumpwallet/importwallet that can be used to import or export a whole wallet at once which avoids many of the disaster scenarios that happen with keys.\r\n",
