      "body" : "Primarily because of compatibility. We should be able to read wallets from the first version of bitcoin. Using different databases would create a larger burden here.\r\n\r\nAlso, at least in my experience, LevelDB databases seem to be less robust than BerkeleyDB ones and not as portable between platforms. The main advantage of LevelDB is that it's faster - which makes it very suitable for the UTXO/block chain indexes which can be rebuilt at any time anyway.\r\n\r\nThat said, there is nothing holding people back from making a wallet backend that stores the keys in any other key/value database.",
