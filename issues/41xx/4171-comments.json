AFAIK you can't force a fee policy on miners without soft forking.  An economically rational miner will be awarding their scarce resource - block space - to the highest bidders.\r\n\r\nI think the incentives are right at the moment.  Fixed fees make larger transactions cheaper on a percentage basis, which encourages maximum transaction volume through the blockchain, meaning that cheaper transactions will be the first to be pushed off-blockchain if it becomes unaffordable.  Subsidising blockspace for cheaper transactions flips this on its head and doesn't make economic sense for miners nor technical sense for scaling.",

      "body" : "Bitcoin is a consensus protocol. That means that every two nodes must be able to independently judge whether a block is valid, and come to the exact same conclusion. If two nodes disagree about whether a block is valid or not, they ignore each other (assuming the other is trying to attack them by serving invalid data). This means that if two groups of nodes with different rules both have hash power, but the larger of the two groups produces blocks the other side considers invalid, you get a blockchain fork. Both groups start working in their own world, ignoring the rest. This is a disaster: every coin that existed before the split can be spent once on each side.\r\n\r\nA \"soft fork\" is a change to the protocol rules that only makes things invalid that were previously valid. A soft fork is safe (doesn't actually cause the blockchain to fork) as long as majority of the hash power enforces the new rules.\r\n\r\nA \"hard fork\" is a change to the protocol rules that does anything else (change serialization, makes thing valid that would previously be invalid, ...). A hard fork requires every full node in the world to upgrade (not just the majority, and not just miners). Those who don't will inevitably end up with their own (slowly growing) chain.\r\n\r\nA policy is a rule that does not change the validity of blocks, and can't otherwise cause forks. These are usually about transactions, rather than blocks (as transactions are independent, and don't require the world to agree about any state). They include DoS protections, acceptance rules for entering the mempool, the scheduling miners use to put transactions into blocks, ...\r\n\r\nCurrently, the fee structure is a policy. You can change it in your client, and nothing will break. To an extent, every node in the network can change the policy to something they like, and things wouldn't break. The network wouldn't necessary keep working well, but at least nodes wouldn't start disagreeing about the state of the world.\r\n\r\nTo do what you want - enforce a fee structure - you must make them a consensus rule. Just implementing it as a transaction relay policy isn't enough: miners can just run different code, and as policy can't change the validity of a block, every node would need to accept those blocks, even if they don't like the transactions in it.\r\n\r\nTurning the fee rules into a consensus rule is technically possible. It would be a soft work (you want nodes to reject blocks that don't follow the fee rules), and that has associated risks. The only question is whether we want this to be a consensus rule. If we'd ever want to undo it, it would need a hard fork, so we better be sure about it.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it's such a dramatic change about the properties of the system (especially, future properties) that it would be a violation of the implied \"social contract\" of the system. However, that's not a very strong argument if it solves an actual or perceived problem.\r\n\r\nMore technically: how do you deal with decreasing subsidy? Who will pay miners for network security if the subsidy doesn't, and more is required than what your fee rules define? We don't know the future of the system, or for what kind of transactions it will be used. Maybe it will be many low-value transactions, maybe it will be few high-value transactions. Yes, variable fees are an inconvenience, but I don't think forcing a fee schedule is the solution. Over time, I think we'll see a fee market develop, but people live with changing gasoline prices too, no? ",

      "body" : "sipa: why would it *not* require a hard fork to implement yet require one to remove?\r\n\r\nAlso, the formula would rely on the percentage, which could be changed just like the base fixed fee is now.\r\n\r\nI think determining the proper percentage would take some research and discussion, but once implemented wouldn't need to be changed, ever. It would need to be set so that Bitcoin most \"regular\" bitcoin transactions have a very low fee compared to alternatives, just as they do now, yet would support the necessary mining infrastructure. Knowing what is \"necessary\" is up for debate.\r\n\r\nOnce the percentage was set then, again, we have a policy which is predictable which miners can choose to participate in or not.\r\n\r\nHere is the key takeaway: right now miners are rewarded with new coins. Nobody is in the mining business to make money with transaction fees. Once they are they need certainty. Transaction fees to miners are currently uncertain because they are fixed and therefore have little relation to a bitcoin's value -- and \"standard\" fees need to constantly chase a bitcoin's value and be changed. By implementing a percentage-based fee structure fees now become predictable for miners and they can plan, just as they can reasonably plan now for block reward halving. This in addition to the certainty that is gained by Bitcoin \"users.\"\r\n\r\nCertainty is good. :)",
