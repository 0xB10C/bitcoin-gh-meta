With headers-first validation, we will always know the headers for every block we download in advance, so they will be partially validated ahead of time.\r\n\r\nHeaders-first won't remove out-of-order blocks, but as their parents' (headers) will be known before, they won't be considered orphans anymore, and we will store them on disk, and process them fully when the data for all their parents is available as well.\r\n\r\nSo in a way, headers-first will accomplish what you're asking. Not by storing orphans, but by no longer needing to consider out-of-order blocks as orphans.",
