I then clicked delete, then I thought I had to highlight the area again to delete another.  I then realised that I could just keep clicking DELETE and delete more addresses even though no address was highlighted.\n\nI realised that a user could keep clicking DELETE and delete the wrong contact by mistake.\n\nThis is my first Issue report.  Be kind :)\n",
