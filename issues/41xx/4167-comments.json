This pretty much avoids the ambiguity, and also avoids the requirement for grouping to the right of the decimal point\r\n* With the exception of the Eurozone, fiat currency is largely country-specific anyway.  If I'm trying to send fiat to someone in another country or am requesting fiat payment from someone in another country then whether we write dots or commas really is the least of our problems\r\n\r\nAs for exchanging accounts, spreadsheets or other financial documents across international borders, this isn't something the general public does -- and accounting professionals  who work in this area will be used to the issues.\r\n\r\nWe're not special flowers here; the requirement to be able to accurately and precisely communicate numerical values across international boundaries -- where those values might be very large or very small, and might contain a large number of significant digits -- is not new to Bitcoin.  Smart people have already thought about this problem and solved it decades ago.  But if the Bitcoin community wants to reinvent the wheel, be my guest.\r\n\r\nI watch with some bemusement the reactions to suggesting we use this standard and widely adopted convention -- but I'm particularly interested in the reaction to grouping the digits to the right of the decimal point, which has ranged from surprise to active hostility.  What this really proves to me is that, even amongst a highly technical set of users, most people _really_ aren't used to dealing with numbers with more than a couple of digits to the right of the decimal point on a day-to-day basis.  More than anything, this convinces me that ÃÂµBTC is the only way to go.  (And I say this as someone who started out not that long ago as a units change skeptic.)",

Neither dots nor commas are inserted in the spaces between groups of three. However, when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit.\"\r\n\r\nSo you're right. It's 1000, but 10 000 and 1 000 000. Similarly 0.0001 but 0.000 01 and 0.000 000 1.",

(Well, boring at least in the sense that we don't have any particularly exotic number formatting conventions.)\r\n\r\nI'm interested because those in en_GB or en_US saying \"use locale-specific number formatting\" counts for little since it won't have much impact on us.  I'd like to here what people living in *different* locales want -- particularly people living in locales (such as de_DE) that use dot as the preferred thousands separator.\r\n\r\nI don't know, but strongly suspect, that people in de_DE (German German) have to contend with a mishmash of localized and non-localized software.  So that \"1.000\" *might* mean \"one thousand\" from a localized app, or it *might* mean \"exactly one\" from a non-localized app (that always uses a dot as the decimal point, regardless of locale).\r\n\r\nCase in point, Bitcoin Core is currently exactly such an app that always used dot, regardless of locale.\r\n\r\nSo it's not at all clear to me that de_DE residents will even thank us for switching from the current \"1000\" to a localized \"1.000\", since the latter probably can't be correctly interpretted without context.\r\n\r\nBut I'd love to know what people in those locales really think.\r\n\r\n",

This would mess up digit alignment in tabular data -- and it would also make it much harder to line up the decimal points.\r\n\r\nFortunately, looking at actual real life data, people don't actually like printing tables that look horribly misaligned.  I found two ways in which this was tackled in real life tabular data to the right of the decimal point (presumably the same approaches can be used to the left).\r\n\r\n* In a table where most values had four decimal places, but the odd one had five, they simply suspended the use of thin spaces\r\n\r\n````\r\n0.99955\r\n0.9956\r\n0.9812\r\n0.9703\r\n0.9672\r\n0.9721\r\n````\r\n\r\n* In a table where there were lots of numbers with five decimal places, but the odd one with four, they simply suspended the rule special casing four digits:\r\n\r\n````\r\n1.747 56\r\n1.772 67\r\n1.638 05\r\n1.641 32\r\n2.519 39\r\n2.408\r\n2.221 24\r\n4.171 9\r\n````\r\n\r\nSo it seems that we can be pragmatic and do what makes sense given the nature of the data.  It seems eminently doable to do something sensible with this here.",

But indeed, it makes sense to simply group per three, at least in the overview page and transaction overview, as having the numbers below each other align up is more important here.

Maybe people that want that should just switch to mBTC/muBTC to get the long slew of digits before the dot. But it might grow on me...\r\n",
