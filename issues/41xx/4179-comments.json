It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.",
