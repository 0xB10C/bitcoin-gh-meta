Unfortunately `shellcheck` does not allow for selecting specific warnings, so this is probably the best we can do :-)\r\n\r\nFrom the diff:\r\n\r\n> By showing only warnings in the ranges `SC1000-1199` and `SC2000-2199` we're intentionally opting out of new warnings introduced by new `shellcheck` versions. We do this in order to minimize the risk of the build breaking due to a new `shellcheck` version with a new check which we are violating.",
