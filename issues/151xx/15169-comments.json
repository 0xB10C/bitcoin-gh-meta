      "body" : "> we could relay transactions from a whitelisted peer that would cause us to be banned by an older peer\r\n\r\nThis seems bad.  The original motivation for making whitelist relay is long long long since dead (*).  Can we just eliminate this behaviour, as it makes whitelisting less useful and isn't useful itself?\r\n\r\nIf there is still any need for forced-relay transactions it could be accomplished by introducing a new P2P message that only whitelisted peers are allowed to use, that carries with it a TX whos relay is forced.\r\n\r\n(*) my recollection is that the original reason that behaviour was added was because people using armory would start armory and their bitcoin node at the same time, and their armory wallet would blast txn to send at bitcoind which would end up in its mempool but not relayed on the network because it had no actual peers up. ... then later attempts by armory to rebroadcast were ineffectual because the txn were already in the node's mempool.   However, because it causes all your peers to be flooded by txn relayed by your whitelisted neighbours it makes whitelisting useless outside of that armory usecase, unless you add the second option to force relay off. \r\n",

I guess I'm kinda surprised that there is a speedup at all considering that IBD doesn't seem to scale past 15/16 cores... which I'd assumed was due to synchronization overheads in the script validation thread dispatch.",
