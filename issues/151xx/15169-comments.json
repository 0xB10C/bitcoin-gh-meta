      "body" : "> we could relay transactions from a whitelisted peer that would cause us to be banned by an older peer\r\n\r\nThis seems bad.  The original motivation for making whitelist relay is long long long since dead (*).  Can we just eliminate this behaviour, as it makes whitelisting less useful and isn't useful itself?\r\n\r\nIf there is still any need for forced-relay transactions it could be accomplished by introducing a new P2P message that only whitelisted peers are allowed to use, that carries with it a TX whos relay is forced.\r\n\r\n(*) my recollection is that the original reason that behaviour was added was because people using armory would start armory and their bitcoin node at the same time, and their armory wallet would blast txn to send at bitcoind which would end up in its mempool but not relayed on the network because it had no actual peers up. ... then later attempts by armory to rebroadcast were ineffectual because the txn were already in the node's mempool.   However, because it causes all your peers to be flooded by txn relayed by your whitelisted neighbours it makes whitelisting useless outside of that armory usecase, unless you add the second option to force relay off. \r\n",

      "body" : "Updated to always use parallel validation for mempool transactions if scriptcheck threads are available, and also updated the OP to describe the current behavior.\r\n\r\nOne remaining open question in my mind is around the new behavior where a peer sending an invalid-according-to-consensus rules transaction would no longer be disconnected.  The motivation for this  is to mitigate adversarial behavior: in order to determine whether a transaction is invalid according to consensus rules (rather than policy) we end up validating a transaction's scripts twice, so an adversary trying a CPU DoS could construct transactions that only fail policy checks, but otherwise tie up our CPU for twice as long.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a non-adversarial case, where our peer is merely broken (or intended to operate on a different network) but non-malicious, this means that we will stay connected to the peer longer than we should.  This is also not ideal.  I have two ideas for addressing this, but I welcome other suggestions: \r\n\r\n(1) probabilistically evaluate failing transactions with consensus flags, and using the result to decide whether to disconnect a peer -- say we had a 1% chance of validating a failed transaction a second time, so that if a peer is giving us garbage we can figure it out relatively quickly while still limiting CPU usage for a bad transaction in the general case.\r\n\r\n(2) @TheBlueMatt suggested I refactor the checkqueue logic to pass back the reason for a script failure (say, the first script that fails when doing parallel validation), and then we use that to determine whether to disconnect a peer based on a single validation of scripts.  Assuming that there are no conceptual issues with this, then this should be optimal behavior for us.  This also seems a little invasive and IMO the gain here is not obviously worth the effort, but Matt suggested we might want this the next time a consensus change is proposed anyway.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on whether the behavior change proposed here is ok, or if I should pursue an alternate approach, such as one of the two ideas above?",
