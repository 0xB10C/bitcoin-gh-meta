   "body" : "This cleans up and refactors block file helpers so that they may be used by the block filter indexer. Per [design discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14121#issuecomment-451252591) about storing BIP 157 block filters, it has been suggested that they are stored in the same way as block and undo data. This refactor is sufficient to simplify file operations for this use case, though in the future perhaps more pruning-related logic ought to be moved into the new classes.\r\n\r\nThe basic abstraction is a `FlatFileSeq` which manages access to a sequence of numbered files into which raw data is written.\r\n",
