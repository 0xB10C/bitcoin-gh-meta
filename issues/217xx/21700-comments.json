That would allow us to drop `Socket::Get` (from `sock.h` at least), which in turn would mean that there is no risk of a `SOCKET` \"escaping\" `Socket` (other than using `Socket::Release`, and `Socket::Release` makes is clear that the responsibility of closing is taken over by the caller).\r\n\r\nWDYT? :)",
