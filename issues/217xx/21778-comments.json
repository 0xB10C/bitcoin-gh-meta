But it's great to see that linking finally works!\r\n\r\nFor a little extra context beyond what @fanquake said above, the macOS clang+cctools build has always been a wonky outlier because we have to build our own (very unsupported) toolchain first. LD64 is apple's libre/open-source linker, and there is a community project that maintains a [build environment for cross builds](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/cctools-port).\r\n\r\nFor a few years, there has been slow development on a darwin functionality for llvm's lld, but it's only really picked up speed and become usable in the last year or two. This PR would bring our Apple builds much more inline with others in that it would finally be using a supported libre/open-source compiler/linker combo.\r\n\r\n@fanquake Is cctools still needed at all?

Note that for x86_64 I'm currently using binaries I compiled (test at your own risk!), because the LLVM 14.0.0-rc1 tag on GitHub doesn't yet have the binaries we need: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-14.0.0-rc1.\r\n\r\nHave rewritten the PR description, and will update Guix builds. I've tagged this for 24.0 now. There are also some small changes here that can be split out and PR'd in advance.",
