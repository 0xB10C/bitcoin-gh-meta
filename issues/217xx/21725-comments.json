      "body" : "The signing certificate shows it was revoked on âTuesday, âMarch â24, â**2020**. This seems back-dated. Normally, this happens when a publisher discovers a key compromise and wants to invalidate all binaries signed after the key was considered as compromised. Is it the case here?\r\n\r\nI noticed the unsigned version was pushed on March 25, 2021, on the occasion of the signing certificate's expiration. That shouldn't be needed, as the installer was timestamped, therefore will remain valid despite the cert having expired. So, I don't see the connection between the expiration of the cert and its revocation effective a year earlier. Can someone clarify what's going on?",
