   "body" : "The main purpose of this change is to get rid of the dependency `blockfilterindex` dependency in `validation.cpp` that is only needed for deciding on the right prune height if the index is not fully synced. Clearing this also gets rid of two circular dependencies. This also paves the way to making `coinstatsindex` (#19521) work with a pruned chain which otherwise would also need to be a dependency of `validation.cpp` which in turn would also add another circular dependency.\r\n\r\nTo solve this a `m_prune_blockers` map is introduced to `BlockManager`. Entities like `blockfilterindex`, for example, can add a key and a height to block pruning over that height. These entities need to update that value to allow more pruning when they are ready.\r\n\r\nThis is only a VERY rough draft currently, as I am interested in concept/approach feedback.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Upon preparing this PR I found #19463 as an alternative that is much more fully-featured (start and stop height, persistence, RPCs). My minimalistic approach works for my stated purpose but happy to consolidate ideas and code if reviewers find that useful. So please also take a look at #19463 which hasn't received much review, unfortunately. ",
