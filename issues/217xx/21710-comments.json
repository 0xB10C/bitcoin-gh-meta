Indeed, as it's not documented AFAIK except in the 0.14 release notes a few years back, I imagine that many users won't ever know unless they look into the codebase, e.g. in `net.h`\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstatic const int MAX_ADDNODE_CONNECTIONS = 8;\r\n```\r\nand then verifying how the constant is used, or they infer it by using `-netinfo` with more than 8 addnode peers configured and seeing that the number of manual connections never exceeds 8 (or by using `getpeerinfo` with `jq`).\r\n  \r\n",

If you run a node with more than 8 `-addnode` peers (you can get a list of, say, 20 peers from your addrman if needed with `bitcoin-cli getnodeaddresses 20`), you'll never see more than 8 connections in the \"manual\" column of cli `-netinfo`:\r\n```\r\n        ipv4    ipv6   onion     i2p   total   block  manual\r\nin         0       0       1       0       1\r\nout        4       0      10       4      18       2       8\r\ntotal      4       0      11       4      19\r\n```\r\nCodewise, I suggest looking at the code returned by `git grep nMaxAddnode` -- there are only six lines.\r\n ",
