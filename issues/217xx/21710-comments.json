Indeed, as it's not documented AFAIK except in the 0.14 release notes a few years back, I imagine that many users won't ever know unless they look into the codebase, e.g. in `net.h`\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstatic const int MAX_ADDNODE_CONNECTIONS = 8;\r\n```\r\nand then verifying how the constant is used, or they infer it by using `-netinfo` with more than 8 addnode peers configured and seeing that the number of manual connections never exceeds 8 (or by using `getpeerinfo` with `jq`).\r\n  \r\n",
