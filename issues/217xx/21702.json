   "body" : "This is an implementation of  [BIP-119 OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki).  It has been rebased on top of Taproot / ST. The specification has been otherwise unrevised since publication nearly a year and half ago.\r\n\r\nMinus tests and deployment, it's about 180 LOC.\r\n\r\nThis branch activates against regtest so you can test on your local node, but does not include activation parameters for signet, although that could be added before release.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes standardness rules for a bare single CTV Hash script, which has applications for congestion control. Other than that there is limited support for bare scripts using CTV, although the patches to #16766 lay the groundwork for better wallet support with proper IsTrusted parents scanning, which can be amended later to handle chains of irrefutable transactions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about the design of BIP-119 at https://utxos.org/. In particular I recommend the workshop transcript and slides https://utxos.org/workshops/ for a thorough review of how CTV works.\r\n\r\nYou can stress test CTV for complex examples by trying out the Sapio compiler: learn.sapio-lang.org. There is also some support for CTV in miniscript via the [Sapio Rust Miniscript Fork](https://github.com/sapio-lang/rust-miniscript). \r\n\r\nDiscussion welcome at ##ctv-bip-review.",
