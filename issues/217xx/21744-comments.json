      "body" : "This is surprisingly difficult to fix (without doing huge amount of changes). I see two ways to address it:\r\n\r\n1. Hold the socket mutex while `poll()`ing, so that other threads that want to close the socket would have to wait for the `poll()` to finish. Not acceptable IMO.\r\n2. Lazy close with reference counting. Increment the reference count of the socket during `poll()`. Whenever a thread wants to close the socket (disconnect a peer) it should disable the socket for send/recv (e.g. `shutdown(2)`) but not `close(2)` it if reference count is >0 and somebody else should close all disabled sockets with reference count of 0.",
