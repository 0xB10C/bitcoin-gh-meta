Will add more jumping links later so navigation is easier.\r\n\r\nCurrent TODOs:\r\n- [ ] Shell installer option: prompt user to re-login for `/etc/profile.d` entry to be picked up\r\n- [ ] Binary tarball option: prompt user to create `/etc/profile.d` entry and re-login\r\n- [ ] Fanquake docker option: complete section\r\n- [ ] Arch Linux AUR option: prompt to start `guix-daemon-latest` unit after finishing \"optional setup\" section\r\n- [ ] Building from source option: Insert dependency tree diagram that I made\r\n- [ ] Building from source option: redo sectioning, kind of a mess right now\r\n- [ ] Optional setup: make clear which parts are only needed if building from source\r\n- [ ] Overall: Link to relevant Troubleshooting section wherever possible\r\n- [ ] Workaround 1 for GnuTLS: perhaps mention how to remove Guix build farm's key\r\n- [ ] Overall: Add numbered section headings, something like `1.1.1` so that hierarchy is clearer\r\n- [ ] Overall (after everything): Make the links work.\r\n\r\nNote to self: wherever possible, tell user how to check that something is true rather than branching by installation option.",
