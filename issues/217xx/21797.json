This flag/option will be available until v23, at which\r\n   point the deprecation will be removed entirely. Note that these fields are attributes of\r\n   the `scriptPubKey` object returned in the RPC response. However, in the response\r\n   of `decodescript` these fields are top-level attributes, and included again as attributes\r\n   of the `scriptPubKey` object.\r\n\r\nThe original issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20102 was resolved in this PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20286, and from v23 (\"addresses\" and \"reqSigs\" deprecated) \"ExtractDestinations\" should be removed.",
