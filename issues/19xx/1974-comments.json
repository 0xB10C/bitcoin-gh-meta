Adding that would require either duplicating a lot of code, or moving those calculations into their own function.\r\n\r\nRate limiting would be a bit easier, but the best way to do it would be open to question.

This solves their problems quickly and simply.  I'd rather see this get out quickly for those people, along with a note or something about the potential danger (and how to mitigate it for critical nodes) than make them keep waiting while we figure out how to make it safer under circumstances that may or may not ever happen.\r\n\r\nThen again, no one comes bitching to me when things don't work, so I defer to the judgment of the more experienced developers.",
