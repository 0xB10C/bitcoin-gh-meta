We hope to get to official support soon with #21851. \r\n\r\nYou can try one of two things for now: \r\n1) Try to compile `Bitcoin-Qt` natively through depends.\r\n    - for now this is experimental, and you are likely to run into issues doing so.\r\n2) Follow the steps that worked to resolve the issue for the person who opened #21402\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21402#issuecomment-801933139\r\n> Sorry for the late reply.\r\n> I downloaded the whole blockchains data and create a new wallet by Bitcoin Core 0.21 (binary release ,rosseta mode). \r\n> Then I copy my old wallet.dat to replace the new empty wallet file.All done, running successfully with no crash.\r\n> I don't know what happened before.I will reopen the issue if there is new crash.\r\n> Thank you all for replying my issue, a lot.\r\n\r\n",
