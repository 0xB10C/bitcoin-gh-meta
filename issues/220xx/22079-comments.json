Only if I remove settings the sockopt `ZMQ_IPV6` from both server (bitcoind, publisher) and client (zmq interface Test, subscriber) it works again :/ would be interesting to know if this behaviour also shows up on other systems (that are not covered by the CI).\r\nMaybe it is connected to this ZMQ change: https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/2631 but that's just a vague guess...",
