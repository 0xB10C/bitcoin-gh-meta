So holding the validation lock cs_main for sending a feefilter is confusing and might even degrade blockchain-related RPC performance minimally.\r\n\r\n`MaybeSendFeefilter` will break when called in multiple threads, because `g_filter_rounder.round` isn't thread safe (among others). Thus, annotating the function with `m_mutex_message_handling` seems a nice belt-and-suspenders compiler check for now. If there are more threads in the future, a special feefilter mutex can be introduced.",
