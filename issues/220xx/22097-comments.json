E.g., Alice submits a 400,001 weight transaction (100,001 vbytes) followed by a 3999 weight child transaction (1,000 vbytes).\r\n\r\nI don't think implementing this (with a bug fix for the above, if I'm correct) would be a disaster, but I think we should try to be consistent in the units we use in our external interfaces---so we either use vbytes everywhere or we use weight everywhere.  When choosing among those two units, we eventually bump into the feerate interfaces where we have a choice between trying to retrain a large number of users who currently think about fees in \"bytes\" per BTC (or sats), or instead training a a few dozen developers[1] that, to get vbytes from weight units, they need to put a `ceil()` around `weight/4`.  To me, the decision to be made there seems obvious.\r\n\r\n[1] Most wallets should probably be using a library that provides low-level functions for calculating sizes and feerates, so it's only the authors of those libraries who should need to read BIP141's simple and clear description of how to convert weight into vbytes.",
