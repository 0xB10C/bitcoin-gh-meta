   "body" : "The current [windows build doc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md) can lead someone to believe that the step where you must choose the posix mingw32 g++ compiler option is only for `Ubuntu 18.04`. It is only until you (or just me) go through the cross-compile process and realize that it's not building because you didn't set this option on > `Ubuntu 18.04`. Then you come back and read the footnotes and see: `Starting from Ubuntu Xenial 16.04...`.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves this portion of the doc by explicitly stating `Ubuntu 18.04 and up`. While here, some minor fixups and add some more guidance to completing this step.\r\n\r\n**Master:** [render](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md#building-for-64-bit-windows)\r\n**PR:** [render](https://github.com/jarolrod/bitcoin/blob/6e745eb00087df5646b16bc3d8612609337660a1/doc/build-windows.md#building-for-64-bit-windows)",
