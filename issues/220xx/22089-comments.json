      "body" : "Thanks for the explanation in the PR. I like your approach, but I'm wondering if this will still be accurate about `create_self_transfer`:\r\n`\"\"\"Create and return a tx with the specified fee_rate. Fee may be exact or at most one satoshi higher than needed.\"\"\"`\r\nBecause right now, using a fee rate of `Decimal(\"0.003\")` the P2PK tx will have a fee of `Decimal('0.0005025')`, but the exact fee rates should either be\r\n`Decimal('0.000504')` for `168` vbytes, or \r\n`Decimal('0.000501')` for `167` vbytes\r\n\r\nSo it seems like the fee rate won't be exact anymore unless i'm missing something. I feel like it might be a problem for some tests if `create_self_transfer` created transactions where the fee rate wasn't exactly the same as what was specified. \r\n\r\nIt's probably not an issue when no fee rate has been specified, but perhaps in the case where the user does specify a fee rate then the signature could be restricted to 71 bytes?",
