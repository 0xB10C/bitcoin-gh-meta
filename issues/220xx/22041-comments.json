      "body" : "Concept ACK\r\n\r\nThere is a trade-off here: making `--enable-suppress-external-warnings` the default will allow us to apply additional `-W` and `-Werror` options which will increase the likelihood of finding issues _local_ to our code base, and it will increase the signal to noise. OTOH doing so might reduce the likelihood of us finding issues in upstream code bases.\r\n\r\nSince we have to choose a default I think it makes sense to make the higher signal-to-noise alternative which focuses on local issues the default (`--enable-suppress-external-warnings`), and make `--disable-suppress-external-warnings` opt-in.",
