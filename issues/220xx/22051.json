While it permits importing `tr(KEY)`, anything beyond that is just laying foundations for more features later.\r\n\r\nMissing:\r\n* Signing support (see #21365)\r\n* Support for more interesting scripts inside the tree (only `pk(KEY)` is supported for now). In particular, a multisig policy based on the new `OP_CHECKSIGADD` opcode would be very useful.\r\n* Inferring `tr()` descriptors from outputs (given sufficient information).\r\n* `getaddressinfo` support.\r\n* MuSig support. Standardizing that is still an ongoing effort, and is generally kind of useless without corresponding PSBT support.\r\n* Convenient ways of constructing descriptors without spendable internal key (especially ones that arent't trivially recognizable as such).\r\n",
