   "body" : "This updates the third-party library nanobench with the latest release. It contains mostly minor bugfixes, a new pyperf output format, ability to suppress warnings with environment variable `NANOBENCH_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS`. Full changelog:\r\n\r\nv4.0.2\r\n* Changed `doNotOptimizeAway` to what google benchmark is doing. The old code did not work on some machines.\r\n* fix: display correct \"total\" value\r\n* minor Documentation updates\r\n\r\nv4.1.0\r\n* Updated link to new pyperf home\r\n* Adds ability to configure console output time unit\r\n*  Add support for environment variable `NANOBENCH_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS`\r\n* Nanobench is now usable with CMake's FetchContent (see documentation: https://nanobench.ankerl.com/tutorial.html#cmake-integration)\r\n\r\nv4.2.0\r\n* Ability to store and later compare results added, through `pyperf`.\r\n* See https://nanobench.ankerl.com/tutorial.html#pyperf-python-pyperf-module-output\r\n* Added lots of build targets to travis, similar to bitcoin's build.\r\n* Some minor API & documentation improvements\r\n\r\nv4.3.0\r\n* `ankerl::nanobench::Rng` can now return the state with `std::vector<uint64_t> Rng::state()`, and this can also be used to initialize the Rng.\r\n\r\nv4.3.1\r\n* Minor cmake improvements when integrationg as a third-party library: add alias `nanobench::nanobench`, default to C++17\r\n\r\nv4.3.2\r\n* Fixed a MSVC 2015 build problem\r\n* updates license to 2021.\r\n* build should now work with very old linux headers\r\n* Also disable UBSAN (bitcoin needed to add a suppression)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
