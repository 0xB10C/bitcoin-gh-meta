In the language used, labels are\r\n  associated with addresses, instead of addresses associated with labels. (unlike\r\n  with accounts.)\r\n- Labels have no balance\r\n  - No balances in `listlabels`\r\n  - `listlabels` has no minconf or watchonly argument\r\n- Like in the GUI, labels can be set on any address, not just receiving addreses\r\n- Unlike accounts, labels can be deleted.\r\n  Being unable to delete them is a common annoyance (see #1231).\r\n  Currently only by reassigning all addresses using `setlabel`, but an explicit\r\n  call `deletelabel` which assigns all address to the default label may make\r\n  sense.",
