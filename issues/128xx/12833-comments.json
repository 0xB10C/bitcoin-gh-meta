It's critical that `bitcoind` uses this second file (for settings like `prune`) and treats it the same as `bitcoin.conf`. So by the same reasoning it shouldn't write to that second file.\r\n\r\nAlso note that only QT needs this ability, so I could refactor it such that `bitcoind` daemon only has read-only access.\r\n\r\nI thought of a completely different approach to handle the `prune` case, so we might be able to kick this shared settings can down the road. Will open a PR for later.",
