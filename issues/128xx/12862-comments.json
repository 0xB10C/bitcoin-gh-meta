Confusion was caused by ```replaceable``` which can have non binary values.\r\n\r\n>  I also think all the filtering stuff is a mess, and there's probably no point adding to it\r\n\r\nI agree. However, there is no clear solution - either this needs to be marked as obsolete/to remove, or it needs to be updated when adding new output fields. Usually query is added when either:\r\n\r\n- Data extraction have additional cost that can be reduced querying beforehand. This is not the case here since the data needed is already extracted before applying query.\r\n- List is ever expanding. Again, this is not the case because list might change size depending on number of wallets and unused inputs. I would not expect this list to be too large to handle in the future.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to get additional opinion and potentially create an issue to remove query parameters. But as it stands now the proper way to add new output fields is to add them in query as well to be consistent with intentions of this method.",
