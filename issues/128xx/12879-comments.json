Better let Travis take care of finding trivial mechanical issues via the lint script so that human reviewers can focus on the important higher level stuff.\r\n\r\nThe lint script is already written, it is really easy to read and the logic is so simple that the script is very unlikely to generate false positives or any maintenance burden going forward.

There's no risk that a redundant 'extern' causes any actual bugs. It doesn't even cause confusion to developers reading the code.\r\n\r\nThat's kind of the point, in a way. Using `extern` when you don't need to has no side effects, which means a lot of people think they have to use it. By forbidding it in new code, we free up time from reviewing other people who come in later to \"fix\" the problem. It's trivial to fix and perhaps even delightfully educational.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke \r\n\r\n> I'd also suggest to get rid of the scripted diff, it is easier to review without having to also review the scripted diff.\r\n\r\nI thought scripted diffs were implemented to make it *easier* to review, as you have an anchor in code that defines what you are changing. Is that not why they exist?\r\n",
