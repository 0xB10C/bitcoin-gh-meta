Having an empty `blocks` dir with just and `index` subdir is a bit weird. Perhaps after @jimpo's #11857 is merged, we could just move / assume all indexes to be there (if `-blocksdir` is set)?\r\n\r\nWorse, it created a directory `/Users/bitcoin/blocks/blocks`, which seems like a bug. I had to set `blocksdir=/Users/bitcoin` instead.",
