      "body" : "This seems like a good thing to support, but maybe it would be cleaner to use password authentication instead of cookie authentication here. Cookies being secrets chosen by the server, and passwords being secrets chosen externally. But if not getting caught up in cookie/password semantics, we could add a `-rpccookiegenerate`/`-norpccookiegenerate` boolean option defaulting to true, to toggle between either generating the cookie internally or allowing a cookie value to be specified externally. I think adding an option to use external cookies would be better than automatically trusting read-only cookie files, which might be created unintentionally or maliciously.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion to solve the immediate problem of using bitcoin and electrs with docker secrets: maybe you could have docker generate `/run/secrets/bitcoin_password` and have a startup script include it in electrs and bitcoind configurations (bitcoin `-includeconf` option might be useful here).\r\n",
