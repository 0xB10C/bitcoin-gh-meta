We've seen way too many recent UUM issues in the last two years.\r\n\r\n> It doesn't add a lot of value: Except for one issue in the boost time library, it hasn't found any issues that the existing fuzz,asan,ubsan fuzzer has already found\r\n\r\nPlease note that UUM issues will **not** be found by ASan or UBSan: only MSan or Valgrind will catch these.\r\n\r\n> It is redundant: It is already run in the bitcoin-core/qa-assets repo on every push of new seeds and once daily\r\n\r\nIt is great that you run the this testing on your own, but \"I run this anyways on my own intrastructure\" is really not equivalent to \"everyone can easily confirm that we test this continuously in our shared CI infrastructure\".",
