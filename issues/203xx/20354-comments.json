While there is a way to \"remove\" the taproot code at runtime with the `vbparams` option, there is currently no formal proof that none of the taproot code is executed at runtime. It was unknown if the new taproot code influences the test result of this test in any way.\r\n\r\nThe subtest checks that taproot is a softfork, i.e. nodes without the taproot code can still sync with the network at a small cost of missing some consensus checks. As said, `vbparams` can be used to disable the taproot code. A cleaner approach is to run the test against a previously released version of a full node that isn't aware of taproot.\r\n\r\nYou can run the test manually with the `--previous_release` or via the test_runner's built-in list.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test `-vbparams` outside of what the test does, you can pass it as an option to Bitcoin Core.",
