      "body" : "A useful follow-on to this PR, since loading unordered blocks would become possible, might be the addition of a `-loadblocksdir=` argument that takes a directory path and loads all blocks found in the directory. That way it's not necessary to specify a very large number of `-loadblock` arguments. It would then be easy to import an entire blockchain. \r\n\r\nAnother way to accomplish approximately the same thing would be to replace the entire `blocks` directory in the data directory and then `-reindex`. But using `-loadblocksdir` would allow you to \"merge\" blocks into your existing blocks list (suppressing duplicates), which is kind of cool.",
