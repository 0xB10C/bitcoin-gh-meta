One of them is:\r\n\r\n> Note that for `*block` topics, when the block chain tip changes, a reorganisation may occur and just the tip will be notified. It is up to the subscriber to retrieve the chain from the last known block to the new tip. Also note that no notification will occur if the tip was in the active chain--as would be the case after calling `invalidateblock` RPC. In contrast, the sequence topic publishes all block connections and disconnections.\r\n\r\nBased on the documentation I'd say that `...c346cd` was not published is expected behavior. \r\n",
