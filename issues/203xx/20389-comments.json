This is an unfortunate side effect of the gitian build system which should be solved by the [move to guix](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/13).\r\n\r\nI examined the differences in the compiled binary using [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/) and it's basically just a few bytes that changed resulting in different hashes. The specific changes were in the extra debug data that is generated, which resulted in a different debug data checksum. As the debug data checksum is embedded in the final binary (which has debugging data stripped), the build id is also different, and the final result is that the final binary hash is also different.",
