After doing so, all my transactions from before January 2014 had a date of January 2014.\r\n\r\nUpon checking the source code, I see this line in ```CWallet::AddToWallet()``` in ```wallet/wallet.cpp```:\r\n\r\n    wtx.nTimeSmart = std::max(latestEntry, std::min(blocktime, latestNow));\r\n\r\n`blocktime` is the time I want to see in my transactions, `latestNow` is much bigger, and so the `min()` returns the time I want, but `latestEntry` is January 2014, and so that's the time that is used for all my old transactions.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely clear how the Jan 2014 date is being found, since `-zapwallettxes` is meant to delete all the transactions and rescan to find them again, but it seems that\r\n\r\n    TxItems txOrdered = OrderedTxItems(acentries);\r\n\r\nis finding a transaction from 2014, even after all transactions have been deleted.\r\n\r\nI tried replacing the nTimeSmart = max(min()) code with this:\r\n\r\n    wtx.nTimeSmart = std::min(blocktime, latestNow);\r\n\r\nthen re-ran with the -zap flag, and now I see the correct dates next to all of my transactions.",
