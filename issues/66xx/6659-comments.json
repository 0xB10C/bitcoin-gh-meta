      "body" : "Hi!  Thanks for your interest in working on this! Have you benchmarked these changes?  We have caching in verification which I expect would moot most performance gains here. (As the transaction enters the mempool the verification cache is primed, and the transaction is a hit when it shows up in a block).\r\n\r\nOne reason we have not previously done this is because doing so imports the mempool bugs into the consensus of the system.  There have previously been bugs that, e.g. caused transactions to fail to be removed from the mempool when they should have.  Not a reason to preclude doing this, but if there isn't a performance gain over the pre-existing caching approach then the reduced isolation may not be a win.\r\n",
