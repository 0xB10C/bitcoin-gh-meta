      "body" : "The top transaction that was having the display issue exposed a bit about my privacy (as all my transactions are labeled), so I just did a new transaction, assuming it would now have the display issue (as I assumed it was an issue only with the newest transaction). However, the line/transaction having the issue simply moved down one on the list.\r\n\r\nI then realized I could change the label on the transaction in question (to protect my privacy), so that's what I did.\r\n\r\nBottom line, the display issue seemed to stick with the 8/15/15 transaction, it didn't stay at the top. Please let me know if you need more info.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2015-09-02 at 5 34 03 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4542126/9631243/7096030c-5134-11e5-8d4f-b0b44c759a9d.png)",
