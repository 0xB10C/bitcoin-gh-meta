Main repository is currently https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue.\r\nUniValue's test are currently not included in `make check`, only the already existing `test/univalue_tests.cpp` are included.\r\nThis is because of a recently added coupling between univalue and bitcoin-core.(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c02309204b8195476945f7066e8d96c60246db08) \r\n\r\nNot sure if i have done this right. Maybe @theuni could have a look at it.\r\nIt could make sense to add a UniValue repository to github/bitcoin.",
