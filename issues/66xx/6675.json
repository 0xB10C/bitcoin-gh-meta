   "body" : "It was noted on #bitcoin-dev that many simplifications arise from removing the complex, dual-policy aspects of priority-based low fee transactions on policy estimation, block template creation and mempool code. This change updates Bitcoin Core to relay purely based on fee/kb rate, removing the concepts of priority and free transactions from the codebase.\r\n\r\nfSendFreeTransactions, fLimitFree and similar controls have been operating in the field defaulting to fee-based choices already.\r\n\r\nThis change should make other changes such as @pstratem 's work to cap the mempool size dynamically much easier.\r\n\r\nAn example implementation exists (#6405) at https://github.com/jgarzik/bitcoin/tree/2015_remove_tx_priority\r\nwith the following notes/caveats:\r\n\r\nStatus:\r\n* A large change, lightly tested\r\n* Transaction fee deltas are preserved - thus TX \"priority\" remains to some extent\r\n* Arbitrary policies may be implemented via fee deltas\r\n* prioritisetransaction RPC call continues to work, by adjusting the fee.\r\n* needs focused review in the area of wallet, to ensure IsMine() transactions work fine through reorgs\r\n",
