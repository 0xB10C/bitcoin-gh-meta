It is included in both #6382 and #5970 anyway so it won't be lost, but having it synchronized in both branches plus an independent one is more annoying than it needs to be. BIP102, for example, can be maintained on top of #6382 instead.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time, if it is unlikely that it gets merged for 0.12 as it is, It would be very nice to at least create another one with the 2 or 3 commits that are suitable for 0.12 and keep maintaining the rest just as part of #6382 and #5970, at least until 0.12 is forked.",
