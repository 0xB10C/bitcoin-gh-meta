      "body" : "No I'm not referring to a security issue, just functional and\nperformance related.\n\nWhat is happening is that the nodes are getting hung when large numbers\nof blocks are getting downloaded.  I see this clearly when running the\nwallet.py test and it happens 50% of the time I run that test.   I've\nverified this on both win32 and win64 workstations.   What is seen is\nthat at some point the client sends a getdata but the other node never\nreceives the request and it always happens when a large number of blocks\nhas to sync (such as mining 100 blocks during the wallet.py test).  That\nby itself could be a number of things, and I've run down quite a few\nrabbit trails to no avail, but when I then increase the buffer size the\nproblem goes away.  I wish I could see the traffic in the network\nsniffer but on Windows we can't monitor the loopback adapter with\nWireShark.   So I think it's a logical deduction that the buffer is\ngetting full. \n\nThe bigger problem though in my mind is that send buffers should not be\ngetting full to begin with.  There should be some handling in the code\nto check the buffer has room before data is sent down the pipe to\nprevent hangups, but I don't know the code base yet well enough to see\nif that is already being done and just not working properly, or whether\nit needs to be added.\n\nRegardless, the default 8KB Windows socket buffer is far too small (I\nreally don't understand why they still have kept it that low, I think\nsince windows 95).  Mac has a 64KB buffer default and I would expect\nLinux probably does also.  The bigger the buffer the more throughput is\npossible and hence better performance: Throughput = Buffersize/latency. \n\n\n\nOn 18/09/2015 8:09 AM, Wladimir J. van der Laan wrote:\n>\n> Is this a security issue?\n>\n> I don't really know windows networking internals, but in which\n> circumstances can a client flood this buffer?

So using 8KB send, 8KB Receive, the test fails,  using 8KB send, 16KB receive the test also fails, using 8KB send and 64KB receive, the test passes.  It seems more likely the problem is on the receiving end, also noting that when the test fails a getdata is sent and a log entry made, but never received at the other end.  After reviewing the code I also don't see anything in the send data code that is cause for alarm. However, I'll still add the logprint entries and see if anything comes out of it.

Only when the receive buffer is changed to 64KB does the problem go away and the test pass.  I'm wondering if there is a problem with how truncated data is handled on the receiving end , as would happen with a  receive buffer overflow?\r\n\r\n1)  disabled optimistic sending.  No change in the test.  We still fail at exactly the same place.\r\n\r\n2) made the send socket a blocking socket, which according to Microsoft would fix the issue of a delayed ACK. So, delayed ACKing is not the cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nMethod 1: Use Blocking Sockets\r\nThis problem only occurs with non-blocking sockets. When you use a blocking socket, this problem does not occur because Afd.sys handles the socket buffer differently. For more information about blocking and non-blocking socket programming, see the Microsoft Platform SDK documentation.",

      "body" : "@theuni   Cory, here's yet another bit of code that fixes or masks the issue, we don't really need to be sleeping if we've just sent messages, rather we should be checking the receive queue for anything that's been coming back.  So now we have 3 different code changes, all performance enhancements, which on their own I think would be beneficial but none of them gets to the root of the problem.\r\n\r\n- g_signals.SendMessages(pnode, pnode == pnodeTrickle || pnode->fWhitelisted);\r\n+ if(g_signals.SendMessages(pnode, pnode == pnodeTrickle || pnode->fWhitelisted))\r\n+       fSleep = false;\r\n\r\nOne other thing I found today, which may be just another rabbit trail, but may also be nearer to the root of the problem is that we seem to be receiving a great many blocks that we've never requested!  In the logs of the nodes that fail to sync I see this pattern:\r\n\r\n137 blocks requested\r\n185 blocks downloaded\r\n203 blocks are actually in the database however when we RPC them we only see 119.\r\n\r\nSo it appears that all blocks \"have\" been downloaded and sync'd somehow, but are not showing up in the logs as downloaded and they can't be counted by RPC'ing and getting a block count.  And now that I think of it that was one of the original observations at the beginning of the issue 6554 thread.  \r\n\r\nI'll keep digging...\r\n",
