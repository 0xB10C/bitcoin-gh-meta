There is one in-code TODO I have to resolve (it is minor, but it has to be improved)\r\n3. I add unit and functional tests for these features.\r\n\r\nAnother task is to sync [parent PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21515) with this version. I have a local branch that compiles, but tests of the full Erlay there needs a little care. If you want to see how this PR works in the broader context, the parent should be good enough to get it. Otherwise, I intend to update it soon.",
