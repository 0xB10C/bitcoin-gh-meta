I don't think having the option (again, *default false*) can directly cause a full RBF network, and likewise, I don't think removing this option removes the \"risk\" of a full RBF network. Said \"risk\" is also a misunderstanding, but that's a different conversation. AFAIK Bitcoin Core isn't doing any \"advertising\" or encouraging users to use this config option, it just exists. Any user that wanted full RBF (e.g. because they want more fees) for the past 7 years could have run a patch or Knots or something else.",

Social inertia being what it is, I think zero conf services operators have few months of buffer before there is effective full-rbf transaction-relay paths. Moreover it would require few miners turning on `mempoolfullrbf`. In anyway, from my understanding the operational risk sounds low enough to not justify neutralizing #25353, which would have the downside to set a low-grounded precedent in our release process.",

      "body" : "On the argument the mempoolfullrbf setting may significantly increase the risk exposure of 0confs applications and service, I believe it should be weighed in the light of two factors. The first, most of 0confs applications and services announce to have additional layers of security to protect themselves against double-spends attempts [0]. AFAIU, they should provide some security against conflicting transactions, even in the presence of full-rbf nodes. The second, I empathize for the affected 0confs services/users though delaying or freezing the progress on full-rbf deployment isn't free of security consequences for contracting protocols and multi-party applications. We could have tomorrow all the coinjoins implementations censor without that much countermeasures at the client-level, at the exception of setting private-relay to miners. Lastly, in the presence of a well-reviewed and functional patch already deployed, \"the cat is already out of the bag\", in the sense of a miner motivated to enable full rbf would have minimal engineering effort to do so. As of today, from my  understanding, engineering barriers are at the equilibrium, reverting the mempoolfullrbf setting would be more like the Bitcoin Core project throwing social opprobium on the usage. And I don't think we're all agree on here.\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021112.html\r\n\r\nOn the second argument, while all the interdependency risks where not raised in the public discussion, especially the FX risk, the immediate concerns on 0confs applications have been underscored. Even if the full depth and width were uncertain from a protocol dev viewpoint, it should be recalled some dimensions are application specific. It is yet unclear what should be the risk scope in the design considerations of Bitcoin Core development (i.e \"Is FX risk better solved at this layer, or in which proportion ?\"). \r\n\r\nOn the third argument, it should be noted current patch doesn't deprecate opt-in rbf as such, and the spirit design of this patch and #25600 were to offer the flexibility to the node operators to \"vote\" with their economic traffic. Indeed, in a presence of a \"split\" situation, where we have two classes of use-cases with conflicting policy requirements we might have to consider out of the sphere of Bitcoin Core decision-making what should be the policy default. If we have rough consensus on full-rbf itself, though we have more in the process of converging on a deprecation timeline, I think the conversation should be rather pursued on the mailing list or during meetings.",

      "body" : "Thank y'all for the replies!\r\n\r\n@glozow \r\n\r\n> I understand this argument theoretically, but haven't found any evidence suggesting that any miner will do so and on what timescale. I've been trying to ask miners what they plan to do wrt full RBF but haven't had much luck so far. Will keep trying.\r\n\r\nThank you for attempting to query miners!  Let's imagine every miner replied \"no, we don't plan to enable full RBF this release cycle\".  What could we do to support that decision and also provide additional assurance to services that currently expect first-seen-safe behavior?  I think there are two options:\r\n\r\n1. This PR, temporarily disable `mempoolfullrbf` for mainchain\r\n2. Disable the `getblocktemplate` RPC on any node that has `mempoolfullrbf` set to true\r\n\r\n> The only thing evident to me so far is that miners employ the policy they want, even if it means running a patch instead of Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nThat's their right, of course, and I'd personally be happy to see them enabling full RBF on their own.  I know some miners have done that in the past, most notably f2pool in 2015 IIRC.\r\n\r\nI think an essential part of this issue is that Bitcoin Core should give appropriate notice to affected users when making changes that have a reasonable chance of disrupting existing operations.  We haven't provided that notice for 24.x, and to actually provide that notice and maintain our high degree of professionalism and regard for users, all we need to do is wait six months for 25.x.\r\n\r\n> if miners want to use full RBF and do, mempools requiring signaling will blind their users to higher-feerate replacements, potentially causing them to get double-spent. And so I imagine we'd need to emergency-add a -mempoolfullrbf option then. That's one of the reasons I think it makes more sense to keep the option than not.\r\n\r\nIn addition to what @ajtowns wrote, if all we wanted to do is notify users that replacements might be circulating, we could probably pass the list of conflicting transactions when the `txn-mempool-conflict` error is sent via `-debug=mempoolrej`.  That way anyone could receive notification about double spends being relayed by their peers.\r\n\r\n> Given that the risk is speculative, would one solution be to add a \"use caution!\" to the helpstring, or warn when a user changes the default? Or add a section in the release notes?\r\n\r\nThe people at risk aren't the people enabling the option, so I'm not sure changes to the helpstring or logging help.  We should certainly provide a detailed release note about this situation no matter what action (or inaction) we decide to take.\r\n\r\n@luke-jr\r\n\r\n> Erecting artificial barriers to prevent or make it difficult for users to do what they want to do, is not appropriate behaviour.\r\n\r\nI agree in principle, but I also don't think it's appropriate to potentially undermine the operations of some of our users because we're unwilling to announce our intent six months in advance, as we have done historically.\r\n\r\n@ariard \r\n\r\n> most of 0confs applications and services announce to have additional layers of security to protect themselves against double-spends attempts [0]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the email you linked only describes countermeasures against separate propagation of conflicting transactions and that those countermeasures would be ineffectual against a replacement that was sent more than a few seconds after the original transaction.\r\n\r\n> I empathize for the affected 0confs services/users though delaying or freezing the progress on full-rbf deployment isn't free of security consequences for contracting protocols and multi-party applications.\r\n\r\nIf removing this option will significantly delay or freeze the progress of full-RBF deployment, that seems to me to be a statement that you believe zero-conf services are at increased risk, which I think conflicts with statements made by several reviewers on the original PR about this being, \"uncontroversial, given that the default is 'unchanged'\".\r\n\r\nAgain, if we are changing a policy that users and businesses rely on, we should strive to provide advance warning.\r\n\r\n> a miner motivated to enable full rbf would have minimal engineering effort to do so\r\n\r\nPatches for enabling full RBF have been available since at least 2015 and have even previously been deployed by miners.  That's fine; zero-conf services and those worried about free options have always been exposed to that risk.  But just because others *can* break an existing system doesn't mean that we should treat it as broken now.\r\n\r\n> reverting the mempoolfullrbf setting would be more like the Bitcoin Core project throwing social opprobium on the usage. And I don't think we're all agree on here.\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to worry about people misinterpreting our actions when we can explain what we're doing, and why we're doing it, in the 24.0 release notes.\r\n\r\n> On the second argument, while all the interdependency risks where not raised in the public discussion, especially the FX risk, the immediate concerns on 0confs applications have been underscored. Even if the full depth and width were uncertain from a protocol dev viewpoint, it should be recalled some dimensions are application specific. It is yet unclear what should be the risk scope in the design considerations of Bitcoin Core development (i.e \"Is FX risk better solved at this layer, or in which proportion ?\").\r\n\r\nI read the above as you agreeing that reviewers were unaware of all the risks when they gave their ACKs.  If that's the case, I don't see why it's a matter of significant debate to partially revert this *unreleased* PR so that it can be reconsidered with all of its consequences made explicit.\r\n\r\n> On the third argument, it should be noted current patch doesn't deprecate opt-in rbf as such\r\n\r\nThis patch makes it possible for people running unmodified Bitcoin Core to change a longstanding network policy that is used by multiple businesses serving thousands of users.  Whether that's technically deprecation or not, I think it warrants giving businesses a warning about the impending change.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAll: I think it would be a credit to the project and to ourselves if we remove this option for just the 24.x series and take the next six months to explain what we plan to do and how it may affect users and business.  That additionally gives us time to consider the new information we've received and potentially use it to improve the deployment of full RBF (e.g. I think #26323's simultaneous activation of full-RBF is much nicer than an uncoordinated deployment, such as in maximizing the efficiency of compact block filters and erlay).",

For example, we pick some block time 3 years in the future that will be checked into the codebase for 25.0+, then if we get later feedback that 3 years is too much for merchants, we can move it up, optionally, before 25.0 release.\r\n\r\nSorry if this sounds like horse trading, but there has to be a stronger motivation for removing user choices, *especially* when the time horizon to restoring them is unbounded.",

Personally I often test things not covered by unit tests on mainnet. So taking this option away is annoying.\n\nSecondly, disabling this option for mainnet sets a dangerous precedent that 1) zeroconf transactions have a degree of safety, and 2) we're responsible for that safety.\n\nMuun created their reckless reliance on zero conf years after the dangers of it were widely understood.

      "body" : "Thank you @harding for helping trying to make progress here.\r\n\r\nFirst let me comment on two of your points:\r\n\r\n> There's a reasonable argument that the inclusion of the option may significantly change network behavior in a way that would be harmful to some current users. Specifically, that it only takes one large mining pool with a publicly known IP to enable full RBF to make it practical to replace any pending transaction.\r\n\r\nI don't think the argument is that reasonable. I buy the part that it would then realistically be easier / more reasonable for a mining pool to enable RBF for all transactions. Even though as Antoine notes i'm not convinced removing the option would make it substantially harder for them since they can just apply the well reviewed a7f3479ba3fda4c9fb29bd7080165744c02ee921 patch on top of the release.\r\nI don't buy the part that it's substantially safer to accept unconfirmed transactions as final today, due to some magic protection mechanism in place (and apparently closed source? Has anyone seen it and could vouch for its efficiency, that non-signaling RBF would break?).\r\n\r\n> so it's possible some or all of its ACKs were based on an incomplete consideration of its consequences\r\n\r\nMine was based on the correctness of the code plus the consequences:\r\n- As a software project we don't take side in the \"gentleman agreement\" (is there any or is it just blind trust?) between businesses relying on first-seen-safe and miners of not replacing non BIP125-signaling transactions: we just provide the option to do both.\r\n- The default for that option is conservatively set to the previous behaviour of the node. There is a reasonable argument that setting the default to `true` would significantly affect the network, and i don't think it should be our call.\r\n\r\nTherefore the PR seemed pretty reasonable to me and that's why i ACKed it.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThat (and another [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26323#issuecomment-1290193994)) said. releasing a software that could, potentially, supposedly, play a (small) role in breaking a substantial part of users of the Bitcoin network without them being apparently aware in advance [0] seems just wrong. And opposed to the philosophy of this project.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, and even though treating unconfirmed transactions as final is insane, releasing an anti-feature that purposefully prevents a valid usage of the node (and that goes against the incentives of some users of the network) not something we should do, ACK fa1fff466d6f05b00bf97ccf571b7c440734ad6b for 24.0 only (ie provided we immediately revert it on master).\r\n\r\n[0] I don't know how we could communicate to end users better really. Antoine has been exemplary in trying to motivate, explain, and champion \"full\" RBF to affected stakeholders. And what we are reverting isn't even some \"full\" RBF activation on the network but an option to a perfectly valid usage of a Bitcoin node.",

      "body" : "I retract my NACK from above, but I would like to elaborate my stance on full-RBF in light of the continued discussion:\r\n1. First-seen safety for transaction not signaling replaceability relies on the unstable gentlemen's agreement that _all_ miners continue adhering to a social convention that is technically unenforceable.\r\n2. Treating unconfirmed transactions as reliable is a bad business practice that should be discouraged and preferably end sooner rather than later. The continued development of software that relies on this false assumption is detrimental to the network.\r\n3. Apparently some senders publicly promising that they will not attempt replacement provides a valuable social signal to some receivers, sufficient for said receivers to treat such transaction in a different, more risky manner.\r\n6. Propping up the illusion of non-replaceable transactions complicates development of multi-party protocols. Converging on the inevitable modus operandi sooner rather than later reduces effort spent on dead-end business practices.\r\n5. It is inevitable that full-RBF will eventually emerge on the network. When this comes about, Bitcoin Core users should have the option to align their mempool content with the expected mined blocks.\r\n4. Even in the presence of the `mempoolfullrbf` startup option and eventual adoption of full RBF on the network, some senders may continue promising non-replacement and receivers may continue extending unbacked credit on basis of such promises. This may be rational, since not paying after receiving service is theft and most people do not engage in theft.\r\n7. Miners have had the option to enact full-RBF by running alternative clients or a one-line patch for years, yet we do not see significant hashrate that engages in full-RBF. I would similarly expect miners to shy away from turning on `mempoolfullrbf`, to deliberately bring about the end of the gentlemen's agreement. It is reasonable to expect the situation to remain in its unstable equilibrium for the time being until some miner perceives some significant advantage or spurious reason to doing away with it.\r\n8. I am open to removing the `mempoolfullrbf` option in the 24.0 release in the interest of more explicitly providing advance notice in light of the concerns brought forth by businesses under the condition that the `mempoolfullrbf` option is released with 25.0.\r\n\r\nI will continue to discourage the practice of accepting unconfirmed transactions (â0-confâ), encourage businesses to transition to full-RBF-compatible practices, advocate for all transactions to be labeled as replaceable by default at transaction creation, will run `mempoolfullrbf=1` myself, but will not lobby miners to adopt `mempoolfullrbf=1` in the foreseeable future.",

So it's in my interest to avoid them happening by accident. joy More likely is that the double spends at pools previously observed to not be running full rbf are due to miners changing configurations. Eg restarting nodes, starting new nodes, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are only two txs listed on https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org/ as not paying 182sats, namely: https://mempool.space/tx/3949f06019fd6acb95184a6667309f4c5b045f296667019e1d8b421547831418 and https://mempool.space/tx/0f1c7b57b9e95bf84b6a2f5462dfeb7284e404dcfd1b49a95967f5e794808b66 . Looking at miningpool.observer's entry for the corresponding blocks, I'm not seeing any conflicting transactions reported https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000003509625dbe8c7671a7810ebe2250c8327bf5b4f845d89 https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/0000000000000000000371542c63451b800697125fa8f7f4c65e46b1c857f7d9 (and the txs aren't listed as missing/extra at all). That suggests pretty strongly to me that any earlier versions of those txs failed to propogate to both the miner (Foundry/f2pool) and miningpool.observer (and probably the rest of the network), rather than the miner using fullrbf logic to accept the replacement, or having missed txs due to a losing their mempool/restarting their node.",
