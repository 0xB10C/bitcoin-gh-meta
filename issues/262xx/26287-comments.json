I don't think having the option (again, *default false*) can directly cause a full RBF network, and likewise, I don't think removing this option removes the \"risk\" of a full RBF network. Said \"risk\" is also a misunderstanding, but that's a different conversation. AFAIK Bitcoin Core isn't doing any \"advertising\" or encouraging users to use this config option, it just exists. Any user that wanted full RBF (e.g. because they want more fees) for the past 7 years could have run a patch or Knots or something else.",

Social inertia being what it is, I think zero conf services operators have few months of buffer before there is effective full-rbf transaction-relay paths. Moreover it would require few miners turning on `mempoolfullrbf`. In anyway, from my understanding the operational risk sounds low enough to not justify neutralizing #25353, which would have the downside to set a low-grounded precedent in our release process.",

      "body" : "On the argument the mempoolfullrbf setting may significantly increase the risk exposure of 0confs applications and service, I believe it should be weighed in the light of two factors. The first, most of 0confs applications and services announce to have additional layers of security to protect themselves against double-spends attempts [0]. AFAIU, they should provide some security against conflicting transactions, even in the presence of full-rbf nodes. The second, I empathize for the affected 0confs services/users though delaying or freezing the progress on full-rbf deployment isn't free of security consequences for contracting protocols and multi-party applications. We could have tomorrow all the coinjoins implementations censor without that much countermeasures at the client-level, at the exception of setting private-relay to miners. Lastly, in the presence of a well-reviewed and functional patch already deployed, \"the cat is already out of the bag\", in the sense of a miner motivated to enable full rbf would have minimal engineering effort to do so. As of today, from my  understanding, engineering barriers are at the equilibrium, reverting the mempoolfullrbf setting would be more like the Bitcoin Core project throwing social opprobium on the usage. And I don't think we're all agree on here.\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021112.html\r\n\r\nOn the second argument, while all the interdependency risks where not raised in the public discussion, especially the FX risk, the immediate concerns on 0confs applications have been underscored. Even if the full depth and width were uncertain from a protocol dev viewpoint, it should be recalled some dimensions are application specific. It is yet unclear what should be the risk scope in the design considerations of Bitcoin Core development (i.e \"Is FX risk better solved at this layer, or in which proportion ?\"). \r\n\r\nOn the third argument, it should be noted current patch doesn't deprecate opt-in rbf as such, and the spirit design of this patch and #25600 were to offer the flexibility to the node operators to \"vote\" with their economic traffic. Indeed, in a presence of a \"split\" situation, where we have two classes of use-cases with conflicting policy requirements we might have to consider out of the sphere of Bitcoin Core decision-making what should be the policy default. If we have rough consensus on full-rbf itself, though we have more in the process of converging on a deprecation timeline, I think the conversation should be rather pursued on the mailing list or during meetings.",
