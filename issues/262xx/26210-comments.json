      "body" : "I'm not sure about this. I think maybe there could be some benefit doing this for ZMQ and peerman. But it also could make ZMQ and peerman implementations messier. A problem with shared_ptr is it can spread virally. Since shared_ptr classes can have unpredictable extended lifetimes, any external state they point to also might need to have extended lifetimes, so any plain pointers or references they contain might need to be converted into shared_ptrs.\r\n\r\nFor indexes, instead of making all indexes into shared_ptrs (which would not be a completely trivial change just because all the index init code for 3 index subclasses that needs to be updated), I would really prefer not to make this change because I already implemented code in #24230 to switch from `RegisterValidationInterface` to `RegisterSharedValidationInterface` without needing to make the indexes themselves shared_ptrs. Combined with #24230 this would leave the indexes as shared_ptrs without an actual reason for them to be shared_ptrs.",
