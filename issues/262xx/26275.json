   "body" : "This PR is a proposal for fixing #26274 (better described there).\r\n\r\nThe problem is due to a signed int wrapping when the `index` parameter of the `deriveaddresses` RPC call has the value `2^31-1`.\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nfor (int i = range_begin; i <= range_end; ++i) {\r\n```\r\n\r\n* the first commit adds a \"temporary\" test case (`test/functional/rpc_deriveaddresses_crash.py`) that shows the crash, and can be used to generate a core dump;\r\n* the second commit fixes the problem giving an explicit size to the `i` variable in a for loop, from `int` to `int64_t`. The same commit also removes the ephemeral test case and adds a passing test to `test/functional/rpc_deriveaddresses.py`, in order to prevent future regressions.\r\n\r\nThis is my first submission to this project and I do not know its conventions. Please advise if something needs to be changed.\r\n",
