      "body" : "I think something should be done about the inconsistency of having `libbitcoin_common.a` source files outside of the `src/common/` and this is one possible option. Other possible options are:\r\n\r\n1. Move `src/interface/` files to a `libbitcoin_interfaces.a` library\r\n2. Delete `src/interface/*.cpp` files and make `src/interfaces/` directory only contain headers\r\n\r\nI think I like these options a little better, because they would keep source structure flat and avoid too much nesting. They would also avoid namespace inconsistencies or the need to have a nested `common::interfaces::` namespace that would make function declarations in headers more verbose.\r\n\r\nI want look into option 2 a little more since it seems like the 3 .cpp files in the interfaces directory are very minimal and don't contain much real code.",

I thought it to be a preferable option because it seemed a cleaner way to achieve our goal.\r\nHowever, on second thought, what if we need to expand `src/interfaces` in the future for some reason, and going with a header-only route for the expansion might be unreasonable? So we might have to move to an option similar to your first suggestion.\r\n\r\nThis might be an infeasible scenario, and there might exist other options than the two you mentioned to achieve this goal, which I haven't considered. But I just wanted to explain why I think the second option, though cleaner, might not be feasible in the long run.",
