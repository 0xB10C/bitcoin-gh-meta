   "body" : "These belong in `libbitcoin_common.a`, not `libbitcoin_util.a`, because they aren't general-purpose utilities, they just contain some common glue code that is used by both the node and the wallet. Another reason not to include these in `libbitcoin_util.a` is to prevent them from being used by the kernel library.\r\n\r\nAlso rename ambiguous `MakeHandler` functions to `MakeCleanupHandler` and `MakeSignalHandler`. Cleanup function handler was introduced after boost signals handler, so original naming didn't make much sense.\r\n\r\nThis just contains a move-only commit, and a rename commit. There are no actual code or behavior changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative to #26293, and solves the same issue of removing a boost dependency from the _util_ library. The advantages of this PR compared to #26293 are that it keeps the source directory structure more flat, and it avoids having to change #includes all over the codebase.",
