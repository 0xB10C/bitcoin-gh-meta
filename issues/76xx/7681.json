This means that not even critical security updates are being released anymore. This makes it dangerous to run a wallet on this OS.\r\n\r\nThere are also some strange, apparently random crashes on WinXP with 0.12, see #7674 and #7639.\r\n\r\nI haven't heard of any reports of this happening on other versions of windows.\r\n\r\nI hope it is possible to debug and fix this, but if not, and it turns out to be truly a WinXP only issue, we'll have to announce this through the appropriate channels.",
