   "body" : "(updated with new information)\r\nCalculation of the transaction fee when \"paytxfee\" is set has changed, without announcement or documentation.\r\n\r\nPer @sipa :\r\n```In earlier versions however the size of a transaction was rounded up to a\r\nmultiple of 1000, as that is how the mining code used to sort transaction\r\nyears ago. In 0.12, it was finally changed to the accurate formula that\r\nworks at an accuracy per byte. If the paytxfee value was always exactly\r\nwhat you saw as resulting fee, that must mean all your transactions were 1\r\nkB in size.```\r\n\r\nIn bitcoin.conf, I had\r\n\r\n`paytxfee=0.0001`\r\n\r\nIn 0.11, that meant that BTC 0.0001 would be added to every outbound tx as a fee.\r\n\r\nin 0.12, it means every tx will have added to it a fee of BTC 0.0001 **per kilobyte**\r\n\r\n**This is not documented in the release notes.** As a result of this, I've got 3 days worth of spend transactions caught in unconfirmed limbo, having gone out with fees like 0.00002260 instead of 0.0001.",
