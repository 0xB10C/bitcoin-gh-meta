In a sense, the transaction eviction algorithm for the mempool is already assuming we're doing something like what this PR implements for transaction selection, in that a transaction is less likely to be evicted from the mempool if its feerate with descendants is high.  But more fundamentally, mempool eviction is just a different problem than transaction selection: when selecting transactions for a block, a candidate transaction's ancestors must be included (so it's natural to sort by feerate-with-ancestors), but when considering a transaction for mempool eviction, a candidate transaction's descendants must also be removed as well (so we use `max(feerate, feerate with descendants)` as our sort order for removal).\r\n",
