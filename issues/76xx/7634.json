   "body" : "Hi , I upgrade bitcoin core to 0.12 , but 0.12 default tx fee too low to slow confirm transaction (tx fee => 0.00002260 without set mintxfee [0.11.2 : paytxfee , 0.12 : mintxfee]) ... like this\r\n\r\nhttp://block.oklink.com/btc/tx/9d59d22c9c2e1a703dfafd215bf1c0eb63bc583539bcc66b6003d43cebad40d8\r\n\r\nand the transaction is too slow and reject from blockchain.org : [[ Transaction rejected by our node. Reason: Transaction was previously accepted but has been pruned from our database. ]]\r\n\r\nand I fixed mintxfee and downgrade to 0.11.2 , now okay for another transactions , but is possible fast to confirm the transaction like use miner software to assign the transaction or add more txfee ? ( ...... same blockchain BTCs all been sent ... )",
