At least not traditionally on UNIX systems, maybe some of the newer ones are incorrectly making that distinction.\r\n\r\nDaemons usually fork to run in their own user/group - as apache (httpd), named, and bitcoind do - from a service script that is started by root. And they traditionally go into an `sbin` directory so that a user who might want to execute the command `bitcoin-cli` or `bitcoin-tx` doesn't have `bitcoind` in their path.",
