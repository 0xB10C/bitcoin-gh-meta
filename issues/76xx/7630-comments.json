Here's the relevant comment for it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n                // Always relay transactions received from whitelisted peers, even\r\n                // if they were already in the mempool or rejected from it due\r\n                // to policy, allowing the node to function as a gateway for\r\n                // nodes hidden behind it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy interpretation of this is that the transaction should be relayed, even if it was rejected for not meeting the min mempool fee. I checked for when the check for mempool min happens, and it's after the check for `whitelistforcerelay`, which means the same transaction will also not be relayed, even if it was from a whitelisted node, which appears to contradict what was intended according to the comment.",
