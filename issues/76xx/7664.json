We should try to look at some data after the change for 0.12 and see if that is actually the case and regardless work at improving the coin selection algorithm to avoid that concern before the 0.13 release.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7657 and #4906 for back story.\r\n\r\n\r\nTag with 0.13 milestone please",
