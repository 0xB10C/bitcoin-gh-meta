   "body" : "\r\nApologies for a non-technical post made to this list with the purpose\r\nof congratulating the work done in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\n\r\nI expreienced some time delay in getting this message posted due to the concerted efforts of a certain BTCdak who felt this encouraging message would be better suited to the shit-talking spew-breath at #bitcoin-discuss where I won't post because of the effluent manifested there.\r\n\r\nSlap round your fucking head BTCdrak. You Andresen-legacy bossy man.\r\n\r\nMy message is:\r\n\r\nFor a change, a cool evening in the south of Thailand, with a new moon\r\nencouraging introspection over the calm Andaman Sea.\r\n\r\nSincere gratitude to the core developers and all Core contributors.\r\nDespite pervasive negative social mood towards this group and its\r\nproductive output, Bitcoin continues to improve in its security, the\r\nefficiency of its network and its prospects for the future as Layer 1\r\nof a thriving censorship-resistant asset-based economy.\r\n\r\nIsn't it surprising how productive this space has become since the\r\ndeparture of the disruptive Mike Hearn? R3 will discover that\r\nblockchain is great - but impractical - without vested interest and\r\nincentivised participation. Hopefully, habitual consensus breakers\r\nsuch as Gavin Andresen will also, eventually, ostracize themselves\r\nfrom this purpose-driven group. As always, continue proposing\r\ninnovative (even contentious) ideas, but campaign them at the peril of\r\nyour creditworthiness.\r\n\r\nPlease continue the endevour of making a defiant programmable money\r\nthat doesn't buckle to the demands of a failing credit-based economy\r\nor the opportunistic business interests that serve it. Detractors,\r\nsuch as Coinbase, are ultimately dependent for their survival on\r\nSilicon Valley Bank - a satellite of the Fed - the antithesis of what\r\nBitcoin represents.\r\n\r\nRegarding the invocation of ClassicCoin, my international base of\r\nclients and I are committed to continue transacting on, and mining,\r\nthe Bitcoin Core blockchain, indefinitely. We do so because of the\r\nfundamental value of the caliber of development happening in Core and\r\nthe innovation of Segregated Witness. As speculators, investors and\r\nminers we welcome the latter-day fee increases and the fundamental\r\nvalue embodied by network security and the Rule of Consensus.\r\n\r\nYou're doing great work here.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong Live Bitcoin! Long Live!\r\n\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\nVenzen Khaosan\r\n",
