      "body" : "@MarcoFalke I think this is going the wrong direction with making `CFeeRate` more convoluted.\r\nI think we could get rid of that $&$*! special case for 0, and be fine with the truncated version, or round normally, or ceiling all the time, but not make it optional.\r\n\r\nWe should also switch the internal representation to satoshis per MB or a double so that we could add a new member function to give greater precision, since mining doesn't use `CFeeRate` anyway and uses the actual fee per byte.\r\n",
