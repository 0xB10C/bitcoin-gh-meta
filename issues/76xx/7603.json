InstallDir wasn't replaced because the current text has an uppercase B, and I'm not sure of a good way to capitalize the result of PACKAGE_TARNAME.\r\n3. A comment in the Main Installer section wasn't replaced because comments don't ever face the end user.\r\n4. The registry value \"URL:Bitcoin\" wasn't replaced for the same reason as InstallDir.\r\n5. Startup shortcut wasn't replaced for the same reason as InstallDir.\r\n\r\nAll other appearances of \"bitcoin\" in the NSIS script were replaced.",
