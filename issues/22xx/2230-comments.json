I don't care what the naming scheme is, just pick one and make it so.\r\n\r\nAuto-generated README:  I say no, we can do that in a future release.\r\nftruncate() : I say no, disk space is cheap. Time would be better spent testing a more important feature (if we care about disk space, then pruning would be that more important feature; I don't care much about disk space, though).\r\n",
