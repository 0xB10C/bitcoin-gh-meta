   "body" : "This PR is based on #22787 (\"refactor: actual immutable pointing\"), which should be reviewed first.\r\n\r\nIt aims to make the CWallet shared pointers actually immutable also for the `dumpprivkey` and `dumpwallet` RPC methods. For doing that, some more preparations are needed; we need a const-counterpart to the helper `EnsureLegacyScriptPubKeyMan` that accepts a const CWallet pointer and accordingly also returns a const `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan` instance. The metadata lookup in `dumpwallet` is changed to not need a mutable `ScriptPubKeyMan` instance by avoiding using the `operator[]` in its mapKeyMetadata map, which also avoids repeated lookups.",
