This is the recommended approach.\n-- Download the source code, build each dependency, add the required include paths, link libraries and binary tools to the Visual Studio project files.\n-- Use [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/) packages with the understanding that any binary files have been compiled by an untrusted third party.\n+```\n \n-The [external dependencies](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md) required for building are listed in the `build_msvc/vcpkg.json` file. To ensure `msbuild` project files automatically install the `vcpkg` dependencies use:\n+By default, vcpkg makes both `release` and `debug` builds for each package.\n+To save build time and disk space, one could skip `debug` builds (example uses PowerShell):\n+```powershell\n \n-```\n-vcpkg integrate install\n+Add-Content -Path \"vcpkg\\triplets\\x64-windows-static.cmake\" -Value \"set(VCPKG_BUILD_TYPE release)\"\n ```\n \n Qt\n ---------------------\n-In order to build Bitcoin Core a static build of Qt is required.
