   "body" : "The RecursiveMutex `cs_nBlockSequenceId` is only used at one place in `CChainState::ReceivedBlockTransactions()` to atomically read-and-increment the nBlockSequenceId member:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/83daf47898f8a79cb20d20316c64becd564cf54c/src/validation.cpp#L2973-L2976\r\n\r\nFor this simple use-case, we can make the member `std::atomic` instead to achieve the same result (see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/operator_arith).\r\n\r\nThis is related to #19303. As suggested in the issue, I first planned to change the `RecursiveMutex` to `Mutex` (still possible if the change doesn't get Concept ACKs), but using a Mutex for this simple operation seems to be overkill. Note that at the time when this mutex was introduced (PR #3370, commit 75f51f2a63e0ebe34ab290c2b7141dd240b98c3b) `std::atomic` were not used in the codebase yet -- according to `git log -S std::atomic` they have first appeared in 2016 (commit 7e908c7b826cedbf29560ce7a668af809ee71524), probably also because the compilers didn't support them properly earlier.",
