      "body" : "I think #19762 is a better solution to the problem of supporting large numbers of optional arguments. #19762 allows options to be specified without having to quote JSON on the command line and provides a more natural calling interface for languages like python that support named arguments. Unlike this PR, it is fully generic and does not require adding and maintaining confusing backwards compatibility code inside individual RPC method implementations.\r\n\r\n#19762 can also be a foundation for supporting future usability improvements like being able to declare individual arguments keyword-only (only allowed to be passed by name and not position).",
