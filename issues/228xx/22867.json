   "body" : "Intention of this PR is to extend test coverage of BIP125. Mostly around [Rule 5](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki#implementation-details). Focus is on highlighting confusing/inconsistent behavior that I think we need to consider as we move forward with multiple PRs (and different approaches to BIP125 in general) that are under review.\r\n\r\nThis PR also splits tests out of #22698 (which I've made a draft for now until some related PRs are merged) as they are generally useful and highlight some behavior I think is worth considering.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I do not see any reason we can't eliminate all these inconsistencies while keeping inherited signaling, which is what #22698 does. But either way, making it clear in tests at least motivates a longer-term fix",
