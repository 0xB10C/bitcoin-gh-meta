I also think having a markdown doc would be appropriate for guiding the process, as code comments might not be clear/communicative enough to people not familiar with the code, and BIPs are too static. I would frame it as \"don't just broadcast any transaction and expect it to propagate, here are some restrictions enforced by Bitcoin Core policy (not necessarily exhaustive)\"\r\n\r\nwrt maintainability, not to discount the burden of maintaining docs, but policy doesn't really change that much... maybe we can give it a shot? :)",

Though we have 50y of history proving that's a not so bad engineering practice in the area of computer networking :)\r\n\r\nDocumentation is a formidable tool to formalize thinking and actually interrogate the well-foundedness and correctness of any code. It would also ease the understanding of new contributors and help them to review muzzy part of the codebase like the mempool. \r\n\r\n> My recommendation for users is to test all of their use cases on each upgrade of Bitcoin Core, including all edge cases they rely on, ideally with an automated test suite to minimize their repeated work. Thus they should already be aware of the policy rules they rely on, and also be notified of changes by their test suite.\r\n\r\nI agree with this.\r\n\r\nIt's unrealistic to expect Core developers to track and understand any new use case. Ultimately it's the responsibility of the application developers to think about the assumptions they're doing on Core policy and be fully-aware it might to change to their _detriment_. \r\n\r\nThat said, I think it would help application quality audit if policy changes happen in the beginning or mid release schedule. Further it's really _hard_ to ensure your test suite is reflecting Core behavior, straightforward toolchain might not exist yet (see https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoinconsensus/pull/15).\r\n\r\n> If there are plans to nonetheless document the relay policy, it raises questions what to include in what form and how to keep it up-to-date/consistent.\r\n\r\nYes let's avoid the BIP process it's too much static, maybe we can try a`doc/policy/*.md` ?\r\n\r\nHappy to try the experiment with my full-rbf proposal for 0.24 and write an updated documentation of our replacement logic. Then documenting  `PreChecks`'s list of checks could be following steps if we think it's good practice.\r\n\r\n(Maybe the new package acceptance checks could be documented there too?)\r\n\r\nLastly, yes it's a maintenance burden though if we don't I think we'll let proliferate more safety risks for our downstream users and find us in thorny situations where we have to arbitrarily favor use-case A over use-case B.

Firstly, we have to consider alternative implementations to Core e.g. @pinheadmz was the [first](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/88813/is-inherited-replace-by-fee-signaling-implemented-as-described-in-bip125) to discover the BIP 125 issue while reimplementing it for Bcoin. Reimplementing from scratch a spec/standard seems superior to just copying the code in Core.\r\n\r\nI think the better approach would be to document this in the Core repo under the expectation that significant step changes to tx relay policy should be BIPed. The Core docs can be a moving target while changes that deserve more scrutiny should be BIPed. I really don't like this attitude that because Core's consensus code is the ultimate authority on consensus that Core's policy code should also be the ultimate authority on policy. The former can't be avoided, the latter can be.\r\n\r\nedit: My understanding is that Layer 2 wants transaction relay policy to be as static as possible (or at least when changes are made they are well communicated in advance to Layer 2). To this end the extra scrutiny of a BIP for a significant change should be beneficial.",
