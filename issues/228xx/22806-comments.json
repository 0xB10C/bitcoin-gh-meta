      "body" : "This sounds like it could help clarify expectations around mempool policy and tx relay for users and application devs. I've heard people express confusion and fear about it, though I haven't heard anyone request a doc specifically.\r\n\r\nI agree that devs should be writing tests for the assumptions they're making. I also think having a markdown doc would be appropriate for guiding the process, as code comments might not be clear/communicative enough to people not familiar with the code, and BIPs are too static. I would frame it as \"don't just broadcast any transaction and expect it to propagate, here are some restrictions enforced by Bitcoin Core policy (not necessarily exhaustive)\"\r\n\r\nwrt maintainability, not to discount the burden of maintaining docs, but policy doesn't really change that much... maybe we can give it a shot? :)",
