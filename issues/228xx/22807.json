   "body" : "Taken from #19443. There two additional arguments `paginatebypointer` and `nextpagepointer` were added and @luke-jr proposed that they could be united with existing `skip` argument into single `options` JSON argument. This is better approach than continue adding more and more different arguments for different output options. #22775 proposes to add sorting order as additional argument, I think it's better to use the same approach there too. Having this as a separate PR will make reviews and testing simpler.\r\n\r\nTests for old and new way of providing `skip` argument should be added, but didn't do it here as functional tests currently don't have tests for `skip` at all. I plan to add them later in a separate PR.",
