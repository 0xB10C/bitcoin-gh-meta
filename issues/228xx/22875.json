We can either move the static to it's own area and require init be called explicitly, or just allow concurrent first callers to race to fill in an atomic variable that never changes thereafter. The second approach is taken here.\r\n\r\nStatic initialization *is* threadsafe, but only insofar as definining the variable being guaranteed to be called once. This is used incorrectly here.\r\n\r\n@practicalswift --> are there tools we can deploy to catch usage like this?",
