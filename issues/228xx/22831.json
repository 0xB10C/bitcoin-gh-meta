   "body" : "PR #22697 introduced a severe reproducible bug in commit 181a1207 that appears to cause the addrman tried table to become corrupt and significantly lose peer entries when the `-asmap` configuration option is used. \r\n\r\nThe corruption occurs on bitcoind restart due to an initialization order change in `src/init.cpp` in that commit whereby CAddrman asmap is set after deserializing `peers.dat`, rather than before.\r\n\r\nI reviewed that change and failed to see the bug until a few days after the merge.\r\n\r\nIssue reported on the `#bitcoin-core-dev` IRC channel starting at https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2021-08-23.html#l-263.\r\n\r\n```\r\naddrman lost 22813 new and 2 tried addresses due to collisions or invalid addresses\r\nADDRMAN CONSISTENCY CHECK FAILED!!! err=-17 bitcoind: ./addrman.h:707: void CAddrMan::Check() const: Assertion `false' failed. Aborted\r\n```\r\n \r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- launch bitcoind with the `-asmap` and `-checkaddrman=1` configuration options enabled\r\n- restart bitcoind\r\n- bitcoind aborts on the second call to the addrman consistency checks in `CAddrMan::Check()`\r\n\r\nThis pull adds regression tests and patches the issue.\r\n",
