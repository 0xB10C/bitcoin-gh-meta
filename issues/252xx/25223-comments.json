I don't see any modifications in the kernel folder or the kernel build target.s\r\n\r\nAh yes, as the companion PR to #25215, this PR also \"reduces the number of call sites where we explicitly construct CTxMemPool. This is done in preparation for later PRs which decouple the mempool module from ArgsManager...\"\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges I found with making the upcoming `CTxMemPool+MemPoolAccept+mempool-relevant parts of CChainState` <-> `ArgsManager` decoupling PRs easy to review was that from the view point of a reviewer, it was hard to reason that the behavior at each `CTxMemPool` construction call site was preserved. This is because after we decouple from `ArgsMan`, instead of reaching for `gArgs` deep in the mempool code, we now have to make sure that the options are set correctly and passed to each `CTxMemPool` that we construct. During development I also ran into some inadvertent bugs stemming from this.\r\n\r\nAs an example: When we stop asking `gArgs` for `-mempoolexpiry` or `-maxmempool` in `CTxMemPool+MemPoolAccept+mempool-relevant parts of CChainState`, and instead construct `CTxMemPool` with an `CTxMemPool::Options` with these parameters as struct members, preserving existing behaviour means that **_every_** `CTxMemPool` construction call site would have to get the default `CTxMemPool::Options` and apply `gArgs` overrides.\r\n\r\nI reasoned that since these `CTxMemPool` constructor calls were entirely unnecessary in the first place, and the fix wasn't that involved, we could kill two birds with one stone: remove what's unnecessary and also make the `ArgsMan` decoupling PRs easier to reason about.",

Mostly I just don't think moving things around and changing namespaces for everything needs to be done right now. Looking at past reviews it also seems that people expect things in `src/kernel/` to have some kind of cleanliness, even though we're not going to be refining the API until Phase 2, so I'd like to avoid the sum of these little expectations to make it harder for the main thrust of Phase 1 to get through review.",

      "body" : "libbitcoinkernel doesn't have anything to do with mining. However, mining does require (prior to this PR) a mempool. In many cases, these mempool are sometimes constructed on-the-fly (not as part of init). For example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/640eb772e55671c5dab29843cebe42ec35cb703f/src/rpc/mining.cpp#L357-L358\r\n\r\nTherefore, when I start making `CTxMemPool` options explicitly passed in to `CTxMemPool`'s constructor instead of just being globals inside `gArgs`, the on-the-fly calls to `CTxMemPool`'s constructor become much more involved.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n        CTxMemPool::Options mempool_opts{};\r\n        OverlayArgsManSettings(mempool_opts);\r\n        CTxMemPool empty_mempool{mempool_opts};\r\n        std::unique_ptr<CBlockTemplate> blocktemplate(BlockAssembler{chainman.ActiveChainstate(), empty_mempool}.CreateNewBlock(coinbase_script));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, it would be another story if any of these `empty_mempool`s were being useful, but it seems that they're basically unused, so there's no need for this charade. We can just remove `BlockAssembler`'s dependence on `CTxMemPool` by making it nullable and call it a day.",

I did not push this approach because it requires quite a lot of call sites to be changed.\r\n\r\nI don't think that would be better; I think the [reference to] mempool belongs as a member of the class. Since the class also keeps track of things like `nBlockWeight` and `nFees` of the block, that suggests to me the intention is 1 `BlockAssembler` instance = building 1 block template. So I can't think of why it would be safe/useful to change which mempool we're using, and thus the mempool should remain a member and in fact\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\n    const CTxMemPool* const m_mempool;\r\n```\r\n?",
