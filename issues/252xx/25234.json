   "body" : "#### Rationale\r\n\r\n`AvailableCoins` is part of several important flows for the wallet; from RPC commands that create transactions like `fundrawtransaction`, `send`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, get the available balance, list the available coins with `listunspent` etc. to GUI connected processes that perform the same or similar actions: tx creation, available balance calculation, present the spendable coins in the coin control dialog.\r\n\r\nAs we are improving this process in #24699, #25005 and there are more structural changes coming on the way. This benchmark aims to ensure us that, at least, there are no regressions (obviously performance improvements are great but, at least for me, this heads into the direction of having a base metric to compare future structural changes).\r\n\r\n#### Implementation Notes\r\n\r\nThere are 5 new benchmarks, one per wallet supported output type (LEGACY, P2SH_SEGWIT, BECH32, BECH32M), plus a multi-output-type wallet benchmark which contains outputs from all the descriptor types.\r\n\r\nThe test, by default, fills-up the wallet with 1k transactions, 2k outputs. Mainly to not consume much time if the user just want to verify that no substantial regressions were introduced. But, my expectation for those who are focused on this process is to use a much higher number locally to really note the differences across commits.",
