      "body" : "> Can you explain _why_ this fixes the bug? This may change the memory usage, but I fail to see a memory leak or how this fixes it.\r\n\r\nI was testing based on the things shared in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25229 and trying to improve performance. I am assuming the issue is accidentally fixed with this pull request but need confirmation from reviewers. I did not find memory leak but bitcoind crashes when using `listtransactions` multiple times.\r\n\r\nFirst thing that I wanted to change in the code was `std::list` with something that has less performance issues in C++. After reading a few articles found that `std::vector` can be an easy replacement to improve performance in this case.\r\n\r\n> In C++ there is only one God, and its name is vector.\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.quasar.ai/using-c-containers-efficiently\r\n\r\n> std::vector is insanely faster than std::list to find an element\r\nstd::vector always performs faster than std::list with very small data\r\nstd::vector is always faster to push elements at the back than std::list\r\nstd::list handles large elements very well, especially for sorting or inserting in the front\r\n\r\nhttps://dzone.com/articles/c-benchmark-%E2%80%93-stdvector-vs\r\n\r\nCleared vector elements in `ListTransactions()` because I think its not going out of scope to free memory and is required before running `listtransactions` again. It was also done in `CachedTxGetAmounts()` in [src/wallet/receive.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ba48fcf4a40c5b9888459511fb4233a1b89184cc/src/wallet/receive.cpp#L230)",
