      "body" : "Hi @gavinandresen, I've emailed you about this, but I might as well mention it here. There a lot of people who would like to see bitcoin with its 1MB block limit continue to exist. I am in favour of a hard fork to allow bitcoin to scale, but only if it doesn't destroy the 1MB-limit bitcoin in the process. I would like to see how both evolve rather than having to choose between them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, since you are already proposing a hard fork, why not make the hard fork merge mine with the existing bitcoin - this way miners can continue to mine both coins. Our coins in each coin will be safe, and whatever happens to the market cap - i.e. whichever prospers, everyone will have hedged their bets since their coins will exist in both forks (at the point of the fork). I think it is far more likely that the market cap combined for the two coins will suffer far less than the market cap of just one coin continuing - since not everyone will have confidence in the coin chosen, whereas far more people are likely to have confidence in one OR the other.\r\n\r\nPublicity around this could suggest who goes with which coin. Exchanges of course would want to continue allowing trading for both, but most merchants I'd expect would want to default to the scalable bitcoin. The current/original 1MB bitcoin will in time become associated to be more gold-like (for long-term investments), whereas the scaled bitcoin will in time become more associated with money and day-to-day transactions.\r\n\r\nI have yet to hear any logical arguments against this proposal - other than \"publicity nightmare\", which I think can equally (or more) apply to a solution which disallows either the 1MB coin to live or disallows the scaled coin to be born.",

      "body" : "Note to readers: in its current form there is a near zero chance of this getting merged due to a number of BIP-level issues in addition to debate about the patch itself. For instance, Gavin has never given any details about testing; at minimum we'd need a BIP16 style quality assurance document. We also frown on writing software with building expiration dates, let alone expiration dates that trigger non-deterministically. (Note how my recently merged CLTV considered the year 2038 problem to avoid needing a hard fork at that date)\r\n\r\nUntil these issues are addressed I an many other contributors will be muting this thread and ignoring comments until the BIP itself is fixed. Much of the discussion we see in conversations around this subject is highly repetitive and a big timesink; don't interpret silence as agreement.",
