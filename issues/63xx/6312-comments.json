Notably, see how without a way to fix tx mutability the nSequence proposal really isn't any different in practice than just signing increasingly decreasing nLockTime's? Because if you could safely sign the transaction it'd already be mined and thus you don't need a relative nSequence - an absolute nLockTime calculated from the height/time of the tx you know already is in the chain is fine.\r\n\r\nIMO there's no reason to merge this until it has a safe use-case that provides a concrete benefit over the existing status quo; a simple change in what exact number is being signed isn't a concrete benefit.",
