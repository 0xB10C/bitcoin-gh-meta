      "body" : "So, @mruddy brought up two issues that are really the same as with the BIP66 tests: out of date copyright headers and TODO items that are out of date. The latter issue is pretty simple: bipdersig-p2p.py covers the missing test cases marked as \"TODO\" in bipdersig.py\r\n\r\nI wanted to show I've replicated the exact same testing procedure done on BIP66 given that the code changes itself are also replicated exactly; if I'm going to fix these two nits I think it makes sense to fix them in the BIP66 tests first, in a separate commit that'll go first in this pull-req, so the two sets of tests can still be diffed directly to show exact equivalence. Makes sense?\r\n\r\n@mruddy Yup, I'll add release notes later, and similarly, will look at what changing the NOP2 name will entail later. Right now I'm focused on making the minimal possible change that gets the job done so backporting the changes to v0.10.x (and probably v0.11.x) will be easy and clearly correct. v0.12.x can do the more invasive stuff of changing opcode names and what-not.",

      "body" : "@petertodd I see what you're saying about trying to keep the diff compares as close and easy as possible. But, the diffs on the tests are necessarily going to be somewhat different. I wouldn't make updated BIP66 test cases part of this change set. My choice would be to make the minor cleanups to these tests so that they are cleaner when reviewed in isolation (and in the future, not within the context of how this change set compares to that of BIP66). I can see how line-only diffs vs some block or structural diffs might have some value to reduce dissonance though. So, however you want to handle it is OK with me.\r\n\r\nAbout the decode name update, I agree, leave that until later. I was just saying that if you mention the upcoming change in the notes now, then it makes actually pushing it through later, easier. It's more of a busy work change anyways, so leave it for someone newer to the project than yourself to work on. It's good for someone newer to work on because of how it may affect various parts of the code base.",
