In the future that may change, but for now we're stuck with defining at least some broad notion of what miner policy might be.\r\n\r\nAnyway, not adopting full-RBF is also a policy decision.",

That would require something like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5180 first.\r\nThat would clarify the notion that the standard policy is not part of the consensus rules (as well as providing more flexibility without having to necessarily expose a zillion \"standard policy runtime options\" like we're doing now).\r\nThat doesn't mean that full-RBF can't become part of the standard policy at some point. I would be in favor of that. I would also be in favor to make FSS-RBF part of the standard policy as soon as possible.\r\nSupporting multiple policies would also remove the need for independently maintaining advanced policies patches (like you're currently doing) even if it's decided not to make it the standard policy until a later date. At that point, you may still want to offer first seen and FSS-RBF as alternative policies that people who don't like full-RBF can run.\r\n",
