Unless I'm misunderstanding, the `.dmg` that the (non-gitian) build process for OS X outputs doesn't contain that in the name, and that's a good thing. The `{un,}signed` only makes sense in the context of the gitian process, so gitian should include it in output file names, but the normal build process (e.g. if you're building yourself) shouldn't.",
