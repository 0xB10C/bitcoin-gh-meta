The vulnerability is reduced to a known level per attacker node by this bug fix.\r\n\r\nAttacker blinds both funds receiver and a small miner to a 1-conf double spend, and the block containing it (attacker must be the first to inv the block to these nodes).  If the small miner produces a block, funds receiver believes he has 1 confirmation.\r\n",
