      "body" : "Hmm.... this means, that `fundrawtransaction` or our coin selection doesn't work properly.\r\n\r\n`fundrawtransaction.py`:\r\n1. At L35 we send a 1.5BTC coin to `node[2]`\r\n2. At L39 we mine the tx from 1. and sync the nodes\r\n3. At L50 we fund(rawtransaction) a new tx on `node[2]` with one output of 1.0 BTC.\r\n4. Because we have sent a 1.5BTC to `node[2]` (mined and synced), it should prefer this 1.5BTC coin instead of taking a 50BTC coin.\r\n\r\nThe assertion fails because the test showed that the 50BTC coin has been preferred.\r\n\r\nI can't reproduce this on my systems.\r\nHas anyone found out a way to reproduce that?",
