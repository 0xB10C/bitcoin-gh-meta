      "body" : "@schildbach I'll work on that.\r\n\r\n@petertodd Don't confuse the strict DER (\"canonical encoding\") requirement with the low-S rule (which is just there to break malleability). The latter (the S value in the signature needs to be less than half of the curve's order; the exact semantics are in BIP62) is Bitcoin specific, and not something you can ask OpenSSL to do, unfortunately. It's not hard to fix manually though. There is no even/odd rule anymore - that used to be in the code for a short time, but low-s instead of even-s is not harder and results in on average half a byte smaller sigs.",
