Official builds must be created using an entirely free/open stack, including the toolchain. mingw is much easier to automate for c-i and deployments, so it's the obvious choice for us.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's no reason why the code shouldn't build under MSVC.

But it will be a maintenance burden to make sure that doesn't get out of sync when files are moved around. Maybe it would be possible to generate a MSVC solution file from the current build system somehow.\r\n\r\nI also know it's possible to call the MSVC compiler from WINE, so scripting to run it automatically on a linux host would be possible, which can make it a little easier for the other developers without windows to check it as well.\r\n\r\nSeems like quite some work, but if you think it's worth the trouble, why not.\r\n",

I think core should be available on windows as well as any other OS with native support and willing to help.

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5.
