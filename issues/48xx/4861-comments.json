This is with the exact same bitcoin sources (commit 93193c8) with which I was able to reproduce the bug every time yesterday.\r\n\r\nSo I strongly suspect this was just a bug in the Debian-packaged version of libminiupnpc-dev in the 'testing' distro.  Closing this ticket for now; if it reoccurs, I'll re-open.",
