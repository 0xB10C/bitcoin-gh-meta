It will still keep a perfect, verifiable record of history, as it is supposed to.\r\n\r\nAt the maximum growth (assuming full 1MB blocks, something we don't have yet) of ~50GB/year it will grow to a terabyte in ~20 years. With the growth of commercially-offered data storage I'm sure we'll laugh about that amount by then.\r\n\r\nFull nodes that want to bootstrap from scratch will have to fetch a lot of data - which can take some time, depending on the bandwidth available by then - but that isn't a critical problem. If bitcoin gains any popularity it will be easy to get hold of the data anyhow.\r\n",
