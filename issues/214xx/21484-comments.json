This will save me time, because I don't have to aggregate the snippet (or anyone else doing the aggregation). IIRC the only reasons we started using snippets is:\r\n\r\n* Makes backport easier, because snippets only end up in the backports and can easily be removed from master.\r\n* Makes merge-conflicts less common for long-standing pull requests, because snippets don't conflict with each other.\r\n\r\nNone of the reasons apply here, because 18335 isn't tagged for backport and this pull request is not long-lived.",
