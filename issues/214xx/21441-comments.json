There, devs can have a summary of what's the project's current status. Having a build badge in the README is a best-practice widely adopted here in Github.\r\n\r\nThe per-commit status you mentioned is useful for a core developer interested in checking whether their latest push is successful, which is also very important, but not the same as the badge in the README. In essence, no non-core developer will navigate to the latest commit or to the Cirrus website (which I just had to do, hence this PR) to check if the project is correctly building.",
