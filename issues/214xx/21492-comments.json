      "body" : "> For what it's worth in web browsers there's currently a trend toward simplifying user agents, creating less variants instead of more. Mostly for privacy reasons. Is signalling this extra information in the user agent useful for the user of the node, or is it simply for statistics for the developers?\r\n\r\nMakes sense. But this is optional. Privacy is about things that a user does not want to share with others. Also you could write anything in that comment.\r\n\r\n> Sometimes remote attacks can only be exploited in a specific environment, putting that specific environment into the ua and sending it to the attacker seems counter productive.\r\n\r\nCan also be helpful if fake environment details are shared. Example: TTL in ping can be used to identify OS https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/win-usa-01/Arkin/Briefings/win-01-arkin.ppt\r\nhttps://superuser.com/a/620521/\r\n\r\nHowever lot of servers spoof it so that normal attacks can be avoided as they will try for different OS.\r\n\r\nAdded `uacomment=Windows 95` in `bitcoin.conf` on Ubuntu\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/111909345-ece8e680-8a82-11eb-9b9c-c827ed9827a8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n> You could argue for removing the UA entirely. But so long as it's there, there's no reason to stop other people from using it as intended. (Nobody is forcing anyone to use this if they don't want to.)\r\n\r\nAgree\r\n\r\nAlso there is no option in ABCore app to use remote full node, the app has its own `bitcoind` so can we use `-uacomment` ?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/111908900-fc673000-8a80-11eb-93e2-22298c28bcf2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
