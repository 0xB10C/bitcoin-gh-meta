   "body" : "In #21415 [we decided](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21415#issuecomment-800236640) to return `std::optional` rather than `{}` for\r\nuninitialized values. This PR replaces the two remaining usages of `{}`\r\nwith `std::nullopt`.\r\n\r\nAs a side-effect, this also quells the spurious GCC 10.2.x warning that\r\nwe've had reported quite a few times. i.e #21318, #21248, #20797.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntxmempool.cpp: In member function âCTxMemPool::setEntries CTxMemPool::GetIterSet(const std::set<uint256>&) constâ:\r\ntxmempool.cpp:898:13: warning: â<anonymous>â may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]\r\n  898 |     return {};\r\n      |             ^\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",
