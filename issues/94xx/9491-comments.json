      "body" : "@gmaxwell I also found this surprising.  My first inclination was that we should change it, but then it means if you ever leave off a timestamp, you're stuck rescanning the whole chain.\r\n\r\nPerhaps with proper documentation we could have 3 states.\r\nrescan: false - no rescan\r\nno rescan option set - rescan starts at the minimum of only the provided timestamps (current behavior)\r\nrescan: true - rescan starts at genesis unless all timestamps are provided and then starts at the minimum of the timestamps.\r\n\r\n\r\nI only wish it could tell you what it was planning to rescan before it did it, so you could pull the plug on your computer if you got it wrong.",
