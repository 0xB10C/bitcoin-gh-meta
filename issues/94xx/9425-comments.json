The wallet contains the hashes of the top 10 blocks in the chain at flush time, plus exponentially further back ones (so: 1, 2, ..., 10, 11, 13, 17, 25, 41, 73, 137, 265, ... back). At startup, we find the latest common block between the new tip and those saved hashes, and automatically rescan from there. I don't know what pruning you're talking about - wallet transactions are never pruned.",
