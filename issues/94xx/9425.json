(in case of reorgs).\r\n\r\nIf upon reopening a wallet, the client cannot replay (and remove in the case of a re-org) the appropriate transactions since the latest hash.  All keys in the wallet should be set to include the unscanned range since the highest matching block hash and the current block height.\r\n\r\nThe ranges should be conservative so that the wallet can be quite confident that it knows about all the transactions that are not inside the unscanned ranges.  The wallet may also know about transactions that are inside the unscanned ranges.",
