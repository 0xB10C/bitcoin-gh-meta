      "body" : "There's so much currently wrong with this loop that I'm hesitant to make changes before rewriting it entirely. I've been discussing my plans with @TheBlueMatt for doing just that after #9289 is merged.\r\n\r\nSome other fun issues with this loop (I'm sure I'm leaving several out):\r\n- messageHandlerCondition wakes spuriously\r\n- The depth of vRecvGetData and messages to send aren't taken into consideration\r\n- cs_vRecvMsg is held for the duration of message processing, leading to insane lock contention\r\n\r\nI have no objections to slapping some band-aids on here, but I'm really really hoping to address all of those at once in my next PR which moves this handler into net_processing. As a bonus, it should simplify @TheBlueMatt's multi-threaded processing.",
