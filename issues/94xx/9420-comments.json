Apparently -fprofile-arcs is also doing the same thing right now for linking, but I wouldn't depend on it to be as robust or to pick up future coverage knobs.\r\n\r\nI wasn't previously aware we had this option, whenever I previously wanted to generate coverage I'd twiddled the cflags and ldflags myself.",

It's amazing what a code deep dive will turn up. :) I'm tempted to write a doc with all the config options and PR it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you're right. I somehow missed the lcov web page, which [says to use `--coverage` for both the compiler and linker](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php). Just compiled and linked on OSX (`make check` passes too), and did a fixup.",
