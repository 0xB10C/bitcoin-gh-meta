Apparently -fprofile-arcs is also doing the same thing right now for linking, but I wouldn't depend on it to be as robust or to pick up future coverage knobs.\r\n\r\nI wasn't previously aware we had this option, whenever I previously wanted to generate coverage I'd twiddled the cflags and ldflags myself.",
