However, there are two side effects I can think of:\r\n\r\n1) It would then have to tolerate bad spelling/punctuation/capitalization.\r\n2) It would require some more sophisticated logic in the `update` part of the script to make sure that the last holder is the one that is incremented and not necessarily the one with `The Bitcoin Core developers`.\r\n\r\nIt would be simple to enforce that the end year gets bumped upon file modification. There are a couple downsides, so I left it out (for now):\r\n1) It takes a minute or two to pull the file modification history info from git. In CI that probably isn't much of a problem though. In other codebases, I have seen similar checks as part of `make test` scripting so a check that is reasonably fast is desirable.\r\n2) It might take a period of adjustment to train everyone to update the year in sync with changes and this might create demand for \"increment every file on January 1st dammit!\".",

      "body" : "Thanks @laanwj - getting your take is most important. Keeping header adjustments periodic and asynchronous is perfectly reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe script improvements here are still useful for assessing and fixing up the headers as they drift over time. I have re-submitted as #9459 with the CI part and 'enforcement' language taken out.\r\n\r\n> Copyright is a grey area but please don't go on to add code style checks and such...\r\n\r\nCould you clarify your perspective on automated code style checks? Some sense of what is and isn't on the wish list would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, there are a couple levels of similar things that can be done for improving code style:\r\n\r\n1) a script to assess and highlight problems with basic style (spaces over tabstops, no trailing whitespace, don't end lines with double semicolons, etc...)\r\n2) attaching this basic style script to CI for enforcement\r\n3) a script wrapper to run clang-format/pylint/whatever and highlight deviations from a preferred style\r\n4) attaching this script wrapper CI to lock down a preferred style in the codebase (probably starting out with an include/exclude list to manage pain, but then ratchet up)\r\n\r\n1 and 3 can be done in a similar way to copyright_header.py to assess and periodically nudge the code in a good direction asynchronous to day-to-day development PRs.\r\n\r\n2 and 4 are more for automating away style nits to better focus on PR contents. Also, ratcheting towards and achieving a consistent code style helps make reading the code easier and bugs shallower. I would expect this to be more controversial since it requires some irritation and short-term pain. However if 1 and 3 are well-built and mature first, demand for CI integration may naturally follow.",
