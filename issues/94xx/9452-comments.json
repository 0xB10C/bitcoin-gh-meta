However, there are two side effects I can think of:\r\n\r\n1) It would then have to tolerate bad spelling/punctuation/capitalization.\r\n2) It would require some more sophisticated logic in the `update` part of the script to make sure that the last holder is the one that is incremented and not necessarily the one with `The Bitcoin Core developers`.\r\n\r\nIt would be simple to enforce that the end year gets bumped upon file modification. There are a couple downsides, so I left it out (for now):\r\n1) It takes a minute or two to pull the file modification history info from git. In CI that probably isn't much of a problem though. In other codebases, I have seen similar checks as part of `make test` scripting so a check that is reasonably fast is desirable.\r\n2) It might take a period of adjustment to train everyone to update the year in sync with changes and this might create demand for \"increment every file on January 1st dammit!\".",
