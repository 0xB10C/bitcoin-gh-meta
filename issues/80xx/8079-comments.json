This requires a lot more engineering effort, and in some cases commitment techniques are insufficient as you really do need proof-of-publication of arbitrary data.",

I intend to fix this when I find time, and at the same time re-propose making bare multisig relaying disabled by default (but not as a side effect of this policy).
