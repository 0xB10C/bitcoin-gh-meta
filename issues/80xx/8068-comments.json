I'll investigate...\r\n\r\nThe question is, if the travis failure in `test_bitcoin` is the same I see here...\r\n\r\nLooks like the same problem was already reported by me: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7696#issuecomment-197200010\r\n\r\nSeparate issue now: #8069\r\n",

This requires expensive copying that could be avoided with shared_ptr (alternatively, see #8099)\r\n* During transaction relay, BIP35 processing, and tx getdata, we fetch mempool transactions (copying them!) before determining whether they can be relayed. Especially with filters active, this is a pretty expensive operation for omitted cases. As none of the things done with the result (filtering, inving, serializing) require a full copy, shared_ptr would be far more efficient.\n* mapRelay often contains transactions that are also stored in the mempool. Shared_ptr's would alleviate duplicate storage space.\r\n* In this PR, it would avoid the need for manual reference counting and for giving the CTxMempool the weird responsibility for owning transactions that aren't even in the mempool anymore.\r\n",
