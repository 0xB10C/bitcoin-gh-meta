For pruning there may be an additional constraints (and/or a few old blocks may have to be re-downloaded, to ensure that the last 550MB of blocks is there), but I don't see why it couldn't work in principle, and it'd still be possible to restore much faster than starting entirely from scratch.\r\n\r\nEdit: Hm thinking about this that may not even be necessary. If the database backup is not too old, from before the last pruned block, it would just revisit the blocks on disk and end up where it left.",
