This same back and forth has been going on for years, with the same people giving the same replies, and as a result the keypool logic is still the same as in 2012. At least what @pstratem proposes (increasing the default key pool size) is a small improvement.\r\n\r\nSo is there any drawback in moving Bitcoin Core's wallet from a keypool system to hardened BIP32? If this is just a few-line change, why hasn't this done yet? \r\nOne reason could be that a few line change doesn't mean it's easy to review - do people trust it? maybe it's hard to assure that it is correct. I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nIt would reduce the need for secure randomness enormously (reduced the throughput necessary in e.g. #7891), to just generating of seeds.\r\n",
