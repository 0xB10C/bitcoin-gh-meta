I think, it even should be avoided because it is known that some contributors prefer not to sign or don't even have a key.\r\n\r\nIt should be sufficient to verify that the current HEAD of master is signed and also is a 'clean' merge (no conflicts solved, no additional diff). Afterward, verify recursively that each parent of that commit is either a valid (signed, clean merge) commit OR trusted_root OR a (likely unsigned) commit, which is known to be reviewed.",
