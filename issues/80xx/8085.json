   "body" : "This work creates CConnman. The idea is to begin moving data structures and functionality out of globals in net.h and into an instanced class, in order to avoid side-effects in networking code. Eventually, an (internal) api begins to emerge, and as long as the conditions of that api are met, the inner-workings may be a black box.\r\n\r\nFor now (for ease), a single global CConnman is created. Down the road, the instance could be passed around instead. Also, CConnman should be moved out of net.h/net.cpp, but that can be done in a separate move-only-ish step.\r\n\r\nA few todos remain, some of which can be done in a follow-up:\r\n- Actually create connman.h/cpp and move the class there.\r\n- there are ```if(g_connman)```'s everywhere. A few places should assume that a connman is running (or it should be passed around). For example, ProcessMessages.\r\n- RPC needs a new error for dealing with the \"p2p not enabled\" case.\r\n- GetRelayTx/RelayTransaction are awkward. Where should mapRelay live? Should it be dealt with directly rather than hidden inside of relay functions?\r\n- Deal with fDiscover/fListen in CConnman\r\n- How to deal with CConnman parameters? Continue adding them to Start(), or have it parse the program options itself?\r\n",
