   "body" : "This work creates CConnman. The idea is to begin moving data structures and functionality out of globals in net.h and into an instanced class, in order to avoid side-effects in networking code. Eventually, an (internal) api begins to emerge, and as long as the conditions of that api are met, the inner-workings may be a black box.\r\n\r\nFor now (for ease), a single global CConnman is created. Down the road, the instance could be passed around instead. Also, CConnman should be moved out of net.h/net.cpp, but that can be done in a separate move-only-ish step.\r\n\r\nA few todos remain here:\r\n- ~~there are ```if(g_connman)```'s everywhere. A few places should assume that a connman is running (or it should be passed around). For example, ProcessMessages.~~\r\n- ~~GetRelayTx/RelayTransaction are awkward. Where should mapRelay live? Should it be dealt with directly rather than hidden inside of relay functions? (rebased on top of #8082)~~\r\n- ~~How to deal with CConnman parameters? Continue adding them to Start(), or have it parse the program options itself? (Created CConnman::Options)~~\r\n- ~~RPC needs a new error for dealing with the \"p2p not enabled\" case.~~\r\n\r\n\r\nTodos for a follow-up PR:\r\n- Actually create connman.h/cpp and move the class there.\r\n- Pass CConnman into QT similar to the wallet\r\n- ~~Drop StartNode/StopNode and just use CConnman::Stop/Start directly (Need to make sure that MapPort can be moved directly into Init without side-effects)~~\r\n- Pass CChainParams into CConnman and pass it around\r\n- ~~Create CConnmanOptions to reduce the verbosity of CConnman::Start()~~\r\n- Deal with fDiscover/fListen/etc in CConnman",
