The help text still reads correct to me (it still limits you to only that one connection), the only thing it changes is that previously we would disconnect-on-VERSION-message for -connect peers which do not set NODE_NETWORK, now we will keep it connected just the same as -addnode peers. If you think thats a critical change to document I'm happy to do so, but I think thats a rather esoteric case for -connect.",
