   "body" : "This updates the Windows build documentation with the workaround required to build using Ubuntu 17.04 on WSL, and makes it's explicit that building on Ubuntu 16.04 is broken, and not recommended.\r\n\r\nThis includes a commit from @donaloconnor in #11244, and is mostly the investigative work of @laanwj throughout #8732, #8653 and quite a few other issues.\r\n\r\nI tested building on 14.04, 16.04.3 and 17.04 [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11244#issuecomment-327990251) and got the results we expect. If someone else could also verify that builds are working on both 14.04 and 17.04 with these instructions, that would be great.",
