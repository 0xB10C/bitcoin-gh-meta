So:\r\n - `listwallets` - returns a lists of active/loaded wallets\r\n - `findwallets` - returns a list of all possible/available wallets.\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage that each RPC has it's own purpose and implementation, which happen to be very different. For those that manage (keep record of) the wallets externally `findwallets` is of no interest, only `listwallets`.",
