Its really unclear to me what the ZMQ API is, even - its not defined anywhere if clients should or should not rely on the ordering here. The fact that it was possible for our test to implies to me that we should maybe keep the ordering consistent, but I'm open to someone doing the work to document an stable API with or without a consistent ordering.",
