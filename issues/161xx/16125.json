   "body" : "We've solved the App Nap problem in #12783 which caused Bitcoin QT to dramatically slow down syncing if it's in the background. This affect all (modern) macOS users.\r\n\r\nThere's another problem however, which is that by default MacBooks suspend when the display is off, even when plugged into a power socket. This causes IBD to pause, which is annoying if you're trying to sync at night.\r\n\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-qa/HT202824\r\n\r\n<img width=\"664\" alt=\"Schermafbeelding 2019-05-30 om 13 00 49\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/58628856-14cdef80-82db-11e9-9896-44d251183f87.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggest solution: add a (macOS-only?) notice to the synchronization modal suggesting that laptop users turn on \"Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off\". It's not necessary to change the hard disk suspension default.\r\n\r\nI don't know if Apple exposes an API to detect this setting. I'm generally not in favor of OS specific modifications, but initial block download is a painful enough issue that small hints like this really help.",
