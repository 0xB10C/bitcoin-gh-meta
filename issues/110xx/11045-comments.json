I've played around with different ways to extend the fuzzing coverage myself, so I'd be really interested in checking your stuff out and how you've attacked the problem.\r\n\r\nIf you are not yet ready to submit a proper pull request I'd be glad to take a look at it as-is. Just dump the code in its current state in a gist, repo or somewhere convenient for you and I'll figure out the rest :-)\r\n\r\nFor reference, see some previous discussions about improving Bitcoin fuzzing :\r\n* [tests] Add fuzz testing for BlockTransactions, BlockTransactionsRequest and CBlockHeaderAndShortTxIDs deserialization, #10409\r\n* [tests] Add libFuzzer support, #10440\r\n* [tests] Speed up fuzzing by ~200x when using afl-fuzz, #10415\r\n* Feature request: Make Bitcoin libFuzzer-friendly and consider integration into the OSS-Fuzz project, #10364",
