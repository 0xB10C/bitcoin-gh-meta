It's just the directory /fuzzers with a number of cpp files and a Makefile, which references hardcoded relative paths (```../src/libbitcoin_util.a ../src/crypto/libbitcoin_crypto.a``` etc). If this is not what you want you must integrate it into the build scripts yourself because that is not my forte.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna prepare it now and make the PR.",
