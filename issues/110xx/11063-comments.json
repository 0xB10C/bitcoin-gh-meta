      "body" : "- Does this happen every time you start, or irregularly?\r\n- Can you paste the last part of the debug.log, before the crash?\r\n- openbsd's default gdb version is useless (it's from 2004, DWARF 3, the format that modern compilers use for debug information didn't exist yet at the time, and we even have DWARF 4 now). Can you try installing a newer gdb from ports, and get a traceback with that?\r\n- If you run the tests `make check` and `test/functional/test_runner.py` for the unit tests and functional tests respectively, do they pass?\r\n\r\nFYI I tried running bitcoind on OpenBSD 6.1 and did basic sanity tests and did not have this issue, so we need to figure out what triggers it in your case.",
