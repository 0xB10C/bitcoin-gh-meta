RPC method is\r\ndisabled by default in version x, but can be enabled by using the\r\n-enablerpcmethod argument. RPC method is removed entirely in version\r\n(x+1).\r\n\r\nThis gives users fair warning that an RPC is to be removed, and time to change client software if necessary. Deprecation warnings in RPC return values or release notes are easily ignored.\r\n\r\nThis is a more generic version of the approach I tried to use in #10841, which too late to make it into v0.15.",
