I'd like to at least hear others opinions, I'm genuinely interested in what people have say about it before I commit more energy into exploring this subject further.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke Nothing is ever perfect, it would just need to be better than what we have now. Performance is just and engineering problem, distributed AI fee estimation, etc. whereas the black box argument I don't buy. If it's safe to fly a fighter jet or drive a car it's safe to estimate a fee surely. Besides how much random is /dev/random, black box too. I don't mean this to be back and forth discussion. Just wanted to hear peoples gut reaction to the idea.",
