The current situation only save into the wallet one transaction on top of the longest chain, and the downside is that the user see his balance to 0 when he still have funds. The current situation is also counter intuitive: why TX4 get queue by the wallet for later broadcast, but not TX5 ?\r\n\r\nConcept ACK for me.",
