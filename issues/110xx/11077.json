   "body" : "Fixes a couple of bugs from the introduction of TestNode:\r\n\r\n- test scripts were no longer able to specify a custom timeout for\r\nstarting a node. Therefore tests with nodes that take a long time to\r\nstart up (eg pruning.py) would fail.\r\n- the test for whether a node has failed on start up was broken\r\nby changing 'assert x is None' to 'assert not x'. Since\r\nsubprocess.poll() can return None (indicating the node is still running)\r\nor 0 (indicating the node exited with return code 0), this was a\r\nregression.",
