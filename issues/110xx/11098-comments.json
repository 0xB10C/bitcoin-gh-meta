I put the button in an area so that it doesn't take up any vertical space and mess up the appearance of the entire page. It would be possible to put something on the SendCoinEntry(s) instead and send a signal to the SendCoinsDialog instance for example but that was more cluttered visually and in code when I tried it. \r\n\r\n> Also nits, please update to snake_case and modify braces as per style guideline.\r\n\r\nYou'll have to point out where you want me to use snake case...",
