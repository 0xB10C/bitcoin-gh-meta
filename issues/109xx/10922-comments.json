      "body" : "I think you missed something. There are three directories that matter:\r\n* $DATADIR/blocks (raw blocks)\r\n* $DATADIR/blocks/index (LevelDB database with information about raw blocks)\r\n* $DATADIR/chainstate (LevelDB database that holds the UTXO set)\r\n\r\nThe first is high-bandwidth, low IO. The second has hardly any activity at all. The third is where all activity happens, and is critical for performance.\r\n\r\nYou should not separate the blocks from the blocks/index directory, as things may get ugly if they're out of sync. You can however put the chainstate on a faster/smaller device.",

      "body" : "Hi @sipa, thank you very much for the prompt follow up.  Per your feedback, I have updated the doc to explicitly call out that chainstate folder must also stay on a fast (internal) disk.  The \"file-partition.md\" notes I made should describe:\r\n\r\n- Installing $datadir to local internal disk (so \"chainstate\" will never need to move).\r\n- Start/stop bitcoind (though maybe this isn't necessary).\r\n- Move the \"index\" files up one folder level. \r\n- Move the \"blocks\" folder off the internal disk.\r\n- Go to the new external \"blocks\" folder and soft-link back to the new \"index\" location.\r\n- Go to the original internal drive \"data\" location and link the now external \"blocks\" folder.\r\n\r\nAgain, the \"chainstate\" folder remains on the internal disk and never needs to move.\r\n\r\nAgain these \"file-partition.md\" notes are not the direct route I took, but (if correct) might save _the next person_ considerable delay in initial blockchain synchronization.\r\n\r\nTo your point even though these low-capacity/high-IOfrequency LevelDb and high-capacity/low-IOfrequency blockchain files are physically separated on separate disks, _they are kept in sync via the soft links_ created.\r\n\r\n_Maybe ultimately a more natural configuration of these files would be to have the \"index\" folder up a level to start with._  That's what makes moving these folders confusing in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThank you again very much for the prompt feedback, very flattering, thanks.",
