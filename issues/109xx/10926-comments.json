I only mention this in case you need to get a build out quickly, and are running into endless obstacles with cross compiles.  Years ago I did many Unix Auto Tools builds and found cross-compiles to be finicky and frustrating.  I feel for you here -- good luck -- hang in there!  ",

      "body" : "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is only to allow macOS to locate dynamic libraries at **runtime**, basically the same as LD_LIBRARY_PATH works on Unix systems.  So sorry, no, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is not a build environment setting, but a runtime-only setting.\r\n\r\nFor _compile time_ header file location/inclusion, you may look at explicitly setting CPPFLAGS, though this should not really be needed if the Autotools probe is working properly on your system and all dependencies (transitive or otherwise) are all properly in place.   If you do set CPPFLAGS, then you will probably need to set LDFLAGS as well to pick up the corresponding platform libraries.\r\n\r\nReally, the point I was trying to make up above is that I personally found cross compiling to be pretty darn finicky in my professional experience.  Further, some might consider cross-compiling to be outside the purview of Bitcoin-specific questions, and really more of a Unix Autotools-specific question. \r\n\r\nI am suggesting here that you might want to go another route here -- instead of cross-compiling, try building native on macOS.  Especially since sometimes these cross-compile tasks can turn into endless \"onion peeling\" of issue after issue, after issue, whereas native builds can be more straightforward.  In either case you will need runtime environment settings to run natively anyways.  \r\n\r\nFor more on Autotools, see the book:\r\n**_Autotools A Practitioner's Guide to GNU Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool\r\nby John Calcote_** \r\n\r\nGood luck, I feel for you here.\r\n",
