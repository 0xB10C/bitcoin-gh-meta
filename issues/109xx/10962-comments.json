      "body" : "I think that the user base is different for bitcoind and bitcoin-qt. Users\nof the daemon interact through json and are likely familiar with technical\nEnglish. Though, gui users (often windows users) are not familiar with the\ncommand line and some of them might have difficulties understanding the\ntechnical English.\n\nThe solution would be to make the translatable strings as easy to\nunderstand as possible. In case this is not possible and it takes several\nlines to explain a single command-line option, it is probably best to not\nexpose it to the average user anyway.\n\nOn Mon, Jul 31, 2017 at 4:52 PM, Wladimir J. van der Laan <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> A curious property of the current client is that command-line help (--help)\n> will be translated when doing bitcoin-qt --help but not for bitcoind\n> --help.
