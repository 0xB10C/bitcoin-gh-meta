      "body" : "@laanwj  Thanks for reviewing, good to finally get some comments about this :)\r\nIt sounds reasonable to keep some minimal self-contained documentation, I updated the commit.  \r\n\r\nThere is also the question about some of text being misplaced. Phrases like \"Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system...\" and \"Bitcoin Core is the original Bitcoin client...\" seem to be misplaced at this level in the tree. I think they are an heritage from before QT was merged upstream. These intro/setup texts are still removed in the updated commit.\r\n\r\nAfter this, `README_windows.txt` contains only duplication, but removal causes Gitian build failure. This should be adressed but maybe in another PR.\r\n\r\nPlease re-review.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
