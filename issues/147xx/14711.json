   "body" : "This change removes uses of `chainActive` and `mapBlockIndex` globals in wallet code. It is a refactoring change which does not affect external behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is the next step in the larger #10973 refactoring change, which removes all other accesses to node global variables from wallet code. Doing this is useful to provide a better defined interface between the wallet and node, and necessary to allow wallet and node code to run in separate processes in #10102.",
