I think `tis-interpreter` is the only good tool catching this class of UB. May I ask how you found this issue?\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see we unconditionally hit this UB as part of startup no matter what parameters we pass to `bitcoind` :-\\\r\n\r\nWhy this is UB: Assuming `char foo[N];` then calculating `foo + n` is UB if `n` is not in the range `0 <= n <= N`. Calculating one past the end (`n=N`) is OK (but we may not dereference).",
