      "body" : "> I noticed one of my wallets shows that I own funds that I really don't. \r\n\r\nHow can I reproduce it?\r\n\r\n> It turns out that 'importprunedfunds' only allows you to import txs which credit an address owned by your wallet. It won't let you import txs which spend from addresses owned by your wallet.\r\n\r\nSounds interesting and also never used this RPC command. Reading the things mentioned here: https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/0.21.0/rpc/wallet/importprunedfunds/ still not sure when does this help users.\r\n\r\n> I made the following change and then was able to import the missing transaction:\r\n\r\nIf this resolves the issue and doesn't break anything else, maybe a PR can be created for it?",
