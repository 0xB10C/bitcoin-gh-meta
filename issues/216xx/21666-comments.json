But it looks like [I'm not even using that](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/4/commits/cae34ecf1c8f144538dd6f1a971656a7736e2596#diff-0d3cbc3ea928ac8ca177e43600b13c4f1866ec889c06b2ba5925af1535d108e0R54). I'll bring it back if I need it. \r\n\r\nHow did you find the includes that were needed for `add missing includes to external signer code`?\r\n\r\nWith regards to c8f469c it may be useful to catch HWI specific errors in the GUI in order to present more actionable advise, but we can revert if needed. For now the GUI just throws rather useless \"Can't list signers\" / \"Sign failed\" / \"Can't display address\" messages anyway.",
