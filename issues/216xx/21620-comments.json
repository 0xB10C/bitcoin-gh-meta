Also annotating CChainState::m_chain in 8257e9ab7592a7fe459089f021053c7740004817 makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nThe thing I don't understand is what bug is prevented by making `m_active_chainstate` `std::atomic<CChainState*>` instead of `CChainState*`? What bugs are prevented by adding `LOCK(m_cs_chainstates);` or having `m_cs_chainstates` exist at all?\r\n\r\nNot putting EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED(cs_main) on ChainstateManager methods seems like Six Flags saying congratulations, we're waiving the $100 fee to get into the park, we're just going to charge you $100 the first time you get onto any ride. It seems like this could only be appealing if you wanted to go to a `CChainState` theme park without trying any rides (accessing any data inside).\r\n",
