This can be a process that can take multiple days as the [Bitcoin block chain](https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size) has grown to more than 15 gigabytes, and is growing almost a gigabyte every month. Luckily there is a safe and fast way to speed up this process. WeÃ¢ÂÂll show you how to bootstrap your blockchain to bring your client up to speed in just a few simple steps.\n+\n+### Requirements\n+\n+- A fresh install of the Bitcoin client software.\n+- An empty wallet. This is very important as pending transactions in an existing wallet can get lost!\n+\n+### Download the blockchain via Bittorent\n+\n+Jeff Garzik, Bitcoin core developer, offers an [torrent file](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=145386.0) for bootstrapping purposes that is updated often. Bittorrent is a protocol that speeds up the downloading of large files by using the other clients in the network. Example free and safe open-source clients are [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/) or [QBittorent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/). A guide to installing and configuring the torrent clients can be found [here](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/UserGuide) for Deluge and [here](http://qbforums.shiki.hu/) for QBittorent. A further in-depth tutorial on Bittorent can be found [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31846/bittorrent-for-beginners-how-get-started-downloading-torrents/).\n+\n+With the client installed weÃ¢ÂÂll proceed to download the blockchain torrent file.

Be sure not to have an actively used wallet in use. Now we are going to copy the download of the blockchain to the Bitcoin client data directory.

Congratulations you have successfully imported the blockchain!\n+\n+### Is this safe?\n+Yes, the above method is safe. The download contains only raw block chain data and the client verifies this on import.

Be sure not to have an actively used wallet in use. Now we are going to copy the download of the blockchain to the Bitcoin client data directory. You should run the client software at least once so it can generate the data directory. Copy the downloaded bootstrap.dat file into the Bitcoin data folder.",
