      "body" : "Brought Bitcoin-Qt back up and let it synch with the network.  No problem.  So I started importing my private keys (I started with a clean wallet).  After about 5 importprivkey commands, I noticed that Bitcoin-Qt was no longer responsive.  Same symptoms as above.  I think the problem is related to RPC commands in general since I also saw a hang with bitcoind when I was just issuing getblockcount commands.",

Anyways, I found out that you can tell importprivkey not to rescan, so I'll do that and then do a single rescan after all of the keys have been entered.",
