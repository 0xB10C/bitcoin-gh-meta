The janitor scans and removes memory pool transactions\r\nolder than current time minus -janitorexpire seconds.\r\n\r\nBy default, janitor runs every 24 hrs, expiring TXs older than 72 hrs [and have failed to make it into a block in that time].\r\n\r\nIsMine() transactions are not touched.\r\n\r\nThis is *intentionally crude*: easily reviewed, reasoned and tested; fitting easily within the current framework, or being backported to an older bitcoind.  A key goal was *not* rewriting mempool.\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n\r\n* One alternative implementation was considered:\r\n```\r\n     while (mempool byte size > limit)\r\n            expire oldest !ismine\r\n```\r\nThis would work, but require a sort step, as mempool is not time-ordered.  There is also the question of how often to run such a while{} loop, likely leading to some sort of high-water/low-water system.\r\n\r\nThe sweep implementation presented seemed more straightforward.\r\n",
