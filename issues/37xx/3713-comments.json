It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5.

Not sure where it's documented, but it's too late to switch the private key representations now. In my experience all software supports at least the base58-based bitcoind `importprivkey`/`dumpprivkey` format for individual keys.\r\n\r\nAgreed that if bitcoin was designed today I'd vote for anything but Base58. However that ship has sailed.\r\n",
