On this issue though perhaps you can tentatively start answering the questions you pose @ariard to move this forward.

Note that the set of vulnerabilities (money loss, timevalue DoS, \"contract cancelling\", ...) is different in function of each protocol (CoinSwap, Lightning, DLC, ...).  Maybe we can translate the gist as a dev wiki page ?\r\n\r\nW.r.t to questions, answering them is function of the L2 protocol considered (CoinSwap, Lightning, DLC, ...). What I can do is write down a tx-jamming analysis for the main ones.\r\n\r\nAbout standardness malleability, see logs : https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/P2P-IRC-meetings#topic-reducing-cve-2020-26895-class-of-bugs-and-tx-standardness-ariard, where the majority opinion (which I adhere too now) is that there is no such thing as \"bitcoin's tx relay rules\". So in the future, the burden would be more on L2 protocol designer to make the less assumptions possible on their transaction formats.\r\n\r\nAnyway, tx-relay jamming/mempool congestion fault-tolerance for L2 protocols is a wide subject, I'm glad to get help.",
