      "body" : "Because bans have specific durations I'm not sure if this is a good change.  Should a 1 hour ban of foo/16 stop you from adding a 1 year ban of foo/24? \r\n\r\nRight now I already have to undo every ban before adding it to make sure it's not rejected and as a result ends up expiring prematurely.  But if any wider banned blocked every narrower ban, I'm not sure how I could programmatically handle that.  I'd have to have crazy logic interrogated the banlist and broke every larger ban into smaller ones when a smaller one with a different time period was added.\r\n\r\nInstead, I think it should just be consistent in that each ban doesn't interact with an different ban. And when I add a ban for an already existing prefix, it should extend the ban if the new one has a later expiration time.  It would be fine to canonicalize actually equivalent bans (e.g. 1.2.3.4/24 = 1.2.3.0/24).",

I can't see either how clients will be able to make tooling with sane logic. I am going to think this through and update the PR with a better solution.
