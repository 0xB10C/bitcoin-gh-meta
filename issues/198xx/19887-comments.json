This seems like a bug, as the wallet should mark them as soon as they are submitted.\r\n\r\n* Or, it seems the issue is that the wallet waits for the mempool to be loaded, in which case the txs in the wallet are only marked as in-mempool when they went through the validationinterfacequeue? In that case it could make sense to fixup the comment `wait until the wallet has submitted all transacti...` to `wait until the mempool is loaded`. (I added the wrong comment, but this pull is somewhat related, so could fix up the comment in one go)",
