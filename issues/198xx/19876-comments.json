I don't think that returning NullUniValue is the correct way to handle this error.",

Initially, I was hoping I could fix the test and the underlying race issue in one PR but since the race fix is a bit more complicated I think it makes sense to split it from the test fix, so the CI failures stop as fast as possible.
