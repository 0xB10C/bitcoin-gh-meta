See comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#pullrequestreview-281092623, specifically this part: \r\n\r\n>Reworked the outbound eviction logic so that we'll evict block-relay-only peers that fail the nMinimumChainWork test, but protect them otherwise.\r\n\r\nSo that was the intended behavior and what I think the reviewers of the PR understood as well; in my opinion the simplest fix is to correct the comments in the code to reflect that.",
