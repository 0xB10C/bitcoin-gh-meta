      "body" : "I tried to replicate your setup (under macOS) by deleting most of the local data in `blocks` and creating identically named symlinks to my external drive and was able to reproduce your issue: Not the blockdata (`blk` and `rev` files), but the LevelDB Index folder is quite unhappy with symlinks. As soon a I symlinked the single files in `index` folder, I wasnÂ´t able to run bitcoind and received the same error like you.\r\nSolution: DonÂ´t symlink the files inside `index`, but symlink the whole folder instead (`ln -s /path/to/blocks/index index` inside of your `blocks` folder) âï¸ ",
