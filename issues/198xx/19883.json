   "body" : "This is a smaller, client-focused alternative to #19725 that exposes `conn_type` via a practical API for JSON-RPC consumers.\r\n\r\n- returns the `conn_type` as an integer id, which is more practical to parse for API clients than matching on a bunch of strings that are also more likely to change. API clients will at any rate need to write a connection types enum and enum-to-string methods in their code; let's provide them an API that makes it easier.\r\n- returns a `conn_type_name` as a convenience method for humans; this can be dropped if not needed\r\n- returns these fields just after the related `inbound` and `addnode` fields\r\n- places code for presentation concerns in `rpc/net.cpp` rather than in `net.{h,cpp}`\r\n- adds a `uint8_t` type to the `ConnectionType` enum class; if preferred, this can be dropped\r\n- provides a well-formatted `getpeerinfo` help doc\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./src/bitcoin-cli help getpeerinfo\r\n...\r\n    \"inbound\" : true|false,        (boolean) Inbound (true) or Outbound (false)\r\n    \"addnode\" : true|false,        (boolean) Whether connection was due to addnode/-connect or if it was an automatic/inbound connection\r\n    \"conn_type\" : n,               (numeric) Connection type between 0 and 5:\r\n                                   0 - inbound (initiated by the peer)\r\n                                   1 - outbound-full-relay (default automatic connections)\r\n                                   2 - manual (added using the -addnode/-connect configuration options or the addnode RPC)\r\n                                   3 - feeler (short-lived automatic connection to test addresses)\r\n                                   4 - block-relay-only (does not relay transactions or addresses)\r\n                                   5 - addr-fetch (short-lived automatic connection to request addresses)\r\n    \"conn_type_name\" : \"str\",      (string) Connection type name: inbound, outbound-full-relay, manual, feeler, block-relay-only, addr-fetch\r\n```",
