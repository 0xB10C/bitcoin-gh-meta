If many of our peers are Sybils, it also would improve the chance of not connecting to the same netgroup.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the work in this PR, I think we better select them as diverse as we can. If an attacker is capable to influence this selection, making it less diverse (by dropping one of the checks) won't really help neither with the robustness of these selected connections nor with their privacy.",
