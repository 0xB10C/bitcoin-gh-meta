I think it is unreasonable to expect that ordinary users should do that interpretation even if we assume this would be a \"alarm should go off\" situation.\r\n\r\n_If_ this is something we want to warn about we should do it in a more clear and unambiguous way :)",

I'd take it ever further though, and add an (optional) logging severity (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR or similar) that can be added to all log messages.
