I think it is unreasonable to expect that ordinary users should do that interpretation even if we assume this would be a \"alarm should go off\" situation.\r\n\r\n_If_ this is something we want to warn about we should do it in a more clear and unambiguous way :)",

It's hard to know--I *think* I'd be more worried about network topology here than a peer causing lots of logging, but I'm not sure if that POV is correct or shared.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of looking at the `NET` logging to see if we should consider creating a \"high level\" net logging category (or a \"user level\" one) as opposed to the low-level one with all of the invs and other hundreds/thousands of messages per minute.
