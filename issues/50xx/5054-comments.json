It will have the scope of the current statement only.\r\n\r\nIsn't the root issue then that some functions assume that a const reference that is passed has a longer validity than the function call? Not the implicit conversion itself?\r\n\r\nIe if a function takes a `const std::string &`, this could be a temporary converted from a `const char*`. There is nothing inherently dangerous in this except if the callee assumes that the caller will keep the reference alive instead of making a copy.\r\n\r\nIMO if the goal is to pass a  longer-living structure, I don't think references are the right thing to use. Using a pointer will avoid any implicit conversions, and documents that something potentially dangerous is going on (and you need reference counting, or ownership transfer, or at least make it clear what the scope is). Or if acceptable, just make a copy.\r\n",

We could even make that a style rule. If we did, when we \"assume that a reference that is passed to a function outlives that function\"  either by mistake or due to a conscientious decision based purely on performance (and no, just like  performance is not always more important than appropriate semantics, style is not always more important than performance). And although in my preferred language \"explicit is better than implicit\", I don't think it's fair to blame C++ in this case when it provides a specific keyword to avoid the explosions.\r\nIn any case, I will use a copy in #4989 and its continuations as suggested, maintaining that branch independent from this one (I'm mostly reffering to https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/tree/libscriptpreview a rewrite of #4809 on top of this and the latest changes). The penalty shouldn't be very big anyway and it can always be optimized later.
