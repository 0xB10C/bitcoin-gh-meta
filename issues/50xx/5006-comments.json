Is this just an updated snapshot, or does it include some of the more extensive tests that have been discussed lately?\r\n\r\nAlso, it's going to need a distinct file-name, otherwise this will clash with the next update. Could you please append the upstream revision to the jar's filename, so that we can keep track of what this build corresponds to? Notice how #4837 used pull-tests-$($(package)_version).jar for the file-name, which addresses both concerns at once.",
