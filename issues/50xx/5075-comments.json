Equally in some cases being able to guarantee all transactions are public is a must. (in other cases you want the exact opposite!)\r\n\r\nThe colored coin standard I'm working on will be able to encode color amount/movement info into any PUSHDATA in the transaction specifically so we aren't tied to OP_RETURN, e.g. for sending colored coins to a stealth address. So removing restrictions on OP_RETURN will enable these protocols to avoid creating unspendable outputs in some cases.",
