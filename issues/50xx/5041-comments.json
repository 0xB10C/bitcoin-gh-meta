I assumed that there would be some calls we could make before/after initiating some network activity (not that it would be useful for us, probably, given the nature of p2p), but I was disappointed in the documentation.\r\n\r\nBasically, I would like to know how a network-heavy application _should_ work with AppNap without disabling it, if only for my own edification. Have you stumbled onto anything along those lines?",
