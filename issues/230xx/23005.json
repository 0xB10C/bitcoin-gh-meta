   "body" : "Delay wallet client construction until after logging, thread and other init for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- More responsive multiprocess GUI startup. When bitcoin-gui is started this moves the call from bitcoin-gui to bitcoin-node that spawns bitcoin-wallet off of the GUI event thread and onto the background GUI init executor thread.\r\n\r\n- Avoids feature_logging.py test failures with bitcoin-node by making bitcoin-wallet logging start after bitcoin-node logging starts,\r\n  because the tests are not written to handle the bitcoin-wallet logging init code running first.\r\n\r\nThis partially reverts commit b266b3e0bf29d0f3d5deaeec62d57c5025b35525, moving wallet client creation back to the place it was located before.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [process separation project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/projects/10).\r\n",
