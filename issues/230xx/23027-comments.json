Even if Github, Appveyor and DrahtBot are all wrong about there being a conflict, if this PR can't be merged using the [merge-script](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools/blob/master/github-merge.py) (it currently can't), it's not going to be merged. The fact that no CI is running is also a blocker. I'd suggest rebasing on a master more recent than April 2020.",
