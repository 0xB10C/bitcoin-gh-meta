   "body" : "This PR updates the nanobench with the latest release from upstream, v4.3.6. It fixes the missing performance counters.\r\n\r\nDue to discussions on #22999 I have done some work that should make the benchmark results more reliable. It introduces a new flag `-min_duration_ms` that allows to run a benchmark for much longer then the default. When results are unreliable, choosing a large timeframe here should usually get repeatable results even when frequency scaling cannot be disabled. The default is now 10ms. For this to work I have changed the `AddrManGood` and `EvictionProtection` benchmarks so they work with any number of iterations.\r\n\r\nAlso, this adds more usage documentation to `bench_bitcoin -h` and I've cherry-picked two changes from #22999 authored by @jonatack",
