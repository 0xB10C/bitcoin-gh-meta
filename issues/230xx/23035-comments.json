      "body" : "Concept ACK, approach NACK. I don't think it makes sense to add this addrman-specific data into the `CAddress` class, which is used by many different components.\r\n\r\n> Two ways to expose them are (1) move them from CAddrInfo to CAddress or (2) use CAddrInfo instead of CAddress for the GetAddr_(), GetAddr() and GetAddresses() functions and callers.\r\n\r\nI don't think we want to do (2) either. In general, we're trying to encapsulate addrman more. `CAddrInfo` is an addrman implementation-specific class, so ideally it wouldn't be exposed at all in the header. That's done in #22950, which introduces a very clear compilation firewall between implementation and public interface.\r\n\r\nI think the best way to do this is update `CAddrMan::GetAddr()` to return a vector of tuples, `std::vector<std::tuple<CAddress, /* tried */ bool, /* refcount*/ int>>`, similar to how `Select()` is updated to return a `std::pair<>` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22950/files#diff-164bd9e2e30f54d0a79eb7cc372309e2f2155edc6c3f051290ab078f03f6a771R89. That means that the public method is returning only what the caller needs, minimizing the coupling between implementation and client code.",
