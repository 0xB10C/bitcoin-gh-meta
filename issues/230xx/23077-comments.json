I.e. to make CJDNS a first class citizen network like IPv4, IPv6, Tor and I2P.\r\n\r\nThanks for providing this motivation, it's helpful to understand the aim of this PR. Could you go a bit further and share your perspective on _why_ you think CJDNS should be a first class citizen network in bitcoin core? Does it provide different features / privacy / etc. from other networks? Or is this a case where you think optionality is good, so supporting more networks is better? Thanks in advance!",

      "body" : "@prayank23, @amitiuttarwar,\r\n\r\nCompared to IPv4/6, CJDNS provides e2e encryption and protects nodes from the traditional traffic analysis and filtering. For example, an ISP blocks port 8333 (dumb) or analyses the traffic to/from a given node, regardless of the port (it is easy to detect that it is Bitcoin P2P protocol being talked on a TCP connection, even if the port is not 8333).\r\n\r\nCompared to Tor and I2P, CJDNS provides redundancy. Each of those have their own shades, which may suit different users. For example Tor is popular/widespread but is somewhat centralized, which could lead to [problems](https://darknetdaily.com/2021/01/09/all-v3-onion-addresses-down-after-attack-on-the-tor-network/). I2P connections have source address, but I2P is somewhat slow. CJDNS does not hide the sender and the recipient from intermediate routers, but it is fast. Different things may work for different people. It is good to have options.\r\n\r\nSo, why not have support for CJDNS? It must be noted that support for X does not come for free. We have to pay the following prices:\r\n* Implementation cost\r\n* Review cost\r\n* Maintenance cost\r\n\r\nFor the _implementation cost_, notice that CJDNS is already included in [BIP155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki#specification) and that there is already rudimentary support for it in `master`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git grep -i cjdns origin/master |wc -l\r\n      49\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result this PR is relatively small and straight-forward. _Review cost_ should be low. From the application's point of view, connecting to CJDNS is as easy as connecting to a normal IPv6 address. Bitcoin Core need not implement support for a specific proxy that talks a specific protocol. Tor and I2P require that. We have this maintenance cost for them:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ wc -l src/torcontrol.cpp src/i2p.cpp \r\n     636 src/torcontrol.cpp\r\n     418 src/i2p.cpp\r\n```\r\n\r\nSupport for CJDNS goes without that, so its _maintenance cost_ is low compared to Tor and I2P.\r\n\r\nNotice also that [OpenWRT routers support CJDNS](https://openwrt.org/packages/pkgdata/cjdns), so from user's perspective it would be a matter of enabling it on their routers and running Bitcoin Core with `-cjdnsreachable`.\r\n\r\nIn the case of CJDNS, my personal opinion is that the benefits outweigh the cost.
