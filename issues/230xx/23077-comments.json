I.e. to make CJDNS a first class citizen network like IPv4, IPv6, Tor and I2P.\r\n\r\nThanks for providing this motivation, it's helpful to understand the aim of this PR. Could you go a bit further and share your perspective on _why_ you think CJDNS should be a first class citizen network in bitcoin core? Does it provide different features / privacy / etc. from other networks? Or is this a case where you think optionality is good, so supporting more networks is better? Thanks in advance!",
