Why can't this nonsensical operator on scripts be marked deleted in favour of self-documenting ones like `def push_data(self, vch)`, `def push_opcode(self, op)` or so? This way, script operations are easier to follow, but byte operations are not ruled out because (if needed) they can still be done by casting to bytes first.",
