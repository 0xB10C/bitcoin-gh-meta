I uploaded some progress but it doesn't fully resolve the issue, so please feel free to continue working on this if you're still interested.\r\n\r\nMy first PR addresses the `wait_for_getdata` part.  However, there are still additional changes needed to fully resolve this issue:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update `wait_for_getheaders` to check the locator hash(es)\r\n- [ ] Remove calls to `pop(\"getdata\")` and `pop(\"getheaders\")` that are no longer needed\r\n\r\nI need to think more about the best way to identify the correct locator hash when calling `wait_for_getheaders`.  My initial attempt was to use the `getbestblockhash` RPC, but it seemed to cause too much of a slowdown.  I'd also welcome any discussion / suggestions about how best to approach this.",
