   "body" : "Instead of changing some actions' behavior based on `IsWalletFlagSet(WALLET_FLAG_DISABLE_PRIVATE_KEYS)`, make separate things that work with no private keys. In particular, instead of having `bumpfee` give out a psbt when there are no private keys, add a `psbtbumpfee` RPC that always gives out a psbt and just have `bumpfee` be disabled when there are no private keys. This is mirrored in the GUI bumpfee menu items. Additionally, instead of changing the `Send` button to `Create Unsigned` when there are no private keys, just always have a `Create Unsigned` button and disable `Send` when there are no private keys. To deal with `bumpfee` already doing the mutated behavior thing, that behavior is hidden behind a `-deprecatedrpc=bumpfee` option.\r\n\r\nTo make the GUI stuff easier to follow, test, and review, this is being based on #17509",
