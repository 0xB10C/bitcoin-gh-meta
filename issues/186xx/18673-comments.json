Those files had this issue as a pre-existing condition and this is not something that can be solved by `clang-format`. The original author of the test should have take care of it. I am not going to touch files that are not already touched by this pull request and if you think this is a worthy task, it can be done as a follow-up cleanup for the other files. I am happy to review and ACK, but I think the goal of this pull should not be extended further than solving a workflow issue of devs writing tests and using `clang-format`.",
