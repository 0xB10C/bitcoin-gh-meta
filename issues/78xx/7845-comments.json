      "body" : "Okay, after some debugging I've tracked this down to the call to `TryCreateDirectory` in `GetDefaultDataDir` in `src/util.cpp`. It's not actually clear why for OS X (and just OS X) a function to return a default path should actually try to create that path Ã¢ÂÂ surely that should be done elsewhere and only if necessary to put files within that dir. Anyway, this seems to be the problem... though I can't guarantee it's the only point of failure, it's likely to be the main one.\r\n\r\nDo you think we can get this fixed promptly and a new release out, or at least a Git tag? Cheers.",
