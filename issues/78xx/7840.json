This makes sense, as they are subject to very different behaviour: we want blocks to relay as fast as possible, while transactions are subject to rate limiting, deduplication, and source obscurity.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, we can turn the tx queue into a set, and use it to prevent the mempool command from leaking unannounced transactions.\r\n\r\nBased on top of  #7805.",
