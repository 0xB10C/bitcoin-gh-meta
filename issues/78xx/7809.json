   "body" : "1. Fix the annoying \"unexpected operator\" warning that shows up sometimes.\r\n2. Fix download fallbacks. Fixes #7627.\r\n3. Make sure to check all necessary checksums for cctools/qt.\r\n4. Ensure (make a good guess) that the host/build toolchains haven't changed since the previous build. If they have, invalidate the necessary packages.\r\n5. Add a salt option for adding extra info to 4. This would allow us to (for example) seed gitian packages with dpkg info, in order to invalidate the cache if certain conditions were met.\r\n\r\nI'm pushing these all in one PR because most of these changes will cause full cache invalidation, so we may as well try to only do it once.",
