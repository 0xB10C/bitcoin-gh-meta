This will take very long and I won't do it alone. Probably nobody with bitcoin development experience will think this is a priority. I don't either.\r\nOn the other hand, I'm pretty convinced that everybody agrees with this in general, and if I'm wrong we should soon find out.\r\n\r\nYou may be interested in this PR because:\r\n\r\n1) You are a developer, but you're not familiar with git (or mercurial or similar), or you are intimidated about contributing to Bitcoin Core for whatever reason. I've done it. I'm trying to be here to show you you can too (without coma between 2 \"yous\", if that's allowed in enligsh).\r\n2) You are interested in my PROMISES*\r\n3) You just want to get one commit merged in github/bitcoin/bitcoin because you have an interview in the evening, I don't care if you help me.\r\n4) @rustyrussell told me nobody would ever read the forth point in a numbered list.\r\n\r\nWhat would you have to do:\r\n\r\nSimple: force me to remove TODO lines from this PR.\r\n\r\nPROMISES:\r\n\r\nIf you force me to replace any TODO line in this PR, and you're open for nits in your own PR, I promise:\r\n\r\n- I will review your PR and nack soon or nit until I can give a no-test-needed ACK (or an utACK [the former is better]).\r\n- Please ping me on this PR, or on your own for anything related to this.\r\n\r\nOnce a month (at least):\r\n\r\n- collect nits and solve them\r\n- I will incorporate open PRs that remove TODOs from this mission.\r\n- I will rebase anything that's needed if the maintainer can't do it from my base to my-next-month-base, every month\r\n- I will try to attract more review to your PR. \r\n- You will just need patience some times.\r\n\r\nping @djpnewton \r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Trivial: Globals: Explicitly pass const CChainParams& to ProcessMessage() #7828\r\n- [ ] Someone else is going to do or rebase something else.\r\n\r\n@laanwj please, take this as an open issue that is going to last for long. Just with code [but, still, never to merge no matter how much I change it].\r\n\r\n",
