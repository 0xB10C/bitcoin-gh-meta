If so, it indeed should do this directly through SOCKS, and not by first looking up the name using DNS, as this exposes the host name to anyone listening for DNS requests.\r\n\r\nEdit: DNS lookups *should* be only used when `-dns` is passed (which sets `fAllowDNS`). In practice, it always does DNS lookups for showmyip.com etc when determining the external IP address, and when lookup up the IRC server (!) irc.lfnet.org.\r\n",

(e.g. lots of apps can be configured to use a proxy but still end up using the libc resolver and then deanonymizing data leaks out via DNS, tor can't see the leak but it can see connections to IPs instead of names)\r\nFor the most part we don't use DNSÃ¢ÂÂ the exceptions being the stuff mentioned above and DNSSeed which can't be usefully done using tor's integrated dns (see the other issue I opened on dnsseed+tor). \r\nWe should make sure to use dns via tor for the things where we do dns and disable showmyip when using tor (dnsseed is now disabled already)\r\nUnfortunately that warning will remain, but after those things are fixed the warning will be completely bogus and I don't think there is anything we can do about that. :(\r\n",
