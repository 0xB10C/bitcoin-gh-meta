During a second start-up, all old addr entries are removed (using CDB::Rewrite).\r\n * It is faster in the sense that all locking issues involving CAddrDB and cs_mapAddresses are gone, and address-operations are fast. Reaching 8 connections may be a bit slower, as the new code much less strongly favors trying recently seen addresses - that is the price to pay for some protection against sybil attacks. When connection count is low, it will however favor self-tried addresses.\r\n* Yes, booting from seed nodes is no problem.\r\n\r\nThe main thing to be tested is whether the bucket count (256 and 64) and bucket size (64) are large enough, knowing that they do not get quickly filled completely. For example, a new-style addr.dat of a week old, will it easily find connections when ran using -noirc -nodnsseed -nolisten?\r\n",
