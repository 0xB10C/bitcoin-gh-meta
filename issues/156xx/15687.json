   "body" : "This pull request adds test coverage in `test/functional/tool_wallet.py` to reproduce unexpected writes to the wallet as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15608 and serve as a benchmark for fixing the issue:\r\n\r\n- Wallet tool `info` unexpectedly writes to the wallet file if the wallet file permissions are read/write.\r\n\r\n- Wallet tool `info` raises with \"Error loading . Is wallet being used by another process?\" if the wallet file permissions are read-only.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n\r\n1. Reproduce the reported issue, define the current unexpected behavior, and add test coverage to guide a future fix. Detailed logging is provided for sanity checking in addition to commented-out assertions that should be uncommented when fixing the issue. Once the issue is resolved some of the logging can be removed.\r\n\r\n2. Provisionally extend the same coverage to wallet tool `create` and to `getwalletinfo` as regression tests.\r\n\r\n3. Add log messages as there are currently none in the test file.\r\n\r\n4. Poll interest and feasibility in fixing this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks to Marco Falke for pointing me in the right direction.",
