The former is done in practice (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15555, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14902) and the latter addresses the discussion here yesterday: https://x0f.org/web/statuses/101753569204220416.\r\n\r\n- Create a release notes draft wiki for collaborative editing at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki as seen for v0.17.0 and the current v0.18.0 release.\r\n\r\n- As per http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2019-03-28.html#l-342, for the period during which the release notes are being edited on the wiki, the version on the branch should be wiped and replaced with a link to the wiki which should be used for all announcements until final.\r\n\r\n- Before final, remove the \"Needs release note\" label from relevant PRs/issues and merge the release notes from the wiki into the branch.\r\n\r\n- Steal/adapt/merge in the updates in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15692.\r\n\r\n- Expanded introductory explanation in `release-notes.md`.\r\n",
