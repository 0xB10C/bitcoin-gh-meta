The former is done in practice (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15555, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/14902) and the latter addresses the discussion here yesterday: https://x0f.org/web/statuses/101753569204220416.\r\n\r\n- Mention creating a Release Notes draft wiki for collaborative editing at https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki as seen for v0.17.0 and the current v0.18.0 release.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this PR if too trivial or to suggest changes. Cheers.",
