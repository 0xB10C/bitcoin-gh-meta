There may be several (conflicting) pre-signed txs spending it and as soon as it is spent, all entities with ownership in it want to check which pre-signed tx spent the coin.\r\nIf they use Bitcoin Core to monitor the coin, they may use:\r\n* A watch-only wallet (which requires a file on disk and BDB/Sqlite)\r\n* Walk the raw chain and raw mempool themselves (According to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24408#issuecomment-1059188351 this is doable for the chain, but may not be for the mempool)\r\n* Use an index. A blockfilterindex might speed up scanning the chain, whereas this index directly gives the answer.",
