   "body" : "This PR adds a very basic test for the signet miner script (contrib/signet/miner). It is based on #24553 which fixes a bug (and was also the motivation to write this test).\r\n\r\nThe test roughly follows the steps from https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Signet#Custom_Signet, except that the challenge key-pair is created solely with the test framework. Calibration is also skipped, the difficulty is simply set to the first mainnet target `0x1d00ffff` (see also https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/57186).\r\n\r\nThings to be improved in the future:\r\n* only works with legacy wallet right now, since it relies on the `importprivkey` to import the issuer's private key; not sure yet how this could be solved with descriptor wallets\r\n* determination of `bitcoin-util` path (needed to pass as grinding tool to the miner) and skipping of the test if it's not found are kind of hacky; ideally the test framework should provide a `.skip_if_no_bitcoin_util()` method and a way to find out it's path",
