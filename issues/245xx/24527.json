   "body" : "The change of `consensus.SegwitHeight` from 0 to 1 for regtest in #22818 had the effect that if I create a regtest enviroment with  current master (or 23.x), and then try to load this chain with an older version (22.x), I get an InitError\r\n`Witness data for blocks after height 0 requires validation. Please restart with -reindex` \r\nand have to reindex because `BLOCK_OPT_WITNESS` is no longer set for the Genesis block and `NeedsRedownload()` in validation returns `true` with an older version.\r\nThat might be a bit annoying for tests that use a shared regtest dir with different versions.\r\n\r\nIf people think this is enough of an issue to be worth fixing, I think it should also make it into 23.x",
