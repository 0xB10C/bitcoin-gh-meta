Looking through the full test, it _seems_ like you could use `MiniWallet`, but it's definitely a bigger change than the few lines I did here. Selfishly, I'd prefer making the small change now to unblock myself on a bigger PR I'm working on for coin selection, and then come back to this one later and re-write it to use `MiniWallet` in a follow-up PR.",
