Previously created txs will likely broadcast at some point and the balance returns to normal.\r\n* Now a user would see coin selection fail, but have an accurate balance.\r\n\r\nIn both cases the user will see coin selection fail, so it seems the underlying user problem still exists. Though, it is probably fine to postpone a fix for that until after #11887, in which case this pull can be reverted again.",

The current behavior also leads to user confusion about their balance.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n> I think \"insufficient funds\" is the right message to return if you're unable to produce a transaction that would be accepted by your mempool.\r\n\r\nI think \"insufficient funds\" is too generic of an error message for coin selection failures as there are a ton of different reasons why coin selection might fail. I would like to have more granular error messages, but changing that is orthogonal to this.",
