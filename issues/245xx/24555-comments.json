All participants use addresses from\n+the `fc00::/8` network (reserved IPv6 range). Installation and configuration is\n+done outside of Bitcoin Core, similarly to a VPN (either in the host/OS or on\n+the network router).\n+\n+Compared to IPv4/IPv6, CJDNS provides end-to-end encryption and protects nodes\n+from traffic analysis and filtering.\n+\n+Used with Tor and I2P, CJDNS is a complementary option that can enhance network\n+redundancy and robustness for both the Bitcoin network and the individual node.\n+\n+Each network has different characteristics. For instance, Tor is widely used but\n+somewhat centralized. I2P connections have a source address and I2P is slow.\n+CJDNS is fast but does not hide the sender and the recipient from intermediate\n+routers.\n+\n+## Installing CJDNS and connecting to the network\n+\n+To install and set up CJDNS, follow the instructions at\n+https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns#cjdns.\n+\n+Don't skip steps\n+[\"2. Find a friend\"](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns#2-find-a-friend) and\n+[\"3. Connect your node to your friend's\n+node\"](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns#3-connect-your-node-to-your-friends-node).\n+You need to be connected to the CJDNS network before it will work with your\n+Bitcoin Core node.\n+\n+Typically, CJDNS might be launched with `./cjdroute < cjdroute.conf >",
