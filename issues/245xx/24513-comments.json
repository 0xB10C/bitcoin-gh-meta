The reason/question is, are expressions/words like \"chain state\", \"fee rate\", and \"block hash\" each one word or two? For me, and maybe for people not closely familiar since years with Bitcoin development, they are two words--at least originally, which I guess is why there are classes in the codebase like CChainState and CFeeRate. I usually grep case-indifferently anyway, so this wouldn't change anything (if it doesn't break anything). Just one weakly held light opinion.",

I beg: give it a bit of a rest, we have so many other things that are crying for our attention and our resolve.
