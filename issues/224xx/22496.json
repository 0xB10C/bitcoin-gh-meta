   "body" : "PRs #22112 and #22179 added hotfix code to addrman to remove invalid addresses and mutate the ports of I2P entries after entering into addrman. Those hotfixes included at least two addrman data corruption bugs:\r\n\r\n- #22467 (Assertion `nRndPos1 < vRandom.size() && nRndPos2 < vRandom.size()' failed)\r\n- #22470 (Changing I2P ports in addrman may wronly skip some entries from \"new\" buckets)\r\n\r\nHotfixing addrman is inherently dangerous. There are many members that have implicit assumptions on each others' state, and mutating those directly can lead to violating addrman's internal invariants.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to hotfix addrman, just don't insert any invalid addresses. For now, those are addresses which fail `CNetAddr::IsValid()`, or any I2P addresses where port != 0.",
