   "body" : "A node normally doesn't make automatic connections to peers in the functional tests because neither DNS seeds nor hardcoded peers are available on regtest. However, when random entries are inserted into addrman as part of a functional test (e.g. while testing addr relay), `ThreadOpenConnections` will periodically try to connect to them, resulting in log entries such as:\r\n`[opencon] [net.cpp:400] [ConnectNode] trying connection 18.166.1.1:8333 lastseen=0.0hrs`\r\n\r\nI don't think it's desirable that functional tests try to connect to random computers on the internet, aside from the possibility that at some point in time someone out there might actually answer in a way to ruin a test. This PR fixes this problem by adding the parameter `-connect=0` to selected tests.\r\n\r\nThis approach has the downside that one would have to remember to add `-connect=0`  when creating additional relevant tests in the future. However, the only reasonable alternative I could think of was activating `-connect=0` globally for the functional test framework - this seemed too restrictive, especially since I think it couldn't easily be changed back to normal in selected tests if we'd actually ever _want_ to test some logic in `ThreadOpenConnections`.",
