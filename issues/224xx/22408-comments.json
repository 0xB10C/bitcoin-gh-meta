If not we might wanna have some checks there too??\r\n\r\n- What's the purpose of `PrevoutNullInput` and other classes in `invalid_txs.py` in general? It seems they are not much used anywhere?\r\n\r\n- It seems here we are having a previously valid tx, and then appending an invalid input\r\nhttps://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/blob/1f449586a9e39bc4fb53cb5c7a31362e47aea19b/test/functional/mempool_accept.py#L252-L253\r\nWhich is same as \r\nhttps://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/blob/1f449586a9e39bc4fb53cb5c7a31362e47aea19b/test/functional/data/invalid_txs.py#L160-L161\r\nin  `PrevoutNullInput` `get_tx()` construction. \r\n\r\n  So maybe it can be used there instead of doing it via hand (adding a reason to have the class)? Or if its just that easy to append      an invalid input, does it make sense to have the class?  \r\n\r\n- As you are touching `invalid_txs.py`, maybe regarding https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22363#discussion_r663990893, it makes sense to apply same changes here too? \r\nhttps://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/blob/1f449586a9e39bc4fb53cb5c7a31362e47aea19b/test/functional/data/invalid_txs.py#L233\r\n\r\n  It probably makes more sense to change it in #22363 , just wanna note it, as I i missed it in that review.
