   "body" : "Make `CChainState::m_mempool` optional by making it a pointer instead of a reference. This will allow a simplification to assumeutxo semantics (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15606#pullrequestreview-692965905) and help facilitate the `-nomempool` option.\r\n\r\nNote that this creates some trouble with lock annotations; since `m_mempool->cs` now exists conditionally, I had to remove related annotations from some of the CChainState methods. Subsequently, this creates annotation warnings on the basis of CTxMempool's annotations. The simplest fix I could think of was isolating mempool-specific behavior in CChainState to methods annotated with NO_THREAD_SAFETY_ANALYSIS - this at least leaves non-mempool-related annotations in tact.",
