      "body" : "I think the reason is that in the failed run the txes sent to node1 via RPC and relayed to node0 are not accepted to the mempool of node 0 (\"bad-txns-premature-spend-of-coinbase\") because the sync between the two nodes is not finished by the time they are sent: https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5047271793360896?logs=ci#L2674\r\n\r\nWhile I think that this could be fixed just by adding a `sync_all()` after the `generate` (or by #20362), the root cause for the slow sync seems to be that something with  compact block relay went wrong (many \"Large reorg, won't direct fetch\" msgs in the log, and it reverts back to inv.) I don't know why that is happening here (unlike in my local runs), the cirrus log unfortunately only has the last 4k rows.",
