      "body" : "This is based on a confusion: `-externalip` does **not** set the bind address - neither for incoming nor outgoing addresses - what is does is change what address is advertised to other nodes. This is useful when the software cannot determine the outside connection address itself, e.g. to advertise an onion hidden service address.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to set the bind address for the listening port using `-bind`. Hardly any software allows choosing the bind address for outgoing connections, neither does bitcoind. There is a feature request for that open: #6476.\r\n",
