As mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/c65cc8cde30dd34a81962fda51a754f1cc0bdde8 the initial check caused issues with gitian builds, therefore this introduces a check for a `DONT_CHECK_FOR_DOT_GIT` environment variable to disable it if the variable is set to an arbitrary value. I'm not sure if this approach is suitable for gitian. Does gitian use something other then `.git` as GITDIR? Or what makes gitian builds special? Maybe @theuni can comment on that.\r\n\r\nAlso some minor lint fixups found by shellcheck.",
