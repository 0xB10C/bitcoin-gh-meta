      "body" : "Thanks for the testing. C++ is memory hungry, absolutely. I don't recommend building on 512MB at all. There was always a recommendation to use at least 1GB but it appears it got lost in f9298cc60e093533ce109aedd7d54d59e87865cd. It may be worded ackwardsly but the gcc tweaking is already *necessary* when compiling with *1 GB* of memory. 512MB is no-chance territory.\r\n\r\nAs I've mentioned repeatedly the best solution, which any embedded developer can tell you, against this frustration is to cross compile from say, an Ubuntu VM on a fast PC. For ARM:\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install g++-arm-linux-gnueabi # install toolchain\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\ncd depends\r\nmake -j10 HOST=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf NO_QT=1 # NO_WALLET=1 NO_UPNP=1 ...\r\ncd ..\r\n./configure --prefix=$PWD/depends/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf\r\nmake -j10\r\nscp src/bitcoind src/bitcoin-cli src/bitcoin-tx src/test/test_bitcoin $TARGET:\r\n```\r\nAnd voila, you have a `src/bitcoind` and `src/bitcoin-cli` etc to copy to the target.\r\n",
