      "body" : "I guess you'd need a BIP and universal support to do so.\r\n\r\nQuoting @sipa \r\n\r\n>  In my opinion, the correct way to do a hard fork is to first see if there is universal support for it, and when so, schedule it for 1 year in the future or so. No vote needed; everyone knows they have to upgrade by that time. There can still be a miner vote after that 1 year to be sure miners _also_ agree to the change, and know we'll end up with a secure chain after the fork, but that's just belt and suspenders.",
