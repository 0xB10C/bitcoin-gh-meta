No vote needed; everyone knows they have to upgrade by that time. There can still be a miner vote after that 1 year to be sure miners _also_ agree to the change, and know we'll end up with a secure chain after the fork, but that's just belt and suspenders.",

A change of PoW is something that would make most sense for the side of the hard-fork that forks off - as they're changing consensus behavior already.\r\n\r\nNo matter what, definitely needs a BIP and discussion on the mailing list. This would need a change to many other software: at least every miner and pool implementation, and thus is not an issue that can be handled here (though it's good to have an implementation ready).\r\n",
