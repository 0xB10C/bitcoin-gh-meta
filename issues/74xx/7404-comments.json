There has been no economic analysis to justify this.\r\n\r\nSegWit eliminates Bitcoin security by depriving nodes of the ability to validate signatures.\r\n\r\nThe Bitcoin community REJECTS the conversion of the Bitcoin network into a settlement network.\r\n\r\nThere is no consensus for this highly controversial change and it does not even pass the tests.",
