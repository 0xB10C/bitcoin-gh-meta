Not clear if Bitcoin was properly and completely closed before data files were manually moved.\r\n\r\nLocking fixes committed over the last year should have fixed the original result of running out of datadir space, which was to crash spectacularly.\r\n\r\nI think this is better resubmitted as an (improvement)(feature) request focusing on the specific area where improvement is thought to be needed. A really good bug report has a pull request, and if not, a specific code change request. I'll outline two feature requests that are compact enough in scope to be addressed:\r\n\r\n1. OS Installer: Include insufficient datadir disk space check/warning upon install.\r\n\r\n a. set minimum disk free space as educated guess for near future ~40gb (similar to checkpoints),\r\n b. in case of reinstall, subtract existing %datadir%/blocks/*.dat file sizes from warning calculation.\r\n c. write helpfile button for warning describing -datadir option to choose alternate data location.\r\n\r\n2. add installer wizard panel showing default datadir, with option to browse and select custom datadir (a non-default directory selection would be written to bitcoin.conf)\r\n\r\nI fear that disk space checking routines would be quite platform-dependent, needing a universal library to be included for this before one can think about what Bitcoin Core does with this information.",
