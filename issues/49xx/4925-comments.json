I think that the idea was that these lightweight nodes would send the input transactions and their Merkle branches along with any sent transactions to prove to other lightweight nodes that the transaction is OK, and then the recipient would download full Merkle trees for the next few blocks and save the appropriate branches.\r\n\r\nI guess that something like this isn't planned for Bitcoin Core anymore, but I suspect that the branches may still be useful for something in the future. They allow you to prove that a wallet transaction is in the main chain without making the recipient of the proof download anything but headers, which seems potentially useful. Maybe someone else knows of some specific use-cases. (Perhaps this doesn't justify keeping them now, since they could be added again later if they're actually needed.)",

It chanages paths in makefile.linux-mingw or otherwise changes build scripts in a way that made them incompatible with the automated testing scripts (please tweak those patches in qa/pull-tester)\n2. It adds/modifies tests which test network rules (thanks for doing that), which conflicts with a patch applied at test time\n3. It does not build on either Linux i386 or Win32 (via MinGW cross compile)\n4. The test suite fails on either Linux i386 or Win32\n5. The block test-cases failed (lookup the first bNN identifier which failed in https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts/blob/master/FullBlockTestGenerator.java)\n\nIf you believe this to be in error, please ping BlueMatt on freenode or TheBlueMatt here.\n\nThis test script verifies pulls every time they are updated. It, however, dies sometimes and fails to test properly.  If you are waiting on a test, please check timestamps to verify that the test.log is moving at http://jenkins.bluematt.me/pull-tester/current/\nContact BlueMatt on freenode if something looks broken.",
