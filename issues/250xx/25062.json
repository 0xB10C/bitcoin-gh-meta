This doesn't work very well, because there is no (central) way for a developer to search for the bounty, or keep track of them.\r\n\r\n@Bosch-0 brough up https://bitcoinbounties.org/ but I'm not sure if we want to rely on a third party site, that lists other projects.\r\n\r\nI thought maybe a new label for bounties could be a good idea.\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke wasn't sure this was a good solution, and brought up [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21071#issuecomment-1095005372) that we should discuss possible solutions in a separate issue.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?",
