      "body" : "Ah, thanks @jonatack ð. Just noticed that the GUI `WalletTests` isn't run by default in my OS under `make check`.\r\n\r\nIt's an easy fix; as the test doesn't start the balance polling timer, the model does not have the balance cached so.. as 5babfb7 make uses of it, the creation process fails with a not-enough balance error.\r\n\r\nWill push the fix and expand + improve the test coverage a bit more.\r\nAnd.. most likely will decouple that last commit into a separate PR in few days. Have some further improvements locally for the wallet model area that can package out all together that aren't really part of the scope of this PR.\r\n(like a mutex to be able to access the model cached balance from different threads, connect it to the widgets etc..)",
