Also the package should have dependencies on both `capnp` and `native_capnp`.\r\n\r\nThe second commit drops unneeded `native_libmultiprocess` package. It was earlier [commented](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24387#issuecomment-1054776195):\r\n> I don't understand why it currently has a dependency on `native_$(package)`. That may be causing it to work indirectly, but doesn't seem to make much sense.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe third commit is another optimization as it is obvious that both `native_capnp` and `capnp` packages are required when cross-compiling only.\r\n\r\nIt is not simple to just avoid `native_capnp` building, as variables in `capnp.mk` reference to variables from `native_capnp.mk`. This could be solved by code repetition, but it is ugly and error prone.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I've retrofitted `native_capnp.mk` for usage in non-cross builds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes bitcoin/bitcoin#24387.",
