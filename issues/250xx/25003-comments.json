So there is already an implicit way to see if the second `CreateTransactionInternal` call failed, and it could indeed be that the documentation is not clear enough. What made me sceptical about the conditional tracepoint call though is the fact that there is a \"succeeded\" parameter (where currently the result of the _first_ `CreateTransactionInternal` is passed, i.e. always \"true\").\r\n\r\nI'd conclude then that we can remove either\r\n- the `attempting_aps_create_tx` tracepoint (if this PR is preferred), or\r\n- the success parameter from the `aps_create_tx_internal ` tracepoint (with an according documentation update, e.g. \"is called when completed successfully\")",
