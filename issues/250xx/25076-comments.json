It'd also remove the ability to simply set `enable_werror`.\r\n\r\n> \"guix: fix glibc 2.27 multiple definition warnings with GCC 10\" is about warnings, why is it required after disabling -Werror in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/e138dead3f85fd85c791d6ec0fd41e69fa69d775?\r\n\r\nIt's to fix a link issue (`-fcommon`). Turning compiler warnings into errors, or not, is unrelated.\r\n\r\n> Considering this, maybe limit this patch to the powerpc hosts only?\r\n\r\nI don't really want to start configuring / compiling HOST glibcs differently (RISCV is already an exception).",
