Even if the `prune=0` setting from `bitcoin.conf` take precedences over the GUI pruning setting, the pruning checkbox is still checked by default and that is misleading. I think Ideally when the \"Use a custom data directory\" option is changed, the `bitcoin.conf` file from that path would be reloaded and the settings shown will actually reflect the settings that will be applied. #15936 addresses this issue somewhat, because it at least ensures that the setting displayed will be the setting applied. But it doesn't take the additional step of loading the `bitcoin.conf` and displaying the disabled value.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/25052#issue-1222628734\r\n\r\n> I don't want to prune and have therefore set prune=0 in bitcoin.conf. But that won't stop 23.0 from pruning. Have to manually un-tick the tick box at startup.\r\n\r\nJust to reinforce what hebasto wrote, setting prune=0 in bitcoin.conf _will_ stop 23.0 from pruning, and you do not have to un-tick the box. The box is just overridden and ignored so ticking or unticking it has no effect.\r\n",
