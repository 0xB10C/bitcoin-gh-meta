      "body" : "I retested this using 24.0rc5, and I also set up a second bitcoind instance just for testing my hidden service. Similar setup, but I use\r\n\r\n```\r\n-connect=xxx.onion:8333\r\n```\r\n\r\nto specifically only connect to my hidden server (address redacted). However, all I get in the log of the connecting bitcoind is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSocks5() connect to xxx.onion:8333 failed: general failure\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that if I configure a hidden service manually (in the tor container), I can connect. So my test setup seems to be fine.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if I could somehow see in the logs what bitcoind tells tor via the control port. For example, does it perhaps tell to connect to localhost rather than bitcoind? Does such a tracelog exist?",
