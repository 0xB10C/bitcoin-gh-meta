      "body" : "Thanks for picking this up @hebasto. I spend a day looking into this issue https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24387#issuecomment-1054776195 but got too confused by what I was seeing.\r\n\r\nTaking a quick look at this, first commit passing executable paths to libmultiprocess makes sense. Second commit dropping native_libmultiprocess at first thought does not seem to make sense. Third commit optimizing native builds seems ok, but perhaps not worth added complexity.\r\n\r\nFor the second commit, I wouldn't think you could drop the native_libmultiprocess package. The libmultiprocess & capnp packages are both fat packages producing multiple outputs which are sometimes unnecessary. A less wasteful capnp packaging would be divided in two parts, with one package to build command-line tools [`capnp`, etc](https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/capnproto/filelist) which only need to be natively compiled, and separate package to build  libraries [`libcapnp.a`, etc](https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/libcapnp-dev/filelist) which need to be cross and native. Similarly a less wasteful libmultiprocess packaging would define one package to build the [`mpgen`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/49dc279926fe852fc75b3da7582f146f0b805642/CMakeLists.txt#L76) codegen tool, which only needs to be built natively, and another package to build the [`libmultiprocess.a`](https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/blob/49dc279926fe852fc75b3da7582f146f0b805642/CMakeLists.txt#L55) library. When I wrote these packages, I wrote them as fat packages building codegen executables and runtime libraries together, instead smaller packages building them separately, just for simplicity to avoid repeating the similar build definitions. I also didn't try to trim unnecessary outputs because they didn't seem very expensive to build.\r\n\r\nSo I don't understand how the second commit dropping `native_libmultiprocess` could work, given that bitcoin build needs it to provide a native `mpgen` codegen executable. The comment \"I don't understand why it currently has a dependency\" was just trying to say that `libmultiprocess` package should not depend on `native_libmultiprocess` package, not that `native_libmultiprocess` should not exist at all.\r\n\r\n**Questions / Recommendations** for this PR\r\n\r\n- I wonder if first commit is sufficient to fix problems, and maybe second and third commits are unnecessary? I think I would drop them and maybe make them into separate followups if they provide advantages.\r\n\r\n- This is more of a long term question, and maybe an ignorant one since I'm not familiar with the Guix build, but why do even need the depends system anymore? I'd expect the Guix build to define guix packages instead of using depends packages. I don't personally don't use depends since I use Nix and write a `shell.nix` to bring in developer dependencies.  I'd expect other developers to use their own preferred package managers. Do people actually use the depends system, or is there a thought of dropping it and just switching to guix packages for QA and releases and standard packages for developing?",
