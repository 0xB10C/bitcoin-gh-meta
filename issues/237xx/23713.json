   "body" : "Previously, the `addrman_tried_collisions` behaved in the following way:\r\n\r\n1. add an address to addrman\r\n2. attempt to move the new address to the tried table (using `AddrMan.Good()`)\r\n3. verify that `num_addrs` matched `size()` to check for collisions in the new table\r\n\r\nThis caused 3 collisions in the tried table (which caused the entries to stay in the new table) until eventually there was a collision in the new table. The test verified that there was a collision in the new table and passed.\r\n\r\nWhile the collision in the new table was caused by a collision in the tried table, the test is misleading as it's not directly testing for collisions in the tried table and misses 3 collisions before identifying a collision in the new table.\r\n\r\n### solution\r\n\r\nTo more directly test the tried table, I exposed `nTried` as the public method `tried()`. This gives the number of entries in the tried table. Now the test adds to new, moves to tried, and verifies `tried()` matches `size()`. Once a collision occurs, the test verifies that `size()` == `tried() + collision`, meaning the address was not moved from new to tried",
