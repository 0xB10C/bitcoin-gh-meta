   "body" : "Fixes #22449 by increasing the mocktime jump (just as in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/6168eb06b2044f00f18727b955b672fc91c60bd7), which prevents failures due to rare Poisson timer events, or at least makes them a lot more unlikely.\r\n\r\nThe second commit combines the addr generation helper functions `setup_addr_msg` and `setup_rand_addr_msg`. It also changes the way `addr.time` is filled to random, because before, if too many addresses (>600) were created in a batch, they would stop being relayed because their timestamp would be too far in the future.
