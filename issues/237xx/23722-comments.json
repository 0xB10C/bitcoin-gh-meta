After #22854 is solved by pulling in the newer subtree, is there another issue that would be fixed by this change? It's working around that fact that autotools thinks it's not cross-compiling because the system is configured to run .exe bins without explicitly calling wine. However if the only consequence is a single incorrect line printed in the configure output, that's not a huge issue.\r\n\r\nIf anything, a better/more generic solution might be to set `build_alias`, as when build differs from host configure is meant to automatically enter cross-compilation mode.",
