I've included your suggested phrases and also re-ordered the array, according to the order they appear on the logs (I didn't notice that they were following this order).\r\nI've changed the command `self.log.debug ` to `self.log.info` for checking the lines. \r\nDo you suggest me to also include this change on the PR? or should I leave it back to `self.log.debug`?
