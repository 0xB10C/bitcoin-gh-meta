Porting `BaseIndex::ThreadSync` and other index code to sync with `interfaces::Chain` instead of calling validation code directly. The motivation is to let indexes be used with [#10102](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10102) and run in different processes, but this also adds a new chain sync feature that can be used by wallets.\r\n2. Introducing a block reader class to help with parallel rescans and pass same block data to multiple indexes.\r\n3. Going to rebase [#15719](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15719) on top of this rescan code so wallets can use the same chain sync interface as the indexes\r\n\r\nThere's some uncertainty and performance tradeoffs in step 2. Right now my block reader implementation just reads 2 blocks at a time so previous block can be processed while next block is read. But it might be better to let indexes and wallets read blocks more freely without trying to schedule things.",
