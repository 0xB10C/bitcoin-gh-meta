(https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Change_address_detection)\r\nFor the mentioned special scenario \"p2sh-witness as address type and there are no bech32(m) outputs.\" and a simple spend to a P2SH(-wrapped) destination:\r\n- On master, the change address is also P2SH(-wrapped) -> Perfect, both outputs are equally likely to be change.\r\n- On the PR branch, the change address is bech32(m). Is this slightly worse? (Or even better, as analyzers assume the change address type usually matches the input type and would wrongly deduce that the bech32(m) output is actually the destination?)\r\n\r\nJust thinking out loud, would be very interested to hear comments about this.",
