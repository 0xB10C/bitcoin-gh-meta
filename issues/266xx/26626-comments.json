I had a discussion with @sipa about that and we concluded that it wasn't useful at least for the purpose that this PR targets.\r\n\r\nMultipath descriptors expands into multiple descriptors. In #22838, this is implemented as `Parse` returning multiple `Descriptor` objects. However in this PR, `{KEY,KEY,KEY...}` is interpreted as a single ranged `PubkeyProvider` like we do for xpubs. Doing it this way allows us to get the intended performance benefit for migrated non-HD wallets as interpreting it like multipath descriptors would just result in the same issue of having thousands of descriptors.",
