I had a discussion with @sipa about that and we concluded that it wasn't useful at least for the purpose that this PR targets.\r\n\r\nMultipath descriptors expands into multiple descriptors. In #22838, this is implemented as `Parse` returning multiple `Descriptor` objects. However in this PR, `{KEY,KEY,KEY...}` is interpreted as a single ranged `PubkeyProvider` like we do for xpubs. Doing it this way allows us to get the intended performance benefit for migrated non-HD wallets as interpreting it like multipath descriptors would just result in the same issue of having thousands of descriptors.",

There is no requirement that everyone implements all of them, as long as supported keywords have the same meaning across implementations. For example, new software might not care about pre-segwit `pk`/`pkh`/`sh`; that would mean implementing BIP380 (base language) and BIP382 (`wpkh`/`wsh`), but not BIP381 (`pk`/`pkh`/`sh`). But if they don't implement those, they can't give a different meaning to the same keywords.\r\n\r\nThings like BIP384 (`combo`) and BIP385 (`addr`/`raw`) are probably already fairly Bitcoin Core specific.",
