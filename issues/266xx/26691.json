   "body" : "Now that libsecp256k1 has a release (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-December/021271.html), update the subtree to match it.\r\n\r\nThe changes themselves are not very impactful for Bitcoin Core, but include:\r\n* It's no longer needed to specify whether contexts are for signing or verification or both (all contexts support everything), so make use of that in this PR. This also means that the key.cpp and pubkey.cpp secp256k1 contexts could be merged into one, but there is no immediate benefit to that.\r\n* Most modules are now enabled by default, so we can drop explicit enabling for them.\r\n* CI improvements (in particular, MSVC and more recent MacOS)\r\n* Introduction of an internal int128 type, which has no effect for GCC/Clang builds, but enables 128-bit multiplication in MSVC, giving a ~20% speedup there (but still slower than GCC/Clang).\r\n* Release process changes (process documentation, changelog, ...).\r\n",
