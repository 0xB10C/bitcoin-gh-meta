      "body" : "> Changing that by throwing could affect downstream users that are expecting unloadwallet to just wait.\r\n\r\nDo you know any software that would use this behavior? I understand this could affect users but this seems a bit hacky.\r\n\r\n> A warning could be given when a rescan has been aborted by unloadwallet so that a user is not surprised.\r\n\r\nI don't really have an opinion on this. But an argument for keeping the warning in 8198c76a3008094fefbbae1b11e5d5673a993158 is that an user may not realize that the wallet is still rescanning and wouldn't want to abort it when trying to unload.\r\nAs a compromise we could add a 'force' argument to unloadwallet to abort the rescan if there is one.",
