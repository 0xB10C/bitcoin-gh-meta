   "body" : "Inspired by @MarcoFalke's [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26506#discussion_r1036149426). Based on #26506 - draft until that's merged and I have some Concept / Approach ACKs on this (even though it's a small change - and can also rebase if #26506 doesn't get merged). The last 3 commits are non-base:\r\n\r\n- 1437b0059 test: add cases to JSON parsing\r\n- b143564df refactor: reduce unnecessary complexity in ParseNonRFCJSONValue\r\n- d53953f99 refactor: use string_view for values\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMain purpose of this PR is to minimize copying (potentially large) RPC named arguments when calling `.substr()` by using `std::string_view` instead of `std::string`. Furthermore, cleans up the code by removing unnecessary complexity in `ParseNonRFCJSONValue()` (done first to avoid refactoring required to concatenate `string` and `string_view`), updates some naming and adds a few test cases. Should not introduce any behaviour change.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n- Was there actually any merit to `ParseNonRFCJSONValue()` surrounding the value with brackets and then parsing it as an array? I don't see it, and the new approach doesn't fail any tests. Still a bit suspicious about it though.",
