But I cannot see the address it was taken from. I understand why this is (because the idea behind the wallet is that you have a single balance), but it makes the history-tab almost useless for me now. I merged many wallets into a single big one, giving every address a label based on the wallet-name it originally belonged to. I can track the history of incoming transactions just fine that way, and showing the inputs in the details dialogue would make that possible for the outgoing ones too.",
