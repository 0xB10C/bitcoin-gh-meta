      "body" : "Can we exchange a few more thoughts on this Please? Take another look at ``ipcSendCommandLine()``.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have 2 checks for normal URIs that can fail ``GUIUtil::parseBitcoinURI()`` and ``CBitcoinAddress::IsValid()``. Both of which are used _just_ to detect the active network (for sending the received URI to the TCP local sever), we currently don't use them to reject invalid URIs or show any message.\r\n\r\nNow add my change, which just first tries to send to the mainnet TCP local server and if that fails tries testnet TCP local server and if that fails client associated with bitcoin: is started (which, as I said is not recommended).\r\n\r\nIMHO it's ugly and unneeded to use static QMessageBox calls to show messages to the user in ``ipcSendCommandLine()``, if we would just say try mainnet first and testnet otherwise and remove the pre-checks (which are done later in the client again, if we parse the URIs for real usage) this would reduce code complexity and allows us to handle all URI or payment-request related checks later when client is fully initialized.",

We shouldn't be spending this much time on it. The only thing that matters here security, and clear feedback that something is wrong. A simple QMessageBox does as well as anything here.\r\n\r\nThe pre-check here would try to figure out whether the URI/payment request is testnet or mainnet, *only* if it cannot figure out it should error out prematurely. It does not need to do further checking on the URI, as that can happen later on.\r\nIt's not really a problem if some input checking happens in two places. Better be safe than sorry.\r\n",
