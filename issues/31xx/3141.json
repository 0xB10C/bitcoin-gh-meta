But when using very large wallets, this will freeze the interface so much that it becomes impossible to finish typing. Adding a very small delay would solve this issue, since it would allow me to finish my input before the client freezes.\r\n\r\nFor example, when I try to look up transactions greater than 999 BTC, it will first start searching for all transactions > 9 BTC, and then > 99 BTC, and finally 999 BTC, even though I'm typing 999 as fast as I possibly can.",
