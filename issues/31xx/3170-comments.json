      "body" : "> Maybe the regular reorgs on signet now cover this? @0xB10C?\r\n\r\nI don't think so. The idea was to keep the automatic reorgs smallish (somewhere between 1 to 12 blocks) for now. Also, I don't think SigNet is the right place to test this. I'm not sure what the _OP_RETURN disconnection failure bug_ was, but I don't think there are enough transactions on SigNet to catch something like this.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think a script that `invalidateblock` blocks one by one starting from the tip while recording `hash(dumptxoutset)` or `gettxoutsetinfo` with coinstatsindex enabled - and then, once close to genesis, `reconsiderblock` for each block and compares the hash of the UTXO set, should be doable. I'm not sure if that's what was meant in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2839#issuecomment-21302247 with _a table with the proper utxo state for every height_.",
