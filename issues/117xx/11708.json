   "body" : "Currently `signrawtransaction` works with P2SH-P2WSH which are already in wallet (e.g. `addmultisigaddress` -> `addwitnessaddress`). But when using signrawtransaction with keys which aren't in the wallet, there is currently only a `redeemScript` key so you cannot enter both the P2SH redeemScript and the witness script. There is an undocumented workaround by including the same input twice (suggested on StackExchange [here](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/62746/51948)), once with each script, but that is unnecessary and hacky. \r\n\r\nThis simply allows the optional inclusion of a witnessScript key in the JSON input to `signrawtransaction`. Because it uses JSON, this is a non-breaking change.\r\n\r\nAlso, as discussed on IRC ([see here](https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/2017-11-16/?msg=93580994&page=1)), we add a `witnessScript` output to the listunspent RPC for P2SH-P2WSH addresses because gmaxwell pointed out signrawtransaction should be able to get most of the needed info from listunspent.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11693 \r\n\r\nTODO: \r\n- ~Needs tests + release notes~",
