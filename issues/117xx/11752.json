I had no swap partition active.\r\n\r\nThe process runs under runit; when it aborts it gets automatically restarted.\r\n\r\nNow bitcoind starts re-syncing from the beginning, instead of starting from where it left off.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM:\r\nThat creates a lot of unnecessary traffic (many GB) and unnecessary time delay (many hours).\r\n\r\nEXPECTED:\r\nAfter an error (in this case out of memory), bitcoind should start from where it left of without wasting time and IP bandwidth.\r\n\r\nAfter I realized this, I added swap space, but still, everything has to be resynced over the network.\r\n\r\nbitcoin 0.15\r\nOS: void linux\r\nRAM: 1GB\r\nCPU: via-c7-D i686\r\n\r\n",
