Cryptographic code like this is incredibly stable, so the usual reasons for doing refactoring like this (easier maintenance) don't really apply - it's likely possible to not ever touch it.\r\n\r\nHowever, as such all the changes here look fine to me. Not sure the `auto` variables are necessary, but moving to a more C++ish style doesn't sound back.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK",
