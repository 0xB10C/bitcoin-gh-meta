The redeemscript only contains a hash of the witness script in the case of P2SH-P2WSH, which is not sufficient to sign with.\n\nIt would be possible to require passing only the witness script, and automatically also add the v0 P2WSH redeemscript (and any future versions?). But just the redeemscript is not enough.",
