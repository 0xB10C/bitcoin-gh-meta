Since at startup, we default to 450, we could change the minimum value of the spin-box to the cli value. This however, would prevent the user from reducing the db cache size from the cli value. What do you suggest?",

Because right below there's `Open Configuration File` and the instructions (how to override) are above that button which makes it easy to both see the current setting and know how to change it without reading documentation. The only thing that's missing (see other parts of the GUI) would be advice that a restart is required for the new setting to to take effect. (In case dbcache isn't set in bitcoin.conf, I assume the default value would be displayed).",
