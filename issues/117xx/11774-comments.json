This PR will just be the actual renaming, so is easy to automatically regenerate, and should be easy to review once the previous PR is merged. Have also split the renaming into multiple commits by test area, which I think makes it a bit easier to review, but happy to revert that if not.\r\n\r\nMarking as WIP until #11796 is actually merged, since I'm expecting this to require a bunch of rebases.",
