Differences are:\r\n  - `OUTPUT_SIZE` of the hash\r\n  - magic number constants which can be derived from `OUTPUT_SIZE`\r\n- Code duplication is error prone and causes maintenance issues.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Eliminate magic numbers by making `OUTPUT_SIZE` a compile-time\r\n  constant and deriving the other constants from it.\r\n- Compile-time constants permit container type creation, type-based\r\n  bounds checking, and range-based iteration instead of run-time\r\n  branching.\r\n- Elimination of run-time eval and magic numbers allows templatization\r\n  to reduce code duplication.\r\n- Old type names and header files are preserved via `using`\r\n  declarations to limit the scope of the change.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- This is a rethink which takes into account the comments from #11735 ",
