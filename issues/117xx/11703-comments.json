So all transactions which are recognized during a rescan  (due to wallet change or import of a priv key) will not get their real timestamp if they are older than the latest transaction sent by the core client. However, if you have not (yet) send or received any transaction with the running core client so far, private keys are imported correctly. Also exchanging wallet.dat woked without noticable problems.  The problem starts with the first transaction send. I hope this observation helps fixing it.",

But I'm sure there is some way we can keep that ordering but preserve the time of a transaction.",
