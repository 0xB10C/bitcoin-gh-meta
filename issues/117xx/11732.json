This would allow using more C++11 features such as thread local data (https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/cxx0x_status.html versus https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/cxx0x_status.html). FWIW gcc 4.7.0 was released in March 22, 2012, last bugfix release was 4.7.4 in June 12, 2014.\r\n\r\n> Also FWIW I tried to build bitcoin on g++ 4.7 a while ago and it was a pain; for example the AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX fails because the __cplusplus macro is not set correctly, and that's only the beginning. As it's already effectively broken and no one else seems to even notice it, I wouldn't mind bumping the requirement to g++ 4.8 wholesale. But I'm not sure that discussion belongs here.\r\n\r\nIs anyone successfully building on g++ 4.7?\r\n\r\n@theuni what's your opinion?\r\n",
