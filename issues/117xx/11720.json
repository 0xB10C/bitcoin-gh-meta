   "body" : "The iPhone 8 and X come with 256 GB variants. Plenty to store the current blockchain, certainly enough when you prune it. Most people who can afford such a phone also have pretty liberal data plans. This means there's at least some demographic out there that can practically run a full node on their phone.\r\n\r\nIDB and syncing more than a day still need wifi (can be done in the background when the phone is charging). Connections to other nodes would need some throttling on mobile. Maybe a smart app could even use SPV or trust a server when it's not fully synced.\r\n\r\nI wonder how hard it would be to create an iOs target (for bitcoind) based on the OSX target.\r\n\r\nBuilding a full fledged iOs app is out of scope here, so it would just be the RPC client. Leaving out QT should also make that a lot easier.\r\n\r\n",
