For example, the mempool/feeestimator may now be significantly ahead of what the wallet has processed. So calling CreateTransaction when we're in the middle of connecting 10 blocks seems... dangerous, even with the BlockUntilSyncedToCurrentChain hack.\r\n",

If anything the fee estimator should be at much lower risk there than for wallet...at worst you'll get out of date fee estimates...something you'd get anyway because you're calling the fee estimator in the middle of syncing stuff. Note that #11824 also keeps the queue depth at no more than 10, though I dont really want to rely on that and would prefer to implement the dump/reload-from-disk proposal suggested at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11775/files#diff-e8d9e22d9683f73a9fb8399be0dab640R145",
