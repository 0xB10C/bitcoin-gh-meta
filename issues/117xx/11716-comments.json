It was mainly there because it's easier to implement than downgrading a future SegWit (or otherwise strongly refactored) wallet format.\r\n\r\nThe idea came from this discussion between you and @sipa in the above linked [Gist](https://gist.github.com/sipa/125cfa1615946d0c3f3eec2ad7f250a2#gistcomment-2261804):\r\n\r\n>>  It seems much easier to just automatically upgrade, and provide a recovery tool in case you need to force your wallet to work with an old version.\r\n\r\n> Hmm, a recovery tool is another option, I suppose. I guess I would be perfectly fine with that option instead as well, but certainly one is required IMO.\r\n\r\nFrom this I gather that if you implemented auto-upgrade, then there should be a way to downgrade.

The upgrade paths are already non-trivial to reason about, not to mention that most of them are untested (only implicitly tested on real developers' testnet/mainet wallets).\r\n\r\nI don't think we can support a wallet downgrade tool (regardless of the interface) in rpc, command line or separate tool. Instead, I'd suggest that the proposed way of downgrading a wallet is by not upgrading. That means to create regular backups of the wallet and only upgrade after backing up the wallet.\r\n\r\nIn case we add auto-upgrade, there should be an option to disable auto-update (advertised in the release notes and command line option help).",
