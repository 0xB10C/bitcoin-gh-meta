More info here: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/\r\n\r\n#### C++11 Support\r\nStatus of C++11 support in GCC 4.8: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/cxx0x_status.html.\r\nGCC 4.8.1 was the first feature-complete implementation of the 2011 C++ standard, previously known as C++0x.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can find the last time we committed a fix specifically for GCC 4.7 was in #1126.\r\nThe last fix committed specifically for GCC 4.8 was in #3895. \r\nThere have been various \"fixes\" for wShadow warnings etc tested against GCC 4.8.x versions since then.\r\n\r\nOne of the downsides listed for \"Consider building with -flto\" in #10616 is  \"Before GCC 4.8: double size object files\". A bump to GCC 4.8 would remove that issue.",
