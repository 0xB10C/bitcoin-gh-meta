      "body" : "@jonasschnelli thanks, I'll try that.\r\n\r\n@3ullShark App Store rules come and go and can even be lobbied for (although this one has been around for a long time). Syncing in the foreground is a pretty bad user experience. Despite that rule, it does seem like a use case as described [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html).\r\n\r\nThere might be two workarounds:\r\n\r\n1. tell users to build from source and install using Xcode (this is safer too, obviously not n00b friendly, but I'd use that)\r\n2. leverage [Cloudkit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit) \r\n\r\nFor (2), the blockchain would be stored in Cloudkit, e.g. one block per [CKAsset](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckasset). The app would subscribe to these blocks, receives push notifications and downloads each block in the background (which you can make conditional on wifi, etc). Most of that is handled at the OS level, meaning the app just need to wake up to handle each push notification.  Processing can be done after each download or when the app is in the foreground.\r\n\r\nSee also this [explainer)(https://medium.com/@guilhermerambo/synchronizing-data-with-cloudkit-94c6246a3fda).  It might still run afoul of that App Store rule; I'm not sure how to interpret it.  It also requires significantly more complex interaction with bitcoind than the RPC currently allows. And using the P2P network when in the foreground vs. using Apple's servers when in the background might have all sorts of security trade-offs.\r\n\r\nAll that is for iOs app developers to worry about though; we can just make the compiler work.",

Not sure if that's still the case though.\r\n\r\n",
