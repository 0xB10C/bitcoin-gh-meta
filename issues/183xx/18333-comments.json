You are advised to\r\n    start relying on the new Automake support for AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS\r\n    instead (which was introduced in Automake 1.13).\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that we're already using `AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR{,S}` here\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ef8cdb0e6cb2c019a2e4a05aa15cc463a10477d7/configure.ac#L15",
