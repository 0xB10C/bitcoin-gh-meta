I'm a beginner so was just looking to address comments I see, but definitely seems a good idea to see if  the other tests in the file can be improved in the same way. \r\n\r\nAlso noticed in `p2p_segwit.py`, most of the tests don't have error messages at all.

      "body" : "Thanks for these test improvements! The code looks good to me, but I have some stylistic suggestions- \r\n* The PR description gets added to the merge commit (you can check out [recent commits](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/master)).. so I'd recommend keeping it focused on describing the high level functionality of the PR. \r\n* Specific commit-level explanations can be on the commit messages themselves. Leaving the hashes out of the description also has the benefit of not needing to update every time you force push. I suspect your current commit messages are the product of some commits being squashed together, so I'd recommend revisiting to make them have a one-line description, followed by any additional description you think is helpful. here's an example of the rough format I like to use: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18038/commits/e82fdd329c812623c6e8a9022322fe43e1000c5b",
