      "body" : "Hi @billygarrison ,\r\n\r\nI just cloned, configured and compiled successfully a Windows Bitcoin-Qt binary. \r\n\r\nMy setup is:\r\n\r\n* Windows 10 Pro, 1909,  Build 18363.719\r\n* WSL with **Linux 4.4.0-18362-Microsoft #476-Microsoft Fri Nov 01 16:53:00 PST 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux**\r\n* Intel CPU i7\r\n* Fresh Bitcoin clone\r\n\r\nBefore having started building the binaries I executed the usual\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsudo apt update\r\nsudo apt upgrade -y\r\n```\r\nto update my Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nI did neither encounter problems with *make* in *depends*-directory nor later when building Bitcoin itself.\r\n\r\nHere the About window of my local build:\r\n\r\n![build_bitcoin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brakmic/bazaar/master/images/random/bitcoin_build.png)\r\n\r\nNow I have one \"stupid\" question: **did you also set the compiler for Ubuntu 18.04** as stated [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md#building-for-64-bit-windows)?:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ # Set the default mingw32 g++ compiler option to posix.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI actually assume you did, because you wrote you were following the Bitcoin Windows Compilation docs.\r\n\r\nRegards,",

The only thing I can think that has changed on my end is I built it in `/src/bitcoin/depends` this time instead of `/home/billy/bitcoin/depends`. I had to use `sudo make`, which could be why it worked without error.\r\n\r\nI will try building the depends in `/home/billy/bitcoin/depends` again, with and without `sudo`, to see if the error occurs.",
