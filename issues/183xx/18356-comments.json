It's where the setting set in the GUI are saved. Instead you should be using a bitcoin.conf file in your datadir. Command line arguments and bitcoin.conf options will override any of the settings set from within the GUI (aka all the things in bitcoin-qt.conf).\r\n\r\nbitcoin-qt checks for the existence of the datadir. So just make sure the datadir exists and the welcome dialog won't appear.",
