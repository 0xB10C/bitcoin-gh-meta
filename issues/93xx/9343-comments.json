      "body" : "The main motivation behind this feature was to be able to send the whole\nbalance without having to guess or bisect. Will that be broken by this\nchange?\n\nOn Dec 13, 2016 10:49 PM, \"Alex Morcos\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n@cozz <https://github.com/cozz>\n@gmaxwell <https://github.com/gmaxwell>\n@laanwj <https://github.com/laanwj>\n\nThis might be controversial since it directly reverts behavior that was\nexplicitly included in #4331 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4331>\n(merged as #5831 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5831>)\n\nThat PR took the approach that if subtractFeeFromAmount was selected then\nit would be unexpected for the user to ever spend more bitcoins than the\namount they requested to pay. Therefore if any change was under the dust\nlimit, instead of sending it to fee, it was increase to the dust limit.\n\nI believe this is misguided. Creating a change output at the dust limit is\nlikely uneconomical. There is a difference between having to draw a\nthreshold below which all outputs are useless, and inverting that to say\nthat an output just above that limit is useful. Giving yourself change at\nthe dust limit is no better (and maybe even worse) than not giving yourself\nchange in the first place, so I don't believe it will adversely affect\nanyone who was not expecting to spend more coins than the pay amount.\n\nThe primary reason for this change is to make our wallet smarter about not\ncreating uselessly small outputs. To increase the change to the point where\nit was sufficiently big to be useful would require potentially removing too\nmuch from the recipients.\n------------------------------\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\n\n  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9343\nCommit Summary\n\n   - Don't create change at the dust limit, even if it means paying more\n   than expected\n\nFile Changes\n\n   - *M* src/qt/coincontroldialog.cpp\n   <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9343/files#diff-0> (11)\n   - *M* src/wallet/wallet.cpp\n   <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9343/files#diff-1> (22)\n\nPatch Links:\n\n   - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9343.patch\n   - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9343.diff\n\nÃ¢ÂÂ\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9343>, or mute the thread\n<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAHutpUBzzCt9dsFy8OiAJ6wyUmcsADyks5rHxLzgaJpZM4LMRLN>\n.\n",
