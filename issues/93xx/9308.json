   "body" : "Add more comprehensive unit tests for CCoinsViewCache. Right now it is hard to refactor caching code or fix bugs in the caching logic because you have to try to mentally enumerate all the different states the cache might be in to make sure a change doesn't cause unintended consequences. The new tests explicitly enumerate relevant cache states, documenting and verifying the behavior in each state, so it will be safer and easier to make changes to the caching code in the future.",
