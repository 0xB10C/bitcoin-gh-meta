      "body" : "Note that, while the code is written to support the entire linearization process, the primary purpose is to help support other libraries. For example, python-bitcoinlib's *getblock* call requires a little endian hash; the library converts to BE internally. Being able to write a hash list with linearize-hashes.py is, IMO, a nice feature. I know one could just convert the hashes separate from linearize-hashes. That would slow down other programs/scripts, though, even if only just a little bit.",
