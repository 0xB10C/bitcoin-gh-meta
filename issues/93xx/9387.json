The intention here is to later swap `httpserver` and others to use the `Event*` classes and to stop using the owned style `struct ev*` entirely.\r\n\r\nApproach:\r\n1. Scope out owned types and provide C++ methods as appropriate.\r\n2. Minimalize change by keeping non-owned types as is and adding no non-preexistent functionality.\r\n",
