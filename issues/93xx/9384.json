The other commits come from #9107, #9308, and #9310, which this is based on.\r\n\r\nThis change moves code responsible for updating the cache out of various CCoinsViewCache methods and into the CCoinsModifier class. This way the cache update code is just written once in a general way instead of being duplicated and split up to handle various special cases.\r\n\r\nThis is a refactoring, with changes to cache behavior only in 3 corner cases which don't affect the meaning of data stored in the cache (see coins_test.cpp for the 3 cases).",
