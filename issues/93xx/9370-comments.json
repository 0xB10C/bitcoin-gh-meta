That is a generally good thing to do-- and its important for HD key rescan (in fact, It should remove all keys up to the key it found).\r\n\r\nBut I don't believe that it is a correct solution here. We should reserve the key on use, having an argument (default to true) to do so would be okay but I'm not sure if it would be very useful.  Otherwise this is going to cause continual reuse with in flight transactions. ",
