IMO this should be external to the 'pong message' commit.\r\n\r\nand under the principle of making code self-documenting...\r\n\r\n2) use a named constant rather than a magic number for version behavior switching. bitcoin code is too full of magic numbers, and we should resist adding more.\r\n3) place that constant in sipa's newly minted version.h, as a central location for future version-related constants like this.",

      "body" : "To me, mixing the client version (metadata about the project you're compiling) and the network version (a property of the protocol being implemented) in the same module is wrong. It's like having a source file in firefox that encdes both information about the firefox browser version and the differences between HTML4 and HTML5.\r\n\r\nThe fact that both are called version and have a similar number scheme is an historic artifact, and I would prefer to get them separated rather sooner than later. Maybe remove the moniker '_VERSION' from all protocol-related code, and simply call it \"protocol 60000\". I agree that we need nice constants for magic protocol switches, but they do not belong in version.h. Really.",
