This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with vulnerable objects. This includes functions that call alloca, and functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes. The guards are initialized when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits. If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.\n\n-fstack-protector-all\nLike -fstack-protector except that all functions are protected.\n</pre>",
