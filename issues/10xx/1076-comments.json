What is possible, is adding this to PRE_TARGETDEPS, which makes sure it is rebuild right at the start of the build process. That should suffice, but there is a caveat: if your source directory contains a build.h as well, that one will be used. Perhaps we need a build/ directory as well in the non-Qt builds?\r\n\r\nEDIT: see my buildinfo branch",
