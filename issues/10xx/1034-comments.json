The payee wallet upon seeing both, could alert the user accordingly without the other uninvolved nodes needing to do anything above and beyond what they do upon seeing any valid transaction. As I understand it, nodes currently do not forward on double spends, and I think this is harmful as it takes away the payees ability to detect it, yet a miner could still include it in a block, and the payee would only find out at that point.\r\n\r\nI think the suggestion to flag it as red is a good one, and the -1 idea until 6 reached seems reasonable at first glance.\r\n\r\nBy the way, isn't this issue pretty much the same as currently open Issue #71?",
