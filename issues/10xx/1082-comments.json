From the 30 peers I could connect to, 14 are up to date. The other 16 peers are stuck at height 47475 and have a version < 50300.  This gives 0.47% of nodes that are updated. There is a fork is at height 46722 until 47475 (753 block long)\r\n\r\nThe options I see for the fix:\r\n    - code fix only: a huge second fork at height 46739, need to redownload the blockchain for all clients.\r\n    - code fix + special case for blocks [46739-54673]: would create a second fork at height 54673,.\r\n    - code fix + testnet reset: i'm not sure how many clients will update. 53% probably won't, and some of the 47% in version>50300 probably won't. \r\n\r\nAre there any other reasons for a testnet reset? If not, I'm not sure it's the best option as I don't like to remove all these test case transactions. The fork of 500+ nodes is also a good test scenario. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
