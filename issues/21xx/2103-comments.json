The underlying (psychological) issue is that the progress bar makes the sync look like a normal linear download of a fixed-size file in the mind of users. Adding a percentage adds to this illusion.\r\n\r\nEven though in reality it fetches a growing tree structure of uncertain (at least to any one observer) size, of which only the longest path is significant.\r\n\r\nSo there is a cognitive gap, and I would applaud efforts to visualize the progress in an intuitive way that doesn't cause this inherent confusion. However this is likely much more complex than can be solved by hair splitting over whether to show a percentage or not, or where to start counting.\r\n\r\nQuite possibly effort is better spent solving the underlying issue that frustrates users: having to wait at all! For example, developers are working on making the client start in SPV mode, so it is immediately usable, then fetching the block chain in the background.\r\n",

IMHO, it just shows that a progress bar is not the correct way to represent this information. Current git head shows \"N days behind\" for example, instead of a percentage, which is certainly more useful. It also bases the progress calculation on the number of (estimated) transactions, rather than the number of blocks (which is very fast initially, and very slow at the end).",
