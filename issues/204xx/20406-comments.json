      "body" : "@laanwj I agree it should be rare, but there is at least one real world scenario where such an extreme value can be passed without it being a bug in the call site. In `PrioritiseTransaction` we call `FormatMoney(nFeeDelta)` on fee deltas. Fee deltas are allowed to be outside of the normal `MoneyRange(â¦)` as pointed out by luke-jr in another PR.\r\n\r\nAFAICT we don't put a lower or upper bound on fee deltas (besides being `CAmount` of course), so I thought it was safest to define `FormatMoney` and `ValueFromAmount` for the entire `CAmount` including the `std::numeric_limits<CAmount>::min()` corner case :)\r\n\r\nSome additional context: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20383#discussion_r523250890 :)",
