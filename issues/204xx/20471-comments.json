The breakdown is roughly:\r\n\r\nGlad you got it to work eventually to build the library with C++17. It doesn't matter that the intermediate tools are built with C++11. It's a bit strange though that it seems to resist being built with C++17 at every step.\r\n\r\nWould this be solved by upgrading Qt?\r\n",
