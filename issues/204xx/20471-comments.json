We've seen some problems in that regard in the past. \r\n\r\nAnd especially building with an older C++XX than the application itself could cause some things to be missing that are conditional on the C++XX version.\r\n\r\n> Note that when you look at the DEBUG output for these changes when building Qt, you'll see objects being compiled with a mix of C++11 and C++17. The breakdown is roughly:\r\n\r\nGlad you got it to work eventually to build the library with C++17. It doesn't matter that the intermediate tools are built with C++11. It's a bit strange though that it seems to resist being built with C++17 at every step.\r\n\r\nWould this be solved by upgrading Qt?\r\n",
