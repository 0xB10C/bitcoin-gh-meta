   "body" : "Aplies a patch to Qt that fixes the non-determinism by modifying Qt. The source of the non-determinism is how LLVM 8 optimizes qt_intersect_spans when compiling. The particular optimization that seems to be causing the problems is that a temp variable is being added for spans->y. For some reason, when it does this, it chooses different instructions to use when making that variable. We bypass this problem by patching qt_intersect_spans to always make and use this local variable.\r\n\r\nPotential alternative to #20436 and #20440",
