      "body" : "I think it would be better to have the new code in `MultiChainBitcoinTestFramework` replace the existing code in `BitcoinTestFramework` instead of selectively overriding it, given that it seems to be backwards compatible. All you would have to do is add a new optional named argument to `split_network` and `setup_network` and interpret it in the backwards compatible way when it is not specified. I guess I don't see a reason to add code duplication and complexity with a new `MultiChainBitcoinTestFramework` class (even temporarily with the \"ultimate intention\" of merging it later).\r\n\r\nAlso I think I would prefer a more flexible and predictable mechanism for splitting the network than the `chains` argument provides. What about a `splits` argument that takes a list of indices into self.nodes where splits should be inserted into the network? E.g. if you specify `num_nodes=6` and `splits=[1,3]` then node 0 would be standalone, nodes 1-2 would be connected, and nodes 3-5 would be connected. Other advantages of this scheme beyond more flexibility is that I think it would be more explicit and simpler to understand and implement since it wouldn't involve floating point calculations to figure out what the splits look like.",
