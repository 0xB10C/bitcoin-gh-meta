I don't see anything there about making checkpoints and being able to start from a checkpoint.\r\n\r\n==============\r\n\r\nAlso I forgot to mention that when starting from a checkpoint, the user should probably use some other method other than the bitcoin network to verify that the highest block's hash & height & difficulty match what others have.  It might be worthwhile to verify block headers starting from the Genesis block to the checkpoint block, but I don't think this actually increases security, probably a waste.\r\n\r\nMore on security: I guess you could point out that the SPKCT could collude, and you could just be connected to them, and they might lie and give you false utxo data, and shield you from getting correct utxo data.  But then I could point out that if they are able to do that, then they could even do that with today's start from Genesis method.",

The software using the chain state has to be shut down/stop processing blocks, its all manual, etc.  I want to make bitcoin easy to use for everyone.  Start it up and it works fast and easy!\r\n2. \"Provided you trust it\", sure if it was signed by a Trustworthy that would help, but it would not be nearly as good as my suggestion. See Step 6 in my solution.  See \"Security/Reliability Improvement\".",
