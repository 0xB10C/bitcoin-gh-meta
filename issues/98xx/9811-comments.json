      "body" : "At what point do \"we\" give up on automatic fee calculation? It seems like something a computer will never be able to do properly. I think we need to improve the tools that provide information to the user, to help him make as good a decision as possible when it comes to fees. I dont know. Maybe the way in which blocks are produced have to change. For example braiding/juteing to reduce variance. I really dont know. But i think trying to make automatic fee estimation work is starting to become a headache. \r\n\r\nMaybe a simple fix in this case could be \"Warning, an unusal number of minutes have passed since last block so the fee estimation may be unrealiable at this point\" Or something like that.",
