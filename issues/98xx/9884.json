The purpose of the allow-revsig-commits file is just this - if a key is revoked, for whatever reason, you commit the list of hashes so that we still allow the sig, but only for commits that were known prior to the revocation.\r\nBecause Pieter revoked those subkeys with \"superceded\", we could try to check that flag, instead, but I'm not sure if you can re-revoke with a new flag like \"compromised\" later.",
