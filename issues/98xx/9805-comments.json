I've been monitoring the seed for a while so let me add some additional data about the seed: it returns about 50% reachable nodes and (from my vantage point) has ~100ms latency. The stale rate is a bit high-ish, but that might be easy to fix.",

Didn't know anyone else was monitoring it.\r\n\r\nI reset the database on it a week ago or so when I upgrading the seeder to @sipa's latest bitcoin-seeder code, so possibly that's why the stale rate is a bit high; maybe needs time to collect more data? Specifically it's running commit https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder/commit/d54f39a1eeb7ddb0638396755d3a76abbd4c41ef, with one small patch to also return full-RBF flagging nodes (as does my testnet seed).",
