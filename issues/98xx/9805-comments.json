I've been monitoring the seed for a while so let me add some additional data about the seed: it returns about 50% reachable nodes and (from my vantage point) has ~100ms latency. The stale rate is a bit high-ish, but that might be easy to fix.",

Specifically it's running commit https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder/commit/d54f39a1eeb7ddb0638396755d3a76abbd4c41ef, with one small patch to also return full-RBF flagging nodes (as does my testnet seed).",
