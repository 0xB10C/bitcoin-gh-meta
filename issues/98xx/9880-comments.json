      "body" : "While concept ACK, note that collision attacks on sha1 signatures - particularly in selfsigs - aren't as insecure as you might think. The reason is they're basically an attack on yourself. For instance, in the case of a selfsig, you already can add multiple subkeys to your PGP identity anyway, and you can do so without revealing that fact to the public, so there isn't a direct attack vector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, given that a git commit signature is an expression of trust anyway, creating two commit objects so you can sign both with the same OpenPGP signature isn't a clear attack on anything; unlike the case where someone inserts a malicious *file* into the Git tree, that can only be done by the signer\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with second-preimage attacks that third-parties can do, [almost every cryptographic hash function in history has proven immune](https://z.cash/technology/history-of-hash-function-attacks.html). In fact, in my OpenTimestamps Python library I note that [even MD5 is secure enough for timestamping](https://github.com/opentimestamps/python-opentimestamps/blob/b395fcc25354184cb2c6a3a899f671f62af4ab44/opentimestamps/core/op.py#L311) (though I'm still not inclined to add support for it out of a healthy sense of caution!).\r\n\r\nNow there *are* more complex cases where this stuff matters - timestamping is one of them depending on how it's implemented - so we probably should still merge this for the long-term. But we can certainly wait until people fix their keys.",
