This line happens shortly after \"mapAddressBook.size() = 1\" in debug.log, so it isn't obvious what these addresses are -- especially confusing when -disablewallet is set.\r\n\r\nIt may help if I explain why I noticed this. Previous versions of bitcoin would log setKeyPool.size, mapWallet.size, etc., even when the wallet was disabled, but that has now been fixed. So this line now stands out.",
