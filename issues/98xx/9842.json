   "body" : "Commit 9db8eecac1c713c760c0217b6acb7455c657fa8b improved the\r\nassert_raises_jsonrpc() function for better testing of RPC failure\r\nmodes. This commit continues the job by removing remaining broken\r\ntry-except RPC testing from individual test cases and replacing it\r\nwith calls to assert_raises_jsonrpc().\r\n\r\nNote that this does not fully complete the job. This commit replaces the try/except code with assert_raises_jsonrpc() only for those test cases where no changes to bitcoind were required (ie the test cases weren't necessarily fully testing the behaviour, but the behaviour was correct anyway). For any test cases where fixing the test code has revealed bugs or inconsistencies, I'll raise a separate issue/PR (eg #9738, #9714, #9841, #9710). There are a few more of those to come.",
