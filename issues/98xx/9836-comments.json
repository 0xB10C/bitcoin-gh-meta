There is the consideration that v4+onion can degrade anonymity due correlation, although there is currently no warning if serving on both networks. In that case it wouldn't matter if this was on, but since users are most familiar with the standard onion hidden service then the expected behavior should remain as is. The option can exist for those who want to run open nodes on v4+onion and make the best use of their bandwidth in supporting the p2p network.",
