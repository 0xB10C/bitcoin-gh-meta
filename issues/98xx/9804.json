   "body" : "This PR fixes up a couple places where the codebase has semi-risky uses of 0 subscript. I don't think any of these are actively bugs, but some of them are unsafe (or unexpected-errors) for unsanitized inputs (such as in addrdb or key.cpp).\r\n\r\nThis also allows us to eliminate some bounds checks, so I guess this is a net-negative patch. I don't think any of those bounds checks are performance sensitive, but worth double checking in review.\r\n\r\np.s. I also fix some confusing code in murmurhash (with non obvious offset-math) as it took me a little bit to see that it was correct, could separate that out if desired.",
