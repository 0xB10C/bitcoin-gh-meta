My recollection from when I was working on this before is that this won't make much difference (because at the end of the block heuristics like this are basically random), but I could be mistaken.\r\n\r\nThere is another change to the sort that I intended to propose/test, which is to set the ancestor feerate score for a tx to be the min(feerate, feerate with ancestors) -- this would be analogous to what we do for descendant feerate sorting (where we use max(feerate, feerate with descendants).  My hypothesis is that we'd get a small performance boost by not having to re-sort low-fee children of high-fee parents when the parent was selected for inclusion.  (Also it might make the ancestor feerate score more useful for other heuristics, too...)\r\n\r\n",
