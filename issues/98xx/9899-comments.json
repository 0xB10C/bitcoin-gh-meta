The expired and here deleted keys where only used for gitian builds <= 0.11 (not for git commit signatures).\r\n\r\nI have pushed the new key to some keyservers, but, this repository seems to give more security then a gpg key server, this is why I think gitian keys should be stored here,... also for the reason that they could Ã¢ÂÂ in theory Ã¢ÂÂ be shipped with the deterministic built binary in order to verify new builds.\r\n\r\n",
