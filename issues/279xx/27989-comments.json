      "body" : "What about all the other networking and wallet related files in `/util`? E.g. we should probably also move `asmap.cpp`, `bip32.cpp`, `bytevectorhash.cpp`, `error.cpp`, `fees.cpp`, `syserror.cpp`, `message.cpp`, and `readwritefile.cpp` out of `/util`. These pure moves of entire files are very straight forward, so I feel like when we do this, we should do all of them at once as part of integrating the kernel library into the internal compilation units. My fear is that this will otherwise create too much rebase churn for the open PRs if it is done piecemeal.",

      "body" : "Concept -0. I don't think it's a good thing to remove everything from util that isn't used by the kernel. I think util/ is a good home for general purpose code providing basic data structures and cross platform capabilities, and I think common/ is good home for project-specific code that needs to be shared between bitcoind, bitcoin-cli, and bitcoin-wallet.\r\n\r\nIt can make sense to move code from util/ to common/ if the code relies on an external dependency, or has global variables, or something else we don't want in the kernel. It might also make sense to move code to common/ if it is very specific to our own applications and doesn't belong in a library accessible to other applications.\r\n \r\nBut this networking code doesn't seem much different than the filesystem code in `util/fs_helpers.cpp` or pipe code added in `util/signalinterrupt.cpp` from #27861 so I think it fits better in util/ than common/ organizationally. There may be other reasons to move things, but I don't think \"not currently required by kernel code\" is enough reason by itself.",
