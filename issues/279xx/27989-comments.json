      "body" : "What about all the other networking and wallet related files in `/util`? E.g. we should probably also move `asmap.cpp`, `bip32.cpp`, `bytevectorhash.cpp`, `error.cpp`, `fees.cpp`, `syserror.cpp`, `message.cpp`, and `readwritefile.cpp` out of `/util`. These pure moves of entire files are very straight forward, so I feel like when we do this, we should do all of them at once as part of integrating the kernel library into the internal compilation units. My fear is that this will otherwise create too much rebase churn for the open PRs if it is done piecemeal.",
