   "body" : "Replace calls to `AsBytePtr` with calls to `AsBytes` or `reinterpret_cast`. `AsBytePtr` is just a wrapper around `reinterpret_cast`. It accepts any type of pointer as an argument and uses `reinterpret_cast` to cast the argument to a `std::byte` pointer.\r\n\r\nDespite taking any type of pointer as an argument, it is not useful to call `AsBytePtr` on most types of pointers, because byte representations of most types will be platform specific or undefined. Also, because it is named similarly to the `AsBytes` function, `AsBytePtr` looks safer than it actually is. Both `AsBytes` and `AsBytePtr` call reinterpret_cast internally and may be unsafe to use with certain types, but AsBytes at least has some type checking and can only be called on `Span` objects, while `AsBytePtr` can be called on any pointer argument.\r\n\r\nThe change was motivated by discussion on #27973 and #27927 and is compatible with those PRs",
