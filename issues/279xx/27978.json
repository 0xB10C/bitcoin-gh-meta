   "body" : "Replace calls to AsBytePtr with direct calls to reinterpret_cast. AsBytePtr is just a wrapper around reinterpret_cast. It accepts any type of pointer as an argument and uses reinterpret_cast to cast the argument to a std::byte pointer.\r\n\r\nDespite taking any type of pointer as an argument, it is not useful to call AsBytePtr on most types of pointers, because byte representations of most types will be platform specific or undefined. Because it is named similarly to the AsBytes function, AsBytePtr looks safer than it actually is. Both AsBytes and AsBytePtr call reinterpret_cast internally and may be unsafe to use with certain types, but AsBytes at least has some type checking and can only be called on Span objects, while AsBytePtr can be called on any pointer argument.\r\n\r\nThe change was motivated by discussion on #27973 and #27927 and is compatible with those PRs",
