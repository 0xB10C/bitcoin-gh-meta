The wallet is old and has balance. Yesterday there was no problem. \r\nRecently updated for V24 to V25. All was working ok until today. Node is not pruned.\r\n\r\nDisk that blocks are stored is external Toshiba with USB connection, i have just a soft link between .bitcoin/blocks to blocks at Toshiba. I have repaired this disk a couple of times using windows disk tools. I did a repair because bitcoincore wanted to reindex blockchain. After the repair bitcoinore was ok (not asking for reindex) and continue syncing.\r\nTried this command: bitcoin-cli listaccounts and get error code: -32601/ Method not found error message\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nload my wallet\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nrun bitcoin-qt or bitcoind, all working ok except wallet loading\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n\"Wallet disabled!\" from bitcoind running messages\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPre-built binaries\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv25.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nFedora Linux 38\n\n### Machine specifications\n\nintel 8265U i5 cpu/16g ram/samsung evo 850 ssd drive/ external usb  disk for blocks storage",
