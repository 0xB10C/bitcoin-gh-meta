      "body" : "Given the current fee rate estimation algorithm has no prediction power when the mempool conditions change, it is common to pay too little or too much, what is especially true while we increase the confirmation target.  \r\n   \r\nIn Wasabi we use the feerate histogram to \"correct\" the fee rate estimations provided by our node and to keep them between an acceptable range. There are many things that can be done but we just want to be sure our users participating in coinjoins don't pay more than everybody else and also that they don't pay too little and are among the top 200Mb txs, just to reduce the chances of been purged.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/6a7c8965cec291f41aab328a684ab8105653a8ac/WalletWasabi/Extensions/RPCClientExtensions.cs#L147\r\n\r\nI think that something like this is not risky and it can improves the estimations by making them \"safer\". Basically, the idea is to mimic what we humans do: look at the mempool and if the txs that pay more are paying 50s/b don't pay 100s/b because it makes no sense, or at least it doesn't in most of the cases.
