Without knowing how that website works, I'd assume that your nodes will appear there at some point if they are configured correctly and connected to other nodes in the network.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you need open the p2p port (default: 8333) on your router (i.e. \"listening\")? If that doesn't help I'd recommend contacting the owner of the website with your query.\r\n\r\nEither way, this issue tracker is not a support forum for unaffiliated websites, so I'm going to close this issue out.",
