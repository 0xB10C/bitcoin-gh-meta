I guess it is odd that msan didn't complain about this, but other than that there shouldn't be anything needed here.\r\n\r\nOur MSan job actually passes the correct `CFLAGS` otherwise it would (i assume) not work properly. Our oss-fuzz builds are also not affected since they also set their own `CFLAGS` and don't use `--with-sanitizers`.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to do this for our fuzz targets that call secp code (e.g. the targets added in #27479), otherwise we end up with less seeds/coverage in our corpus. Just seems annoying to have to remember to set `CFLAGS`.",
