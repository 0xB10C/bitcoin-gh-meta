   "body" : "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nJust an example (this feature request is not related to mutinynet in any way) - https://mutinynet.com/tx/68be05aec97b7d114e978185f0df76e494196e2b160330c97870b284f444e1c4\r\n\r\nLet's suppose the miner wants to recycle coins (and shrink the total number of UTXOs) by making an all-fee transaction and eventually mining it. Any other miner would be happy to mine such a transaction if it is relayed to the network.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd `maxrelaytxfee` parameter, similar to its `min` equivalent which is present at least since 9d14e689c8, later it became a configurable.\r\n\r\nThe value could be in percentage of the amount sent. An absolute number (like the other similar configurables use) may be less helpful here when tho point is to stop broadcasting mostly all-fee transactions.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nThe usual way how UTXOs work is that they retain their full history back to the block from whose coinbase they come.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nIn case of large-scale recycling maybe the chainstate can get back below 6 GiB (at the moment it is 6.3 GiB big). Also the \"ordinals theory\" may require some rethinking.",
