   "body" : "Based on and replaces part of #25361, part of the BIP324 project (#27634). See also #19225 for background.\r\n\r\nThere are two variants of ChaCha20 in use. The currently implemented one uses a 64-bit nonce and a 64-bit block counter, while the one used in RFC8439 (and thus BIP324) uses a 96-bit nonce and 32-bit block counter. This PR adds support for the 96/32 variant to our existing ChaCha20 classes, in a very simple way (just changing initialization); most of the changes are in tests (test vectors and adapting fuzzers).\r\n\r\nFor those who reviewed the original PR, the biggest change is here that the 96-bit nonce is passed as a Nonce96 type (pair of 32-bit + 64-bit integer) rather than a 12-byte array.\r\n",
