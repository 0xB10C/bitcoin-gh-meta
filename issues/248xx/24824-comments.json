Your commits will need to be squashed before anything is merged in any case.\r\n\r\nAddressing the uncleanliness of this PR. Should this be PR remade? I can squash from here on out, I will learn from my mistakes but am still newish to git.\r\n\r\nThe larger issue to determine is if downloading a blob at runtime any better than parsing http://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html as makeseeds.py does right now? The other option would be to determine an acceptable database size for the ip to ASN database? I don't foresee anything smaller than 1MB with trimming and compression.\r\n\r\nThings to compress the ASN database would be to \r\n\r\n- Use a tree like structure where a node is an ASN and would connect to ranges it controls\r\n- Instead of writing the whole IP Address in the end range field, use the number of consecutive ip addresses owned in that block\r\n\r\n_Edit: Would a duality solution where the user could download an ASN file and if detected makeseeds would use it, If no ip->asn database file exists then the failover would be to parse http://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html as makeseeds is doing right now._\r\n\r\nThe issue as presented in #17020 suggests to not hardcode an ASN and then place it in a file in the same way as suspicious hosts are. The ASN directory is quite massive and doesn't follow any specific patterns due to the fact it's a registry of real world relations. Thus a hardcoded dataset with potentially billions of entries will require quite a bit of space.\r\n ",
