But to me, the damage is done. My hope was that by having a well-documented coding style years ago, we could start converging on a single style. If having such a document isn't enough to get people to follow it, then that's a sign we simply don't enforce coding styles. That's ok - it can stay as a description of the used style rather than defining the rules people should follow - and in that sense it's great that you're trying to reconcile them.\r\n\r\n> If the project maintainers really feel that this (I think useful?) convention should be avoided, I trust that @ryanofsky and I will stop adding code that violates the desired style policy.\r\n\r\nI don't have any problems with lowerCamel or distinguishing member functions from non-member functions, but changing the policy is just a step backwards in terms of getting the style consistent, and consistency was more important to me than individual style decisions.\r\n\r\nThere are also reasons that make it inherently hard to follow a consistent style too - beyond anyone's control even. For example, the documented style doesn't match STL's, so when code gets added that implements STL interfaces, it's forced to violate whatever style we have written up. So perhaps my hope wasn't realistic in the first place.",
