In the original PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15382#issuecomment-462370972 Garzik pointed an alternative from a 2016 blog post. Interesting that repo does have some ongoing development: https://github.com/arun11299/cpp-subprocess\r\n\r\nIt doesn't support Windows (well) at the moment, but that might be acceptable since we already (temporally) Windows support anyway.\r\n\r\n> Happy to split this out into a separate issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nIndeed seems better to have a separate issue. Swapping out the implementation of `RunCommandParseJSON` should have no impact on the rest of the architecture.",
