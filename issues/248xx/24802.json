There is scope of improvement on how the related files are fetched. In this `git grep` with `subprocess` is still used as I found it to be the simplest. Any pointers on this are appreciated.\r\n2. Removed sort operation on the matching files as I couldn't think of any strong arguments to have it. Any pointers on this are appreciated.\r\n3. Not important, but one small detail is that the previous implementation was storing matched files for all the `function_names` iterated so far. Fixed that in this PR. ",
