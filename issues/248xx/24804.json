I have rebased the PR and addressed @jonatack's nit suggestions.\r\n\r\nAdd sanity asserts for return value of `CBlockIndex::GetAncestor()` where appropriate.\r\n\r\nIn validation.cpp `CheckSequenceLocks`, check the return value of `tip->GetAncestor(maxInputHeight)` stored into `lp->maxInputBlock`. If it ever returns `nullptr` because the ancestor isn't found, it's going to be a bad bug to keep going, since a `LockPoints` object with the `maxInputBlock` member set to `nullptr` signifies no relative lock time.\r\n\r\nIn the other places, the added asserts would prevent accidental dereferencing of a null pointer which is undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: Adam Jonas <jonas@chaincode.com>\r\nCo-Authored-By: danra <danra@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.

Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review.
