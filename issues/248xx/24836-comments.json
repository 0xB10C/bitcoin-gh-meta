I expect to have this before package relay (users shouldn't be expected to construct packages themselves imo), but just haven't implemented it yet. LMK if this is something you want now.\r\n- Add `maxfeerate` to allow users to set a maximum package feerate. This just requires adding a `TestPackage` codepath separate from testmempoolaccept so we can say \"just kidding\" if the validation succeeds.\r\n",
