Considering that they deal with the address used for self-advertising (and thus for getting incoming connections) I don't really understand why they make use of `IsReachable()` in the first place. Shouldn't this affect only outbound connection logic?\r\n\r\nvasild's [answer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22834#issuecomment-914265670):\r\n\r\n> I think the logic is this - if a network is not reachable then we cannot accept connections from it. \"Reachable\" in the broader English word meaning, not the stricter -onlynet meaning. For example, a host/OS may have support for both IPv4 and IPv6 but its ISP may only support IPv4. So, an operator would run -onlynet=ipv4 to avoid attempting connections to IPv6 hosts and from advertising an IPv6 address to which the rest of the world cannot connect.",
