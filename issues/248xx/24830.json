   "body" : "This drops the `No proxy server specified. Use -proxy=<ip> or -proxy=<ip:port>` error when `-noproxy` or `-proxy=` command line arguments are specified, and just makes bitcoin connect and listen normally in these cases.\r\n\r\nThe error was originally added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20003 to prevent a bare `-proxy` argument with no assignment from clearing proxy settings. But it was implemented in an overbroad way breaking `-noproxy` and `-proxy=` arguments as well.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is to prevent a GUI bug that happens with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936, reported in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936#pullrequestreview-937685759 by vasild, that happens after a proxy setting is enabled and disabled in the GUI. But this change also makes sense on its own to remove a potentially confusing error message, and make parsing of the `-proxy` setting handling consistent within the `InitParameterInteraction`, `AppInitParameterInteraction`, and `AppInitMain` functions.",
