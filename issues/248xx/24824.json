   "body" : "### Per the request task number 1 in issue #17020 , \"Read ASNs from a file instead of hardcoding\"\r\nThe function 'lookup_asn' has been replaced in a drop in manner by a tab separated value (.tsv) file loader class and function set. 2 files were added. 'ansdecode.py' which contains a class that loads a ,tsv file and has member functions that replace existing ASN lookups that are performed by parsing http://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html. The second file by default is ip2asn.tsv. This file has the format of rangeStart\\trangeEnd\\tasnNumber\\t...\\n only the first 3 columns of the TSV are loaded additional columns can be included by will only make importing less efficient by doing so.\r\n\r\n**Advantages**\r\n\r\n- Faster: on an Intel Xeon 2699v4 Linux time was reduced from ~2:40 to ~2:05\r\n- Can be used without an internet connection\r\n- Auditable data format\r\n- Asserts on class load with the ample information to identify broken/corrupt lines in the input file\r\n- IPV4/6 Detection is included and could be used to replace the need for manual definitions in makeseeds.py\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages**\r\n\r\n- Uncompressed ASN database unmodified is 26MB - https://iptoasn.com/ - Data is public domain\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\n- ansdecode.py can be included into the makeseeds.py at the cost of additional file length\r\n- deliberate use of a class to make testing and auditing of IP hex strings to integer possible.\r\n- The TSV file could be converted to a CSV easily\r\n- The TSV file could be downloaded at runtime instead of being included",
