I think this should be already working as you would like it to, but the RPC responses that you are seeing may be confusing. \"reachable\" false means only not reachable in the context of outbound, I think. And that the onion address is not in \"localaddresses\" seems to be the same issue noted in #25669.",

      "body" : "`onion=` is only used to specify the SOCKS5 proxy for making outgoing connections to the Tor network. Because you do not want that you do not need to specify this option.\r\n\r\nJust `-externalip` should suffice to achieve your goal (or `-externalip` plus `-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` but I guess you already have those or the defaults work for you).\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to create a Tor service (for accepting incoming connections on the Tor network):\r\n\r\n1. Automatically using the Tor control API, I guess this is already happening in your case because you say \"Tor starts working...\". If `bitcoind` cannot find the Tor control, you would need to specify `-torcontrol` and `-torpassword`. See [Automatically create a Bitcoin Core onion service](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/62c864605a3d082855dbbb839d969c2ffc7acace/doc/tor.md#2-automatically-create-a-bitcoin-core-onion-service) in `doc/tor.md`.\r\n2. Manually, by configuring the Tor daemon, described in [Manually create a Bitcoin Core onion service](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/62c864605a3d082855dbbb839d969c2ffc7acace/doc/tor.md#3-manually-create-a-bitcoin-core-onion-service).\r\n\r\nAnd finally - you have found a bug! It will hopefully be resolved by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24835. `-onlynet` is supposed to only affect outgoing connections, but subtly, it also affects `-externalip` in a way that addresses supplied to `-externalip` are ignored if `-onlynet` is given and does not list the network of those addresses.\r\n\r\n@fjahr is right - the RPC output is confusing because reachable is only in the context of outbound. You should be able to get incoming Tor connections even now, but your Tor address is not advertised to the network, so nobody knows about it, which could be a reason why you do not see any incoming Tor connections.",
