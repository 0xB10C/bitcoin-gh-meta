   "body" : "Recent discussions among LN devs have brought back on the surface concerns about the security of multi-party funded transactions against pinnings attacks and other mempool-based nuisances. The lack of full-rbf transaction-relay topology connected to miners open the way to cheap and naive DoS against multi-party funded transactions (e.g coinjoins, dual-funded channels, on-chain DLCs, ...) without solutions introducing an overhead cost or centralization vectors afaik . For more details, see [0]. \r\n\r\nThis PR implements a simple `fullrbf` setting, where the node always allows transaction replacement, ignoring BIP125 opt-in flag. The default value of the setting stays **false**, therefore opt-in replacement is still the default Bitcoin Core replacement policy. Contrary to a previous proposal of mine and listening to feedbacks collected since then [1], I think this new setting simply offers more flexibility in a node transaction-relay policy suiting one's application requirements, without arguing a change of the default behavior. \r\n\r\nI'll post on the ML soon to invite operators with a bitcoin application sensitive to full-rbf (e.g dual-funded LN channels service providers) or mempool researchers to join a bootstrapped full-rbf activated peers network for experimentation and learning. If people have strong opinions against the existence of such full-rbf transaction-relay network, I'm proposing to express them on the future thread.\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-May/003033.html\r\n[1] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-June/019074.html",
