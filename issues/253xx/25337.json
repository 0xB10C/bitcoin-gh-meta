   "body" : "### Context\r\n\r\nThe wallet's `m_address_book` field is being accessed directly from several places across the sources.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nCode structure wise, we shouldn't be accessing it directly. It could end up being modified by mistake (from a place that has nothing to do with the wallet like an RPC command or the GUI) and cause a bigger issue: like an address book entry 'purpose' string change, which if done badly (from 'send' to 'receive'), could end up in the user sharing a \"receive\" address that he/she doesn't own.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nEncapsulate `m_address_book` access inside the wallet.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nExtra Note:\r\n\r\nThis is the initial step towards decoupling the address book functionality from the wallet's sources. In other words, the creation of the `AddressBookManager` (which will be coming in a follow-up PR).",
