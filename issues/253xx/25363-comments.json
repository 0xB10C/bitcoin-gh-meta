      "body" : "> Is the goal here to update the error messages to something more descriptive as well as the documentation for this RPC?\r\n\r\nThere are multiple possible angles here:\r\n\r\n- Update the error message. Note that error messages have limited space and are not supposed to be documentation, though, so this can at most be a hint.\r\n\r\n- Add RPC documentation. At least mention in the help that the functions don't work with descriptor wallets. Adding instructions on how it can be done with descriptor wallets is even better, though also see next point.\r\n\r\n- Add a dedicated \"porting guide\" to port a code base from legacy wallets to descriptor wallets.\r\n\r\n- Make the functions backwards compatible. I don't personally like this very much, as it's just something that will be deprecated and removed again later in the interest of not cluttering the API.\r\n\r\n> I've never touched documentation for this project before, is it just to edit the object returned by importaddress function in backup.cpp that returns a RPCHelpMan object?\r\n\r\nYes.",
