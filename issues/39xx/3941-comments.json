I think some restructuring would be needed to accomedate this.\r\n\r\nThe tab pages are 'wallet tabs', internally part of the wallet view. The debug window is not supposed to have anything to do with a particular wallet(view) but with the P2P client itself. Apart from being inconsistent this would give problems in case multiple wallets could be loaded, for example (there would be multiple walletviews, each containing the debug window?)\r\n\r\nAlso in no-wallet mode the tabs don't appear at all. This complicates the code between 'debug window as window', 'debug window as wallet tab', and 'debug window as main widget'.\r\n\r\nThe Debug window could be a 'wallet' at the level of WalletFrame not WalletView. This reduces the amount of cases to two again: 'debug window as walletframe child' and 'debug window as window' in the case of no-wallet mode the debug window would be the only 'wallet'.\r\n\r\nie\r\n\r\n    BitcoinGUI\r\n        WalletFrame (could be renamed to something else if it can contain other children as well...)\r\n            WalletView [Wallet 1]\r\n            WalletView [Wallet 2...]\r\n            RPCConsole [Debug window]\r\n",
