This example looks us english (i think at least, sorry its not my mother language), but totally slang and therefore I see the de_at translation as completely unappropriate.\r\n\r\nI don't say anything against fun/joke translations like \"pirate\" etc.. But not as a serious translation for 9 mio normal people, which just have set their OS language to de_at, just because they live in austria.\r\nI was really scared when i started 0.9 the first time, because I thought there is something criminal (virus, manipulated binary,...) happening.\r\n\r\n@cs, @musha68k can you confirm this maybe?",
