The exceptions were similar, so I'm sure this was indeed due to a non available wallet.dat file.\r\n\r\nThe odd parts after thinking more about it: I have multiple wallets in the datadir and rename them before use. After the incident the wallet.dat was indeed missing, but one with the previous filename was there (I wasn't really aware of this earlier), timestamp of last change: the time when the transaction was initially broadcasted. I tested this \"renamed\" wallet immediately which lead to the \"wallet.dat corrupt, salvage failed\" dialog.\r\n\r\nAfter another test a few minutes ago: the corrupted wallet file is now accepted.",
