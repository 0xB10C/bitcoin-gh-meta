Copy \"Sample Bitcoin.conf\" from https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin\r\n3. Search about the newer configuration options (ie. disablewallet is not listed in the wiki)\r\n4. Finally edit the file with your settings\r\n\r\nI believe that on installing Bitcoin Core, if no bitcoin.conf exists in %appdata%/Bitcoin a new one should be created with all options available in that release and some comments about every setting (like the wiki sample file).\r\n\r\nI dont know how to make a pull request for this idea.",
