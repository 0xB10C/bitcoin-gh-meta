This will prevent those unnecessary re-requests and when the parent is cleared from recentRejects on a new block, the orphan will have been cleared as well. \r\n\r\nFuture improvements may be to intelligently save rejected txs (for compact block reconstruction) or rerequest rejected parents (in case of CPFP) but for now this is an improvement.",
