It will be removed for 0.15 and we should clearly be communicating that.\r\n\r\nPrior arguments about whether priority was still in use analyzed the data in different ways.  I believe @luke-jr looked just to see if some transactions were sorted by priority and included earlier in the block as a result, and found this to be happening with what he considered some frequency, I think he said 6% in 2014.  I, on the other hand, looked at what percentage of transactions were included in the block at all that would not have been on a strict feerate sort and found this to be less than 1%.  This analysis is now a year old and happened before we removed the default 50k priority space.  I can't imagine it's more than a negligible number of transactions now.\r\n\r\nMore to the point.  There is no reason for the reference code base that everyone uses to support complicated logic that we don't believe to be of general benefit just because some very small minority wants the functionality.  It should be implemented with patches or helper programs that apply prioritisetransaction and the burden on creating and maintaining such functionality should be on those who want it.",
