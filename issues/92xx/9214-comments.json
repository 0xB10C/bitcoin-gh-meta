This will require a fairly extensive P2P protocol rework for us for full support (as we're limited to 128 bit 'addresses' at the p2p level.); but we could still support the new style HSes without rumoring.\r\n\r\nWhile we're discussing this, is there any good way that we could determine which HS a given localhost connection was coming from? We could use that for certain kinds of anti-DOS mechanisms. ",
