      "body" : "@paveljanik I reverted the univalue changes. Using namespaces anywhere is generally a bad idea. The primary reason is explained better than I can [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721/why-is-using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice). The gist of it is captured in this sentence: \"Library Foo 2.0 could introduce a function, `Quux()`, that is an unambiguously better match for some of your calls to `Quux()` than the `bar::Quux()` your code called for years. Then your code still compiles, but it silently calls the wrong function and does god-knows-what. That's about as bad as things can get.\" Also, a user may see namespace use in one file and think it's fine to do it elsewhere.",
