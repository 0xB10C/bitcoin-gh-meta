One could only block requests that come from a specific node, where the node gets identified on an upper application layer, not on IP layer. But that ID, I guess, could be spoofed / changed dynamically.\r\n\r\nI would suggest for the case that IP banning does not make sense with onlynet=tor, banning should be automatically disabled when running as tor hidden service.",
