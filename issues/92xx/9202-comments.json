In this specific case it's not too bad, though, because the call is already from a function (State::KeepRunning) called inside the benchmark. So there is quite some overhead already, making reordering by a few instructions probably unnoticeable in the noise.\r\n\r\n> and that if you can't use rdtscp instead, then you should add a serializing instruction first like cpuid. \r\n\r\nI didn't know that. Although rdtscp seems not to be available on all x86 processors. I'll leave that as a future improvement.\r\n\r\nx86 is already precise and low-overhead compared to the ARM path which has to do a syscall (the instructions aren't available to user-space).\r\n\r\n> Also do you not have any issues with the thread migrating to another core? I had to set cpu affinity.\r\n\r\nIndeed, calling bench with e.g. `taskset -c 0 bench_bitcoin` will likely get more precise cycle measurements.",
