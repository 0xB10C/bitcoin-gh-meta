      "body" : "As a change to selectively change the current double-negative warnings into errors, I think this PR is well put together, but I think a simpler alternative to this would be to forbid the double-negative syntax entirely.\r\n\r\nTo take an example, I think we should only support negation syntax like `-noupnp` and `-noupnp=1`, and that we should start treating `-noupnp=0`, `-noupnp=23`, and `-noupnp=jerry` as errors for any option, regardless of whether it is boolean or not. The double negative syntax is confusing and doesn't have any uses that make sense.\r\n\r\nForbidding double-negatives across the board rather than only forbidding them selectively would be a lot easier to explain in release notes. (I disagree with the \"no release notes are required\" in the PR description because the PR forbids configurations that were previously accepted, so users should have a heads-up about that.)\r\n\r\nForbidding double-negatives uniformly instead of selectively would also be a much simpler change than this. It should basically be a one line change turning the current warning into an error.",
