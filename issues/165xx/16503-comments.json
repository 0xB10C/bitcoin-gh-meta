I think the intent was that it's possible to run the node without P2P enabled at all, even though it's currently not an option.\r\n\r\n(or maybe the idea was to make various parts more loosely coupled to have more flexibility in the initialization sequence)\r\n\r\n>  assert(g_connman) in interfaces::ChainImpl::relayTransaction\r\n\r\nYes, please do this. Otherwise, in the case of a bug in the initialization sequence that skips the P2P initialization it runs into a null pointer exception.",
