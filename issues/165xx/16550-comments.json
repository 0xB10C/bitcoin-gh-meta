Most of the dependency libraries are linked statically, but not the C library. `libc` is linked dynamically. Because not doing so is risky because of, among other things, DNS lookup issues.\r\n\r\nThis means that they won't run on systems with another libc such as musl libc. There have also been more subtle issues with libc compiled with different security flags, missing `__stack_chk_fail` for example (can't find the specific issue).\r\n\r\nAlso if with flatpak, it's possible to link Qt dynamically which means the UI can do desktop integration, use the right theme, adapt to global settings (whether GNOME or KDE) and so on.\r\n\r\nIt also provides application sandboxing.\r\n\r\nI like this idea but I have no idea what would be involved with ,say, integrating a flatpak build into gitian (or guix)  build.",
