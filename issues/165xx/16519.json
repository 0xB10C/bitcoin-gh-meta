It should eliminate the `guix pull' step of the Guix\r\nbuild process.\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNot ready for merge yet, as we're waiting on https://issues.guix.gnu.org/issue/36777 to be resolved. The issue is that inferiors don't work for a certain range of Guix versions, which is a minor issues, but should be addressed before we do this.\r\n\r\nAlso, this currently relies on my repo located here: https://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin-guix, which is fine because we do similar things in other places, but I'd like to move this repo under the `bitcoin-core` org if at all possible.",
