   "body" : "Based on #16524 \r\nAfter that PR, this shouldn't change functionality, it only change names for booleans and their getters and inverts one of them.\r\nBut pink floyd fans should remain happy because the following line still contains a double negation, one in C with \"!\" and another in camel-serpent English with \"Accept*Non*std\":\r\n\r\n```\r\nfRequireStandard = !gArgs.GetBoolArg(\"-acceptnonstdtxn\", chainparams.DefaultAcceptNonstd());\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though some people and bots can fairly claim this PR follows all the rules for \"pure bikeshedding PR\"  detection, I think it overall doesn't change the fact that it doesn't make the code much more non readable, or rather...unreadable, but rather the opposite is true.\r\n\r\nIf my purposely not non-ugly writing style for this PR doesn't fail to demonstrate the absence of any potential danger in adding any redundant negations on any code from the perspective of anyone, I suggest that person shouldn't miss the opportunity to grep \"fRequireStandard\" before and after this, and judge what is clearer in that sense too.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can just go ahead and have -acceptnonstdtxn be false by the fault, similarly to what was done in #16534 , always warning testnet and regtest users that they now have to add the following to their config files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[main]\r\nacceptnonstdtxn=0\r\n[test]\r\nacceptnonstdtxn=1\r\n[regtest]\r\nacceptnonstdtxn=1\r\n```\r\n...if they want things to keep working as before.\r\n\r\nThat would simplify the code further at the cost of complicating the next release notes.\r\nBut I'm all in favor of that idea, much more than ```s/!RequireStandard()/DefaultAcceptNonstd()/```\r\n\r\nThis does need concepts acks more than anything: those are practically utACKs after #12524 , which should be judged independently, just like all the commits in this PR, they're just related.\r\n\r\nSorry for the length, but I thought I needed to prove some points the commits themselves don't prove very explicitly.\r\n\r\n",
