Now it is 0 by default for all chains. Testnet and regtest users will have to add fallbackfee=20000 to their configuration if they weren't setting it and they want it to keep working like before.\r\n\r\nShould I propose them to the wiki for the release notes or only after merge?\r\n\r\nFor more context, see \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16402#issuecomment-515701042\r\n\r\n",
