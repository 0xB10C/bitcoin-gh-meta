      "body" : "@kallewoof is not a problem with signet, it's a problem with my PR. I've played a bit with a regtest node on a commit before it. If I generate thousands of coinbase txn, every time we hit `nNextResend` (once in a 30min period), and 5min older than last block we are going to call `RelayWalletTransaction` for every one of them. You can see them in this method if you add a printer before `IsCoinBase` check. Previously printer was only triggered if they have been accepted by mempool. Now, with the new refactored `SubmitMemoryPoolAndRelay` we have removed these checks, because they are already performed in `BroadcastTransaction` or lower, and log print whatever their mempool acceptance/relay are. The resend logic has always been there for unconfirmed txn, it's just now we see it. \r\n\r\nWhile waiting for this logic to be rationalized, to avoid spam we can move log print to `BroadcastTransaction` after inserting successfully in mempool or re-add both `IsCoinBase` and `GetDepthInMainChain` checks in `SubmitMemoryPoolAndRelay`.\r\n\r\nNote: IMO, comment \"only rebroadcast unconfirmed txes older than 5 minutes before the last block was found\" in `ResendWalletTransactions` is ambiguous and suggests confirmation check has already been done at this step, but in fact it relies on the callee function to do so.",
