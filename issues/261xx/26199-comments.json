At the same time, it *heavily relies* on `MaybSendAddr` to actually do something, not much would change if you drop the duplicate subset (what this PR does).\r\n\r\nOne real difference this could make is that due to the \"makes a probabilistic decision to either advertise what they think we are or what we think we are\" of this behavior, we could have ended up having two self-ads in one ADDR message (one added here, one added in `MaybeSendAddr` if they are different). I don't think this is a show-stopper for this PR. I don't think we want to preserve this behavior.\r\n\r\nUPD:\r\n\r\nAnother important difference could be the time between the two calls. This might make sense if there's a risk of someone inserting our self-ad (`PushAddress`) with the wrong metadata, eg `nTime`. Then our latter self-ad insertion would be dismissed (because we just look up the key), while the VERSION-one is protected from this issue.\r\nI don't think this is a show-stopper for this PR, although this surface could indeed be improved (e.g., handle duplicates better, or handle other-nodes-announce-us-through-us differently).",

      "body" : "> One real difference this could make is that due to the \"makes a probabilistic decision to either advertise what they think we are or what we think we are\" of this behavior, we could have ended up having two self-ads in one ADDR message (one added here, one added in `MaybeSendAddr` if they are different). I don't think this is a show-stopper for this PR. I don't think we want to preserve this behavior.\r\n\r\nYes, advertising both addresses is something that can happen, but only in a few cases:\r\ne.g. if the address during version message processing is AddrV2-only, it is not sent out because we haven't gotten `sendaddrv2` yet. I think it might happen if we discovered a local IPv6 address and our peer sees us under a IPv4 address? \r\nI think that if this is something we really want, we could always advertise both (similar to your commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19843/commits/10fc62f0c29f640fdefc7114576133fbf18c488a) but I'm not sure it is necessary - after all, we have the [nScore](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f59e91511a3aa8b2770eeec7034ddc1a9dec918b/src/net.cpp#L245) logic to make an educated guess which address is better.\r\n\r\n>Another important difference could be the time between the two calls. This might make sense if there's a risk of someone inserting our self-ad (PushAddress) with the wrong metadata, eg nTime. Then our latter self-ad insertion would be dismissed (because we just look up the key), while the VERSION-one is protected from this issue.\r\nI don't think this is a show-stopper for this PR, although this surface could indeed be improved (e.g., handle duplicates better, or handle other-nodes-announce-us-through-us differently).\r\n\r\nI think I don't understand this completely, but the time between advertising during version message and `MaybeSendAddr` should usually be negligible, because `m_next_local_addr_send` is initialized to `0`, so `MaybeSendAddr` always advertises right after the version handshake is completed.\r\nAlso, we clear `m_addr_known` right before self-advertising in `MaybeSendAddr` ([code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f59e91511a3aa8b2770eeec7034ddc1a9dec918b/src/net_processing.cpp#L5086)) so it wouldn't be possible for an attacker to do something like preventing us from self-advertising by sending us our own address.  Is that what you meant?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "code review ACK 1002cd193d6f4ae216181aafae80076511645df3. this PR improves the encapsulation of self-advertisement logic, which simplifies the code as well as our mental models of addr relay on the network.\r\n\r\n@naumenkogs \r\n> Another important difference could be the time between the two calls.\r\n\r\n@mzumsande \r\n> I think I don't understand this completely, but the time between advertising during version message and MaybeSendAddr should usually be negligible, because m_next_local_addr_send is initialized to 0, so MaybeSendAddr always advertises right after the version handshake is completed.\r\n\r\nAgreed, but I'd take it slightly further. I think there is no difference in when the advertisement would actually occur. the `ProcessMessage -> version` logic called `PushAddress` which (at best) adds the address to `m_addrs_to_send`. The actual constructing & sending of the message wouldn't occur until the `SendMessages` loop calls `MaybeSendAddr`.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMy understanding of this PR is that there would be no tangible behavioral differences in the cases where the `version` logic returned the same address as `MaybeSendAddr` logic. on master, if they result in two different addr, I believe we would advertise both. after this PR, we would only advertise the result of `GetLocalAddrForPeer`, which will select one of the two.\r\n\r\nSince the `version` logic always prioritized `GetLocalAddress` (aka what we think we are), the behavioral difference would occur in instances when `GetLocalAddrForPeer` (aka weighted guess) selects the result from `IsPeerAddrLocalGood` (aka what peer thinks we are). \r\n\r\nI think the only time this would cause a connectivity issue is if your peers are somehow reporting your address to be something that can't be connected to, and you would have advertised something usable with `GetLocalAddress`. I expect this to be quite rare, but additionally your self-identified address would eventually get out when `GetLocalAddrForPeer` selects the result of `GetLocalAddress`.\r\n\r\n> I think that if this is something we really want, we could always advertise both (similar to your commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/10fc62f0c29f640fdefc7114576133fbf18c488a) but I'm not sure it is necessary - after all, we have the [nScore](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f59e91511a3aa8b2770eeec7034ddc1a9dec918b/src/net.cpp#L245) logic to make an educated guess which address is better.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons I stated above, I agree. Advertising both seems unnecessary, and the worst case should just be slower time for inbounds to connect to you?\r\n\r\n@mzumsande @naumenkogs curious to hear your feedback. do these claims track with your understanding?

In my reading of your comment, I'm not sure it \"takes further\" in that sense.
