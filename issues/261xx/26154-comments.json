The code as it is now is not broken nor necessarily wrong either.\r\n\r\nYes, it could be a problem if the test is removed, but it's unlikely that the test will be removed, and if it is removed, the line can be just as easily moved at that time.\r\n\r\nPRs like this just end up being noise both in terms of open PRs, and in code churn. While this probably won't cause anything to need to be rebased, that doesn't mean that we should be shuffling things around just to make the code look nicer. Having random refactors like this also breaks `git blame` which we want to avoid so that it's easier to figure out original rationale for a change.",
