   "body" : "This pull request is mostly a code-move of chainparams related functionality into the kernel library. @dongcarl is the original author of this patchset, these commits were taken from https://github.com/dongcarl/bitcoin/tree/2022-03-libbitcoinkernel-chainparams-args-only. \r\n\r\n#### Context \r\n\r\nThe bitcoin kernel library currently relies on code containing user configurations through the `ArgsManager`. This is not optimal, since as a stand-alone library it should not rely on most of the user-defined configuration. Instead, its interfaces should accept control and options structs that control the kernel library's desired configuration.\r\n\r\nA lot of tweakable parameters are defined within `CChainParams` and depend on access on the global `ArgsManager gArgs` instance. \r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the chainparams code of chainparams.cpp/h and chainparamsbase.cpp/h into parts depending on `gArgs` access and parts that don't. These are then moved into separate files within the kernel/ directory.\r\n\r\nThough a lot of code had to be moved and reshuffled to accommodate to the validation of both `gArgs` and options structs, the behavior should not change by the hand of this PR. \r\n\r\nSimilar work towards decoupling the `ArgsManager` from the kernel has been done in \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25290, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25487 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25527. Similar PR's are open in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25862 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25152. \r\n\r\n#### Currently Identified Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe patches touch a large amount of consensus critical code. I tried to keep the change sets as incremental and easy to review as possible, but a lot of manual comparison of diffs will have to be done.\r\n\r\nThere is no patch done yet introducing the kernel/chainparams.cpp/h into the kernel namespace. Such a change would be very intrusive to the entire codebase and hard to review as part of this patch set. Due to its intrusiveness, I am not sure whether this is the correct path forward or not. \r\n\r\nThe `globalChainBaseParams` global had to be moved into the kernel chainparamsbase.cpp in order to allow calls to `BaseParams()` from contexts without access to gArgs. This is not ideal, but was the only way forward I could think of so far without basing this pull request on more prior work decoupling `gArgs` from the various call sites of `BaseParams()`.",
