This was after I did the wallet migration, but before I verified the descriptors. In the 1.5 days I was AFK, my node shut down because I ran out of disk space. When I came back I had to reload the legacy wallet before I could take a look at the descriptors. I'm assuming this is to be expected, and did not have to reload the wallet when I tried this test a second time.\r\n- I witnessed several of crashes in the GUI when I was testing wallet restoration, but I think it was related to the situation I just described with my node stopping because it was out of disk space. When I restarted the node, I turned pruning on. Upon starting the GUI, I was prompted to agree to a reindex, which I did. Despite that, I still had crashes while trying to restore a wallet. This seems like an edge case though, and I'd expect there to be unpredictable behavior before the reindex completes. I unfortunately didn't capture any logs for this because I initially thought it had to do with reloading a wallet to a data directory that already had the wallet loaded. I figured I'd just retest and get logs then. However, I went on to test that scenario and there were no problems.\r\n- Regarding the escaping for the `importdescriptors` command mentioned in previous comments, the test guide uses a combo of single and double quotes, and stores the descriptor in a variable. This seems to reduce the total number of annoying quote escapes that have to be made. I know this is technically a CLI thing as opposed to a bitcoin core thing, but mentioning it in case it can help with documentation.",
