I think this should just be removed entirely, and if someone wants to suppress it (regardless of if they are building with -Werror), they can add `-Wno-return-type` to their CXXFLAGS.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you can't make the change (in it's current form) until after 25972. Otherwise the CXXFLAGS being dropped will cause the CI to fail. (another reason to just add it to CXXFLAGS when required, including in the CI).",
