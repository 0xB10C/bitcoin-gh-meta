I do understand how this could be a challenge for the team, and I certainly am not trying to create work.  Unfortunately, at this time, I am pretty locked into Snow Leopard.  I hope to be able to move forward (perhaps through the use of virtual machines?) at some point during the next 12 months, but I would need a working installation of Bitcoin Core long before then.  For me, it isn't a matter of just dragging my feet or not wanting to upgrade, I'd prefer to be on El Cap, if for no other reason than security patches.  I just have to be patient for the time being.\r\n     You asked if I can \"compile other c/c++ code?\", to which I say, \"I'm not sure\".  I haven't had need to do so recently.  Does anyone have a recommendation as to a simple build I could try to test this?  My only requirements are...\r\n\r\n1. Needs to be a trusted code base -- I can not afford to add any security vulnerabilities, and\r\n2. Needs to be easy to build...  I'm not afraid of the CLI, but I don't live there.  I can follow a well written \"how to\" but following instructions and understanding what one is doing are two completely different things.\r\n\r\nThank you, Mr. van der Laan\r\n\r\n-----\r\npaveljanik,\r\n\r\nHopefully the below file is what you are looking for...\r\n\r\n[config.log.txt](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/files/224390/config.log.txt)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI appreciate the work that you all do for the community.  As before, please let me know if there is more that I can do to help...\r\nRegards",
