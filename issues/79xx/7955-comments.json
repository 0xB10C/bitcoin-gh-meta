      "body" : "Alas, I like this a lot but I think we can't use the existing mempool command for it:  It's not filtered by set inventory known. (it's also computationally expensive even when fee filter is used).\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like is a \"TOPMEMPSYNC\", which is functionally equal to mempool but considers only the top 2*BLK_SIZE txn in 'fee-rate' order (actual order can be implementation defined but should approximate mining preferences), and also filters its output through setinventoryknown. Then you can pick a peer and keep pulling from it every block and get one more block worth of transactions one block ahead of needing them.",
