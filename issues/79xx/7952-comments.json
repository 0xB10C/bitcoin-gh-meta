Looks like the CSV fork activated and the 0.12.1 clients followed a different chain when block=00000000000005354772cb50ea2decd1e9176724c41eb3427197943aea33194e  height=787391 encountered \"ERROR: ConnectBlock: contains a non-BIP68-final transaction\". The 0.12.1 chain is longer height wise, but has lower work so the older clients reject it right now. That wasn't the case last night. Last night, my client was not sync'ing to the most work chain because it was hitting the \"Large reorg, won't direct fetch to ...\" case in the `headers` message processing. That I thought was kind of interesting from the standpoint of what would happen if SPV mining created a bad chain 17 or so blocks long in production. My node seemed stuck at that point, just sitting there not really doing anything.",
