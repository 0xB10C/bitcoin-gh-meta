   "body" : "#### Reasons for another notification interface\r\n* Currently there is no interface that could be extended to \"private\" notification secured behind the authorization (like peers connected/disconnected or a new wallet relevant transaction notification)\r\n* HTTP long poll notifications are very easy to set up and require almost no dependencies\r\n* HTTP long poll notifications can easily pushed over the internet using httpd reverse proxy together with a popper authentication method (certs or http auth digest) together with TLS.\r\n* HTTP long poll would allow connecting applications to do all kinds of things with just a single communication channel (currently you need RPC & ZMQ for most use cases which would require VPN or a fancy multi port stunnel connection to broadcast the notification over the internet)\r\n\r\n#### How does it work\r\n* The listener calls the `pollnotification` RPC command.\r\n* If no notifications are available, the RPC thread will idle for a given timeout (30s by default)\r\n* If a notification was fired during the 30 seconds, the longpoll call will be responded with the new notification(s)\r\n* The client/listener can immediately reconnect and wait again\r\n* If notifications are already in the queue, the `pollnotification` command will immediately response.\r\n* Notifications can't get lost (possible to lose them during http transfer and if one exceed the queue limit)\r\n\r\n#### Downsides\r\n* JSON encoding overhead\r\n\r\n#### New RPC calls\r\n`setregisterednotifications [<notificationtype>]` (possible types are `hashtx` and `hashblock`)\r\n`getregisterednotifications`\r\n`pollnotifications`\r\n\r\n#### Missing\r\n\r\n- [ ] More tests\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\nI'd like to use a such interface to work on a remote GUI (use case: GUI on your local desktop, node on a VPS).",
