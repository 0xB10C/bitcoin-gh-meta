However, there are\r\nedge cases where this assumption could be violated (eg using invalidateblock /\r\nreconsiderblock), so just check for this case and revert to inv-announcement\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nFYI I encountered this bug once while running `mempool_packages.py`, and was able to reproduce reliably by repeatedly invoking `invalidateblock`/`reconsiderblock` on the tip.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps we should backport this to 0.12 as well?",
