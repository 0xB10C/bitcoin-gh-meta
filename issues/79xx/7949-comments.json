This avoids having to store any client-state in the server - at least for longer than the request lasts.",

Extending this PR so it would support a client chosen UUID would not be very complicated (a set of queues and a set of registered notification types). Clients could register notification types along with a client-chosen UUID.\r\nI might extend this PR to support multiple listeners.",
