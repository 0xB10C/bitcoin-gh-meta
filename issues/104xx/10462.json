   "body" : "This is @shaolinfry 's implementation of bip8, but rebased, with some minor nits by myself freely applied, some squashes and with some sensible renames left out for later/before (whatever is decided, that's just self-documentation; orthogonal. Didn't separate s/BIP9SoftForkDescPushBack/VBSoftForkDescPushBack/ because I don't think it's worth it: it helps for review IMO and it's minimal).\r\n\r\nPlease no merge before we decide what to do with my new TODO comment lines (I want to add something to bip8 for warnings), but I think review for bip8 as it is now can begin at any time.\r\nKudos again to @shaolinfry not just for the idea but also for the cleanness: I enjoyed reviewing and rebasing this.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't read commit messages:\r\n```\r\nIf flag set, transition to LOCKED_IN on timeout.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n- Add BIP8 reporting to getblockchaininfo RPC\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- always show warnings with bip8-compatible unknown deployments becoming\r\n  active, just like bip9 did with all bip9-compatible unknown deployments\r\n```\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nCurious: longer branch in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/compare/b15-bip8-min...jtimon:b15-shaolinfry-bip149",
