This would have caught a bug in #10321 (which had `script-diff` instead of `scripted-diff`) by reducing the reviewer burden from noticing a correct `scripted-diff` to that or a correct VERIFY SCRIPT (using fairly fuzzy rules).\r\n* When a mismatch occurs, print out the unscripted part of the diff of a commit.",
