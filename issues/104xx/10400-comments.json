This would work just as well on windows.\r\n",

Checking the PID file was the most simple and with the least changes to the codebase I could think of - while still being useful (I am not familiar with the Bitcoin core and have not worked with C++ since 2010).\r\n\r\nSo, if you think this command is useful for inclusion in the core, I could work on improving it and then squash the commits in the end.\r\n\r\nShould this information be its own command or should it be included in another existing command - if so, which one?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRicardo Velhote",
