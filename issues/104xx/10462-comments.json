And it's still quite simple.\r\n\r\n> FWIW I have deliberately held back on any PRs to Bitcoin Core until nearer the time.\r\n\r\nWhat time? BIP8 is a generic mechanism that can be used for any future deployment.\r\n\r\n> I don't think \"NOMERGE\" pull requests are helpful, better to just have a serious pull request.\r\n\r\nI think this PR is very serious as it provides the implementation for the current bip8 specification.\r\nI added \"NOMERGE\" because of the TODOs, because I want bip8's specification to change (and then change this PR to add the suggested addition), please, see https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-May/014417.html\r\n",
