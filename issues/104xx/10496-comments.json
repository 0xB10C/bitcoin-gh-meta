      "body" : "@ryanofsky thanks. I actually did it like this in a first iteration, but changed it because I figured that the arguments should be evaluated as much as possible before entering ConnMan. After all, ConnMan doesn't particularly care about the command line string representation.\r\n\r\nIt was a bit weird having the error messages that relate to `-whitelist`, `-bind`, `-whitebind` still in ConnMan as opposed to where the arguments are actually parsed.\r\n\r\nEdit: I see the point though that `Lookup()` etc. are network functions and shouldn't be used in init.cpp. But refactoring all of that sounds like a separate issue, so I propose to defer this to another PR.",
