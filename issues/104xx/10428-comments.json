Activation is done by economic majority, the reason one may want to use an optional parameter is because measuring if the network has reached a suitable economic majority is not as straight forward as measuring signalling blocks, one should activate the flag once they are confident a suitable percentage of the economy intends to activate the flag. The fork is convergent as long as there is an economic majority or miner majority backing it since miners ultimately mine the most profitable chain. A hard fork like BIP102 however is never convergent.",

I expect wallets, exchanges and companies not implementing sufficient protections for chainsplit. Not even Core is working on it.  \r\n  \r\nHowever it seems like the ginny is out of the bottle, the disruption is unavoidable, it's hard to tell how big it will be.  \r\nI was wondering if having a temporary (and already unavoidable) UASF disruption is a bigger risk, than crippling the Bitcoin development and the scaling of Bitcoin?  \r\n  \r\nWhile the answer to that question can be vague, but more importantly we should decide **when does not merging UASF by default becomes a bigger systemic risk than merging it?**  ",
