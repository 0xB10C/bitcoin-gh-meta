   "body" : "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI am working on a tool that displays information about a bitcoin node using RPC. One of the parameters I would like to include is the `uptime` of the bitcoin daemon. Currently, as far as I can tell, there is no way of obtaining such information.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking a bit on how to perform this task, I concluded that the easiest way to do this is to check the modification time of the `.pid` file. This has however the disadvantage that it does not work in Windows because the `.pid` file is not created.\r\n\r\nI propose the following solution for your review and opinion about this new command before I work further on this. Do you think this new command makes sense? Please consider it a WIP/PoC as it does not have any error checking.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample return from the RPC command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bitcoin-cli uptime  \r\n{\r\n  \"uptime\": 696\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand the help function:\r\n```\r\n$bitcoin-cli help uptime  \r\nuptime\r\n\r\nDisplay the uptime of the Bitcoin server.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRicardo Velhote",
