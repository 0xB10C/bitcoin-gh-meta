   "body" : "A few code changes were needed to accompany the test:\r\n\r\n* Adding setObjectName() calls for a few Qt controls to make them easily\r\n  accessible from the test.\r\n\r\n* Calling contextMenu->popup() instead of contextMenu->exec() to open\r\n  the transaction list context menu without blocking the test thread.\r\n\r\n* Opening the context menu at the contextualMenu event point rather than\r\n  the cursor position (this change was not strictly needed to make the test\r\n  work, but is more correct).\r\n\r\n* Updating the bumped transaction row with showTransaction=true instead of\r\n  false. This is needed to prevent the bumped tx from being hidden, so the last\r\n  part of the test which attempts to bump the bumped tx can work. (Technically\r\n  this change is a more general bugfix not limited to the testing environment,\r\n  but the bug doesn't happen outside of the testing environment because in the\r\n  full Qt client, a queued NotifyTransactionChanged notification causes the row\r\n  to be updated twice, first with showTransaction=false, then immediately after\r\n  with showTransaction=true.)",
