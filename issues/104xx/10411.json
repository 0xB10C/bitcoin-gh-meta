So far, I've only used it to receive bitcoin.\r\n\r\nThe rpc command 'getnewaddress' gives out addresses that have already received bitcoin. I would think the bitcoin client, no matter what machine it runs from looks at what addresses have received bitcoin and then give out a clean unused address.\r\n\r\nI've performed a start up with -rescan, but same result.\r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue? \r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nTell us what should happen\r\n\r\nreceive an unused address, no matter which one of identical wallet.dat files are used. \r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nTell us what happens instead\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\nList the version number/commit ID, and if it is an official binary, self compiled or a distribution package such as PPA.\r\n\r\n0.14.1 32 bit from bitcoin.org, not self compiled.\r\n\r\n### Machine specs:\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 14.1 \r\n- CPU: Intel duo\r\n- RAM: 1 G\r\n- Disk size: 200 Gb\r\n- Disk Type (HD/SDD): HD\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\nThis is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file.
