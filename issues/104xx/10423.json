The temp directory can be left intact by using the `--nocleanup` argument as usual.\r\n\r\nImplementation: Define a SkipTest exception type. Catch it in the test_framework and go through the normal test teardown functionality. Similar to the [SkipTest exception class in Python's standard unittest library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.SkipTest)\r\n\r\n@sdaftuar ",
