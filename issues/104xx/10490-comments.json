I think it's been like 5+ hours, since there was a spike in the required fees, and estimatesmartfee is still suggesting insane fee rates (while for hours ~120 sat/byte transactions have been getting confirmed).\r\n\r\nHere's a bit of a visualization:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1237\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-06-02 at 11 14 37 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9326759/26750487/945eb272-47e9-11e7-88e2-2908ca0b1489.png\">\r\n\r\nWhile 0.14.1 is returning saner values (350 sat/byte).\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAlso the \"conservative\" argument for estimatesmartfee doesn't appear to do anything. I have not been able to observe a singe case of it actually changing the returned feerate, which seems odd.\r\n\r\n@morcos   ^ Ã°ÂÂÂ ",
