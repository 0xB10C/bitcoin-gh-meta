That's fine)\r\n\r\nI think it might be useful for the user if there was a bit more information in the error message. Up to you how verbose you want to go, but a couple of things that might be good to include:\r\n\r\n- how does the user fix this problem (reindex, which will cause a full chain download if this is a pruning node)\r\n- what if the `Failed to rescan before time <time>` is for a time before the user specified as the address birthday? eg what if the user set the birthday to 10am, and we failed to scan a block at 9:55am. We'd return an error  saying `Failed to rescan before time 9:55am` and the user might thing \"that's ok, my key's birthday is 10am\". In fact it's not ok, because the 9:55am block may include a transaction for that address, since block time is not canonical or monotonic.",
