I think you'd agree that, while some places on the internet have very strong support, there are many businesses, miners, and exchanges (all of whom are also users of the system) who do not support BIP 148 (though many more support SegWit), at varying levels of disagreement. You may want to peruse some of my thoughts on why consensus is both critical, and why we should all be requiring consensus before agreeing to anything at http://bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2017/02/28/bitcoin-trustlessness/. Maybe this should be locked, given the discussion is no longer about code?",
