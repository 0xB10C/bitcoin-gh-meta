Therefore, I think it is ok to bring it here, or in the [GUI](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui) repo.\r\n\r\nWe experienced similar issues at lease two times in the past, unfortunately. French and Ukrainian translations were the targets. It is still unclear what was that -- a sabotage, an act of vandalism or a blunder.\r\n\r\nIn both previous cases translation teams managed to fix everything themselves. French team also contacted to Transifex support.\r\n\r\nActually, it is translation team's responsibility. The [`zh_CN` team](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/teams/159/zh_CN/) has 197 translators, and [seone](https://www.transifex.com/user/profile/seone/) as a coordinator who has not been active for years. Why not nominate a new person or a few people for coordinator role on the IRC chat?\r\n\r\nFWIW, after the issue with Ukrainian translation, I've volunteered for a coordinator role in the Ukrainian team. And now I have backups of translations.\r\n\r\n> Besides, I hope the sabotage done to zh_CN translation could be reverted in some easy way.\r\n\r\nI guess it could be possible to restore translations from the `src/qt/locale/bitcoin_zh_CN.ts`. But it definitely requires the collaboration of the `zh_CN` team translators.",
