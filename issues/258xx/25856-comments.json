In that case, we should reject the empty taptree during parsing rather than accepting the ostensibly bad PSBT and silently dropping the bad field. The general principle for PSBT is if it came in or if we filled the field internally, then it should be serialized. So changing the serialization in this way is incorrect IMO. Rather we should not accept empty taptrees and make it impossible to add one to the psbt in our own processing.",
