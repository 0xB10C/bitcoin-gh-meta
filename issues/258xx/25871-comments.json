As with other modules in this project, the stake is **very** high for not breaking existent code or functionality. However, that is more for reviewers to achieve, rather than maintainers.\r\n\r\n> What should the general goals of Bitcoin Core (not Bitcoin) with respect to P2P & Networking?\r\n\r\nRemain decentralized (increasing the traffic requirements becomes a centralization factor at some point), accessible (one can run full node on a phone nowadays) and cooperative with other implementations. Encrypting P2P traffic over clearnet seems to be important.\r\n",

If this was just over the `lower level networking, sockets`, it's pretty clear you're one of the most active contributors there.

This includes the just-merged #25717, which is probably one of the most involved changes to our p2p logic in some time (I see you left a comment with a coverage report post-merge).\r\n\r\nIt seems a little odd to me to make someone a maintainer over an area of the codebase when they don't have a history of actively writing/reviewing the code or contributing to the higher level discussion. The complexity / nuance (and the stakes) for the net processing code are high enough that I think that having separate maintainers for that the `lower level networking, sockets` is warranted.  When you look over that same group of net processing / peer interaction PRs, there is a cohort of regular contributors that I'd think would probably be better positioned to be a maintainer for it.",

      "body" : "@fanquake,\r\n\r\nOftentimes I would skip reviewing a PR if there is already a crowd of reviewers on it. Why? On one hand, one more pair of eyes cannot hurt, but on the other hand I have to spend my scarce resources wisely. I know the fellows will bring the crowded PR into shape and thus it is better for me to review another one that is under-reviewed. I do not feel like every PR out there needs my fingerprints. Also, reviewers, in addition to finding strict bugs, post suggestions on how to improve the code. This is sometimes subjective. Too many reviewers and inevitably there will be contradicting suggestions which could be counter productive.\r\n\r\nThe BIP155/addrv2, Torv3, I2P and CJDNS PRs are missing from the list above. Sometimes modules are overlapping and boundaries unclear, but those should classify as high level peer interaction?\r\n\r\nSome quick stats for fun: in the last 2 years [389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02) P2P PRs/issues were opened. For any given contributor it is true that there are more than 100 PRs/issues in which the contributor neither commented nor authored them (was not involved). For example I only authored [56](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02+author%3Avasild) and commented on [150](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02+commenter%3Avasild), leaving 183 (389-56-150) ones in which I was not involved at all. That is, in addition to the 18 PRs from your list, there are 165 others which I did not touch. These numbers do not take into account the actual value brought into the project - maybe I only posted style nits suggestions? IMO they are mostly for fun and not for drawing conclusions.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

      "body" : "Concept ACK vasild for Networking scope maintenance\r\n\r\nI think the low-level networking is a signficant scope in itself, I would say there are many things belonging there: CJDNS, I2P, Tor, the peers monitoring tooling, the resource consumption control settings, the sockets handling, BIP324 support, likely refactoring like #25572. Beyond, it could be fruitful to monitor more actively all the ongoing development on the [Tor mailing lists](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo), and bring on the surface if there any interesting issues affecting us. Tor is permanently [attacked](https://www.robgjansen.com/publications/pointbreak-sec2019.pdf), and Bitcoin transaction-relay target could be a target so juicy that it would change the incentives to run Tor exit nodes. It could be interesting also to explore the Tor's [pluggable transports](https://www.pluggabletransports.info/how/) (though here iirc the dissemination strategy of the entry points really differs from our assumptions underlying the p2p network and the poisson distribution of block issuance is a leak itself). The anonymity network space is like 40 years old and there are [many papers](https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/date.html) to check if we could reuse insights.\r\n\r\nThe P2P stack (block-relay, addr-relay, transaction-relay, peers connection strategy) sounds to me voluminous itself, and I think it would deserve its own maintainer. The discussions there are likely to become more and more abstract and quantitative-based. Interactions with higher layers are likely to become more tight, especially as we weight things like p2p packages or transaction-relay spam mitigations. Of course, it sounds any maintenance could become more general in time, though IMHO at the really time with the complexity of the codebase inceasing,  subsystems and their maintenance are more likely to become specialized.\r\n \r\nI don't know who is handling the labeling today, though it could be constructive to introduce a new \"Net\" label to dissociate from \"P2P\" and thus offer better visibility about low-level networking PRs towards reviewers.\r\n\r\nThanks to Vasil for offering the maintenance commitment.",

Personally, I would expect a history of reviewing these types of PRs from a proposed maintainer. I can't comfortably be on board with someone as maintainer who has not shown an interest in significant changes to the proposed module (by review or authoring).\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1235663238:\r\n> The BIP155/addrv2, Torv3, I2P and CJDNS PRs are missing from the list above. Sometimes modules are overlapping and boundaries unclear, but those should classify as high level peer interaction?\r\n\r\nI disagree, the boundaries are pretty clear here. Enabling support for Torv3, I2P and CJDNS is mostly a `net` (lower level networking, connection management, etc.) change that aligns well with a `net processing` change to enable the relay of longer address formats (i.e. BIP155/addrv2). Connecting to a i2p/Tor/cjdns address obviously works even if it is not rumored on the network, meaning the `net` changes can clearly be separated from the `net processing` ones.\r\n\r\nIMO, we have achieved a decent module boundary between `net` and `net processing`.  Maintaining that boundary as well as strengthening it, is something I would like to at least see mentioned here. Any maintainer of `net` or `net processing` who does not understand this relationship would risk entangling these layers once again.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25871#issuecomment-1225679151: \r\n\r\n> It is robust. The code would benefit from some improvements internally, but it is of relatively high-quality.\r\n\r\nBy \"robust\" you mean \"it has been working for 10+ years and only with focused review attention are we able to maintain this status\"? `net processing` has close to no unit test coverage and afaict the fuzz coverage is mostly limited to a high level fuzzing target of `ProcessMessage(s)` (Aside from a couple components like `TxRequestTracker` or `TxOrphanage` which are also fuzzed. A trend that I would like to see continued!). In my view, this currently makes `net processing` quite brittle to subtle changes that humans likely won't catch, especially with long time contributors leaving and new ones joining.\r\n\r\nYou also make no distinction here between `net` and `net processing` but (imo) the state of these two modules is not quite the same.",

Challenge is fine but it becomes a bit of a joke when someone like @vasild who has been very active in this repo for a sustained period, clearly has expertise in the scope described and brings a vast amount of experience as a software engineer prior to this project is asked to jump through these ill defined hoops. It has been brought up [previously](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524#issuecomment-1172570635) that new maintainers on this project are increasingly young, inexperienced and arguably lacking the wisdom and versatility that comes through working in industry or external projects for many years prior.\r\n\r\n> Oftentimes I would skip reviewing a PR if there is already a crowd of reviewers on it\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of thing that I would like to see from an experienced, versatile reviewer. Rather than getting their name on a PR that is already under review by a crowd of reviewers, seeking out the PRs that aren't getting attention is a positive attribute. There is room for different approaches (ultra focused on a single scope versus moving across different scopes) but highlighting the ability to add value outside of their scope as a negative seems absurd to me. It is a recipe for PRs falling between cracks because maintainers are unwilling or unable to add value outside of what they consider their scope.\r\n\r\n> It makes me wonder if the nominee has the time to be a maintainer if resources are scarce.\r\n\r\nA nonsense comment. Resources are scarce for every single maintainer, reviewer and indeed on this project in its entirety. If resources weren't scarce we would have open PRs in single digits. PR review is and always will be a bottleneck on this project.\r\n\r\n> A maintainer in name who is not involved enough could cause more problems than not. Not to mention having additional access which is a security consideration as well.\r\n\r\nThis is uninformed and frankly insulting to all the work @vasild has been doing. If you have anything to provide as evidence that suggests @vasild might pose a security risk to this project then please provide it. Otherwise he falls into the same bracket as all other current maintainers in that there was no evidence prior to them being added as a maintainer that they posed a security risk.\r\n\r\nDiscussing interlocking scopes and where the gaps are in terms of current maintainers' skillsets is fine. But can we refrain from uninformed criticism of individuals' work and abilities and certainly throwing around \"security risk\" accusations with zero evidence to back it up. It certainly isn't a recipe for attracting experienced developers to this project with expertise in areas we may be lacking.",

I had meant to voice concern that it seems a maintainer position is a large commitment and could be  bad for the project and the individual if they are over stretched or not prepared.  That's only my opinion, nothing more.\r\n\r\n> This is indeed an improvement over the no-p2p-maintainer status quo\r\n\r\nAgain, my reaction to this comment was not to say talk badly about @vasild.  I just wanted to point out that choosing any maintainer is better than no maintainer is not necessarily helpful.\r\n\r\nI disagree with how you interpret my comments, however thank you for challenging my post in case others interrupt it the same way.",

Bitcoin Core maintainers have more respect, privileges, responsibilities etc. even if we consider it 'janitorial'. Sometimes even in soft forks indirectly. Its mainly because Bitcoin has only one implementation used by majority of nodes. I am not sure about other countries but in my country, some elections are open for everyone and others are decided by people who are elected and closed door meetings between them.\r\n\r\nI don't think we are trying to create a similar system and most of the people are interested in coding rather than politics. However, it has become a part of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core for a few reasons that are irrelevant to discuss here. I was even asked to [not comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25560#discussion_r922216780) in a PR by @michaelfolkson however, I still agree with his comments in this PR.\r\n\r\n1.

Please don't insult the only 5-10 developers that focus on privacy in bitcoin as @michaelfolkson said  based on contributions:\r\n   >This is uninformed and frankly insulting to all the work @vasild has been doing. If you have anything to provide as evidence that suggests @vasild might pose a security risk to this project then please provide it. Otherwise he falls into the same bracket as all other current maintainers in that there was no evidence prior to them being added as a maintainer that they posed a security risk.",

Obviously you can only speak for yourself and not for others.\r\n\r\npersonally, no I don't think so; also I mostly agree with [dergoegge](https://github.com/dergoegge).\r\n\r\nThere are a myriad of issues in the networking stack that I think should be addressed, and so I'd like to see someone with more dissatisfaction ==> ambition to fix those issues, or at least a set of issues they think are compelling and have a plan for. To the extent we're adding a maintainer for networking, I would expect them to express more vision and leadership around how the module should be improved and how the goals (including stated ones around encryption) will be able to be moved forward meaningfully. \r\n\r\nI also strongly disagree with @vasild's statement:\r\n\r\n> I am also, always, careful to not break it. As with other modules in this project, the stake is very high for not breaking existent code or functionality. However, that is more for reviewers to achieve, rather than maintainers.\r\n\r\nFrom bitcoincore.org\r\n\r\n> Project maintainers have commit access and are responsible for merging patches from contributors. They perform a janitorial role merging patches that the team agrees should be merged. They also act as a final check to ensure that patches are safe and in line with the project goals. The maintainersâ role is by agreement of project contributors.\r\n\r\nIf a maintainer doesn't believe that maintainers are doing a final check of safety, then that's misunderstanding what contributors currrently expect a maintainer should do before merging.",

You are free to suggest a tweak to the scope if that is what is delaying your response.\r\n\r\n(edit: I looked up to see how long glozow's trusted keys [PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25524) took to get merged. It was opened on July 1st and was merged on July 7th after discussion of some people's reservations, a couple of initial NACKs and some unmet requests for phone calls etc. So 6 days from opening to merging. 3 months seems like an excessively long time for such a PR to be open to me.)",

      "body" : "Renewing my Concept ACK vasild for Networking scope maintenance.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm listening to other contributors concerns that maintainers should express some leadership and vision in the handling of their module(s) maintenance, from my opinion this will be a notifiable change in the project culture. As of today, I think the majority of the contributors opinions is to understand maintenance as a janitorial role rather than as a \"project manager\" one. That the project could benefit from more priorities communication and active coordination by and from the contributors is something for sure we can discuss, however I believe it's beyond the scope of this specific appointment proposal to vasild as a maintainer.\r\n\r\nOf course, we could still devise for an unbounded period of time what should be the current role description and all the tasks that a maintainer candidate should be evaluated to be competent to perform. However, I think this is coming in a relative blindness of the fast-evolving and highly-dynamic environment that Bitcoin open-source protocol development constitutes. I would say our design, development and release process are continuously changing and adapting to the reality of the ecosystem, e.g as the recent discussions about mempool policy changes shown up, and as such maintenance is hard to be understood as a strictly fixed set of tasks, at least from my perspective. Daily practice and initiative mindset trump over a pinned job description in FOSS.  \r\n\r\nAll that in consideration, I don't think we should save us from better defining the scope between \"Networking\" and \"P2P\" functional modules and logical boundaries, even if in the light of today's state of the codebase there is a lot of intertwined code and functions. Again, I would like to underscore a new label \"net\" would be a productivity gain by ensuring better review scope.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think we should be fairly liberal in our nomination of maintainers when the volunteering is coming from an experienced and established contributor. Technical knowledge gaps can be improved with dedicated time, and I hold the belief we can be clearly open-minded on someone learning the job on the trade. Somehow, we're all responsible to provide feedback towards maintainers in the performance of their tasks and to improve our process in a collaborative and constructive way.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm grateful we still have contributors step in to volunteer for project maintenance. As we all know, a janitorial role which is both a curse and a blessing.",
