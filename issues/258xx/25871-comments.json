As with other modules in this project, the stake is **very** high for not breaking existent code or functionality. However, that is more for reviewers to achieve, rather than maintainers.\r\n\r\n> What should the general goals of Bitcoin Core (not Bitcoin) with respect to P2P & Networking?\r\n\r\nRemain decentralized (increasing the traffic requirements becomes a centralization factor at some point), accessible (one can run full node on a phone nowadays) and cooperative with other implementations. Encrypting P2P traffic over clearnet seems to be important.\r\n",

If this was just over the `lower level networking, sockets`, it's pretty clear you're one of the most active contributors there. However for net processing and peer interaction code, I'm not sure that's the case. Looking at some of the most significant net processing changes over the past 12 - 24 months (apologies if I've missed some):\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19219\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19398\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19607\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20624\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20651\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20799\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21186\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21515\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23443\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24170\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24171\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24178\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24545\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24571\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25268\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25515\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25720\r\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25717\r\n\r\n\r\nit doesn't look like you've been majorly involved in the discussion / reviewed any of them. This includes the just-merged #25717, which is probably one of the most involved changes to our p2p logic in some time (I see you left a comment with a coverage report post-merge).\r\n\r\nIt seems a little odd to me to make someone a maintainer over an area of the codebase when they don't have a history of actively writing/reviewing the code or contributing to the higher level discussion. The complexity / nuance (and the stakes) for the net processing code are high enough that I think that having separate maintainers for that the `lower level networking, sockets` is warranted.  When you look over that same group of net processing / peer interaction PRs, there is a cohort of regular contributors that I'd think would probably be better positioned to be a maintainer for it.",

      "body" : "@fanquake,\r\n\r\nOftentimes I would skip reviewing a PR if there is already a crowd of reviewers on it. Why? On one hand, one more pair of eyes cannot hurt, but on the other hand I have to spend my scarce resources wisely. I know the fellows will bring the crowded PR into shape and thus it is better for me to review another one that is under-reviewed. I do not feel like every PR out there needs my fingerprints. Also, reviewers, in addition to finding strict bugs, post suggestions on how to improve the code. This is sometimes subjective. Too many reviewers and inevitably there will be contradicting suggestions which could be counter productive.\r\n\r\nThe BIP155/addrv2, Torv3, I2P and CJDNS PRs are missing from the list above. Sometimes modules are overlapping and boundaries unclear, but those should classify as high level peer interaction?\r\n\r\nSome quick stats for fun: in the last 2 years [389](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02) P2P PRs/issues were opened. For any given contributor it is true that there are more than 100 PRs/issues in which the contributor neither commented nor authored them (was not involved). For example I only authored [56](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02+author%3Avasild) and commented on [150](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3AP2P+created%3A%3E%3D2020-09-02+commenter%3Avasild), leaving 183 (389-56-150) ones in which I was not involved at all. That is, in addition to the 18 PRs from your list, there are 165 others which I did not touch. These numbers do not take into account the actual value brought into the project - maybe I only posted style nits suggestions? IMO they are mostly for fun and not for drawing conclusions.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
