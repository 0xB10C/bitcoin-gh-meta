      "body" : "No modification of the sources, these are exactly like with \"git pull\" from this repo (with or without the patch for dbwrapper's logger, which allows going further, and seems to avoid overwriting the stack by allocating its buffer onlce on the hep and not on the stack)\r\n\r\n(So it is version v23.99.0-22d96d76ab02-dirty; it includes all the recent modifications found in current git HEAD).\r\nNote that I CANNOT use `gettxoutsetinfo` after this crash, the RPC thread is no longer running... So if you have a way to perform this call from gdb...\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that I am approaching the case where there's some temporary object on the stack used after it should have been freed) So may be #25800 is reladed to this one (which occurs much less ofter than without the small patches I proposed in #25800).\r\nNote also that in #25800, I propose to fully memset the buffer on the stack always with zeroes (possibly enlarging its size to more than 500 bytes), if it helps reproducing the bug faster.\r\n\r\nBut it seems that the bug reported here is an unexpected effect of the recursion in CoinsView::FetchCoin (without any protection offered by its associated exclusive lock: this occurs purely inside the same thread, if there's a lock on a mutex it is already owned and there's no check to count the number of times it has been requested and block it to a limit); I also see that FetchCoin uses an iterator on a range that may not accept some modifications inside the range made by a recursive call.\r\n\r\nNote that I can reproduce this bug even when I compile bitcoind with debug=true (the default is false), this occurs always on the same block height, and with no incoming connections (prevented by firewall rules), only outgoing connections to 2 full nodes, and without performing any RPC call (so this is not caused by RPC threads).\r\n\r\nNotice that this occurs just after detecting a \"fork block\".\r\n\r\nI wonder what is the validity of this line [src/coins.cpp:48] in CCoinsViewCache::FetchCoin(...):\r\n```\r\n    CCoinsMap::iterator ret = cacheCoins.emplace(std::piecewise_construct, std::forward_as_tuple(outpoint),\r\nstd::forward_as_tuple(std::move(tmp))).first;\r\n```\r\nAnd how this reorganization made in a recursive call could affect the validy of the iterator in the parent call made via GetCoin(...). For me the semantics of std::move(tmp) is not clear. The doc says this is a **destructive read**, and the order of evaluation of this expression (which uses forward_as_tuple(outpoint) twice) may have already invalidated the state of the outpoint iterator, making tmp possibly invalid, or possibly the two forward iterators are overlapping, possibly processing the same transaction twice, including the secondtime after it was removed from the chain. These are some parts of the C++11 library that I do not understand clearly. Shouldn't we call std::move(tmp) first **before** creating the two tuples?\r\n\r\n",
