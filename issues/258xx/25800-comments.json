I've also seen in Bitcoin.io that v23 nodes seem now to be frequently stalling near the best tip. They apparently need to be regularly shut down and restarted to resync them.\r\n\r\nIn other words the logic for sync'ing nodes (even those that are not in IBD) is broken now in v23.",

However I've noted frequently that the QT version can corrupt some indexes. The Qt integrationis not completely thread safe and has race isues.\r\n\r\nIMHO, the QT version should run the daemon only in a separate process (which could be registered in Windows as a standard \"service\", without any attached console), and control it with its RPC/IPC interface. Stopping the QT interface should not stop the daemon, unless we click a button to stop the daemon by its RPC/IPC interface (or via Windows services API).\r\n\r\nAs well there should be an option to send logs not in a flat file, but to Windows Events, where they could be compressed and managed automatically with a circular buffer (internally Windows Events will be packed in *.evtx or *.etl files and have a type handler managing common strings and formaters): this also saves a lot of I/O; Windows provides tools to dump these events into a flat file if needed, and to also filter them by sources, event type IDs, or sort them in different order. This would be mostly useful for log events generated by the daemon (debug logs for the QT interface can remain in flat files, or could be sent to a different source category in Windows Events).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNote also that I use a dedicated storage partition only for the /Bitcoin data files and NOT the main system partition.\r\n\r\nI have also formatted it not with the default cluster sizes (4KB) but increased it to clusters of 256KB (because most files are very large): this significantly improves the I/O, reduces the filesystem overhead in terms of I/O and memory for the filesystem structures (allocation bitmaps are smaller and modified much less often, because database files, undo files, index files, redo-logs, and debug log files are all allocated incrementally and in parallel), it improves the filesystem cache, reduces the fragmentation a lot (when the store is on harddisks, even on a fast array), so we also get reduced latency.\r\n\r\nThis also greatly facilitates maintenance.",

      "body" : "No, version 22.0 has the same issue (though it does not have the bug present in the EXE installer for Windows caused by ASLR, due to a bug in MAKENSIS which creates an invalid EXE by when it appends the \"pcode\" compiled from the nsis.ini script, and then appends the compressed files, because it does not correctly manages the relations that are placed after them, but forgets to update the PE EXE header to the new placement of the relocation section in the EXE file)\r\n\r\nv22 tools has the same issue with the IBD which stalls as well if you use the QT interface (in addition, the bitcoin-qt.exe also corrupts the indexes; Qt is unsafe as it silently changes some global settings in the C runtime environment, and the LevelDB is also affected; it seems that Qt temporarily changes the current working directory, and files accessed by LeevlDB do not seem to specify the absolute path, so there are race conditions where some Qt threads may affect concurrent LevelDB threads.\r\n\r\nIF you use only the CLI daemon (v22 or v23), there's no such conflict and race conditions; it is faster in both cases than their QT version; but the v23 includes many fixes (multiple ones being critical) still not present in the v22 binaries (and not backported in the v22 sources).\r\n\r\nI just hope that a new v23 will be recreated soon (and there are other bugs pending to be solved, already present in the sources, but not in the precompiled binaries).\r\n\r\nIn my opinon the QT version of the daemon has not been seriously tested. And trying to link the daemon with the QT interface is an error; the QT interface should spawn or control the regular CLI daemon",

      "body" : "Also I've discovered that in some cases, during the IBD phase, if we have too many open connections with other peers, we exhaust the maximum number of allowed open files in the whole process.\r\nAs a result we get a status saying \"Error: Error reading from database, shutting down.\"\r\n\r\nBut what is worse is that during that shutdown, Bitcoind or Bitcoin-qt is unable to save its current indexing: it should first close all peer connections, make sure that they don't have threads open in existing LevelDB files or on block files, BEFORE finally saving the indexing state. This occurs much more often with the QT version probably beaue Qt itself uses many additional file handles.\r\n\r\nSo Bitcoin core is not properly handling cases where it cannot open files. If this occurs, an exception handler should first seek to terminate connections to peers with lower priority (notably incoming peers before outgoing peers).\r\n\r\nAs well there are visibly leaks of open file handles if we leave Bitcoin Core open for a long time, especially during the IBD phase. The work around for that is to run the IBD phase for a limited time (e.g. stop after half an hour). Bitcoin core should in fact make such cleanup, possibly closing all connections to peers regularly, flushing its indexing state.\r\n\r\nAs well it should NOT cleanup all files in the chainstate immediately, but should preserve at least the previous valid manifest and its attached lbd files. If ever there's been a corruption because it could not save the last chainstate, at least it has a way to restart from the previous manifest, and may be me more conservative by limiting the number of peers with which it interacts (for now there's no limit at all, and during the IBD, remote peers can request any data from anywhere, in any order, and this locks too many files, more that what is allowed in the configuration.\r\n\r\nBy default it accepts up to 125 peers, and about 2000 open files, but during the IBD and if you have multiple indexes in construction, that limit is easily exhausted (notably when you run it over a Gigabit  Internet connection): you cannot safely run the IBD phase and at the same time allow the construction of several additional indexes in parallel (e.g. with blockfilterindex=1, coinstatsindex=1, peerblockfilters=1, peerbloomfilters=1: you can only enable them one by one, after you'ev succesfully finished the IBD and each of the following phases for other indexes).\r\n\r\nSuch forced shutdown (which incorrectly states that the \"blocks are corrupted\", when in fact it could not even open them because of internal resource limits) leaving the chainstate after the shutdown in an inconsistant state (I've checked the blocks they were perfectly correct, it's just that Bitcoin Core could not open them!) and it is very harmful (because we've lost the chainstate which becomes unrecoverable and has to be reindexed once again from the begining) and as opposed to what is said, this has nothing to do with a hardware problem on the sorage or with the memory: it is architectural in the app, which does not use safe management of its own resources usage, even if the host can perfectly support more! The so called \"corruption\" is generated by Bitcoin Core itself by not properly tracking its own internal errors for its own resource usages, whose given diagnostics are wrong about their effective cause).\r\n\r\nAlso I wonder why, with the option \"reindex-chainstate\", Bitcoin core will not just run without accepting ANY incoming connections; it may just open 1 outgoing connection to a full peer, and it should be sufficient for the time needed to recover the chainstate to the last block.",

Or isn't Bitcoin Core v22+ itself misbehaving?\r\n\r\nNote that I have stopped since long trying to use the QT version (which bugs too much often). I just use the command line daemon (bitcoind) and the command line CLI query client (bitcoin-cli). In all cases these stalls or crashes are inside the management of the chainstate (there's no corruption at all in the downloaded blocks) occuring at random position (with the same valid blocks downloaded I can restart \"reindex-chainstate\", it always fails.\r\n\r\nIf I restart with \"reindex\" it forces downloading again the whole blocks, but when performing binary compares with a backup of blocks from previous runs, they are strictly identical (except \"block00000.dat\" which is special and contains the current root of the tree, updated at each run).\r\n\r\nI thought my PC was too fast, and my Gigabit figer internet too fast. I tried running the daemon in a Linux VM, by restricting its amount of memory and network bandwidth allocated in the hypervisor. Still I get the same results: It's never possible to terminate the IBD, I always get crashes by corruptions in the chainstate (some *.ldb files were deleted too early after a merge, even though they were still needed for other upper *.ldb files files; or I got the chainstate stalled as well in the IBD, and no corruption detected by the daemon).\r\n\r\nI don't know what kind of machine or specific configuration can really make Bitcoin Core working and succeed in their IBD phase.\r\n\r\nOr the Bitcoin chain already and really contains invalid blocks (that were rejected much longer after they were first accepted), that can't be eliminated and no progress is possible (in that case it is the whole shared Bitcoin chain which is damaged since long, or Bitcoin Core has forgotten to implement a rule to perform a safe cleanup of rejected blocks).\r\n\r\nAre there reliable Bitnode softwares **other than Bitnode Core v22+** that can be used today to run a full node with the current state of the chain?",

They are also failing to sync the IBD with the same symptoms in the \"chainstate\" (corruption of the chain with index *.lbd files deleted too soon, and missing, or stalling at unpredictable height).\r\n\r\nI think that those that have Bitcoin Core working on their machine had to compile it themselves. But they DO NOT use your signed binary releases (which aer most prbably not compiled correctly in a safe environment; I know you use a new build chain in \"GUIX\", but it is then not working at all: do you really test the generated binaries, which seem to be broken locally in GUIX by some unknown and unsafe/untested local customizations and patches, or running on a broken/damaged Linux installation?).\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that it is not my machines that are borken, but your \"GUIX\" environment used to produce the signed binaries. And unfortunately you've not opensourced that environment; may be you should retry by using an hypervisor like Proxmox and building a \"template\" for a safe Linux image, a safe installtion of GCC and related tools; that tempalte would then be easy to replicate when you want to make all your tests before actual releases. The sources of Bitcoin Core alone is definitely not sufficient without a safe build chain we can replicate easily. Apparently you are only testing Bitcoin core with binaries you compile on your local machines without using \"GUIX\", you never use or test the **released** signed binaries published on your official website!",
