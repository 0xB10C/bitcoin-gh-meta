I see this message only in very old versions of Bitcoin sources.\r\n\r\nSo Bitcoin v23 was compiled from some sources that were out of sync (probably on another test branch, not meant to be part of the release).\r\n\r\nIt seems also that the test for seeing if some lock must be released is inverted (so this can explain the 100% CPU use seen on one CPU core by a thread runing the tight loop almost forever, of waiting for some exception or event which will come only when we shut down)",

I've also seen in Bitcoin.io that v23 nodes seem now to be frequently stalling near the best tip. They apparently need to be regularly shut down and restarted to resync them.\r\n\r\nIn other words the logic for sync'ing nodes (even those that are not in IBD) is broken now in v23.",
