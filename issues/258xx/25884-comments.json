Onion connections are anonymous, so the attacker can't easily (hopefully not at all) distinguish users.\r\nTherefore, this is much easier to spot as an attack and it can't be directed efficiently against one single peer.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, clearnet, as much as:\r\n\r\n> It's also alleviated with IPv4/IPv6 connections (especially when using the `-asmap`\r\n  configuration option) due to the cost of obtaining IPs in many networks.\r\n\r\nappears to me much more vulnerable to targeted attack (your IP address can make you a sitting duck.), which are much harder to spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this ignored because it's considered an irrelevant distinction, or are there other reasons?\r\nTo be clear, I agree with the warnings added in this PR, I'm just curious as to why the arguments above are not considered/expressed.",
