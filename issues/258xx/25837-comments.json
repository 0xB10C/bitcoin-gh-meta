In the Preqrequisites section I installed vcpkg first.\r\n2. Under the section header **QT** I downloaded the single zip archive of QT source code. And extracted it to a folder namely **qt-everywhere-src-5.15.5\\**. \r\n3. I made a build directory using `mkdir build` and changed into it. \r\n4. Following the instructions I ran the `..\\configure -release -silent -opensource -c ....` command as mentioned there. \r\n5. Finally I ran `nmake` and after running some processes for a while it threw the above error.",
