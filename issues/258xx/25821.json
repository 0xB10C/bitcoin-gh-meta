However I can't see activity stream on Bitcoin Core's Transifex project, therefore it's difficult to track what recent changes of translated text have been made.\r\n\r\nRecently zh_CN translation seems to be sabotaged, in the way that all the translated text strings are replaced with its corresponding original English text.\r\n\r\nTo make translation contributors' life easier, I think something should be done, like what Electrum's project hosted on Crowdin currently enjoys: the activity stream feature which allows effective tracking of translated text.",
