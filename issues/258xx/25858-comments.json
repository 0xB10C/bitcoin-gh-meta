E.g., were the TaprootBuilder to be extended to contain information about MuSig derivations, in which case the changes would be more straightforward IMO.\r\n\r\nI highly doubt that would be the case. And if it were, it's not particularly difficult to deal with it then. Furthermore, the general structure of the PSBT implementation is that each field has its own explicit member inside its struct, so any future things would get their own fields, which will then be un/packed from TaprootBuilder as needed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the more correct way to implement `m_tap_tree` is to make it the vector of tuples rather than a TaprootBuilder.",
