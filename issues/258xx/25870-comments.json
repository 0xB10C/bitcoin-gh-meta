What should the general goals of Bitcoin Core (not Bitcoin) with respect to P2P & Networking?\r\n\r\nI ask because as per bitcoincore.org, \r\n\r\n> Project maintainers have commit access and are responsible for merging patches from contributors. They perform a janitorial role merging patches that the team agrees should be merged. They also act as a final check to ensure that patches are safe and in line with the project goals. The maintainersâ role is by agreement of project contributors.\r\n\r\nSo I think it is interesting to know what you think the project goals should be in this regard.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJeremy",
