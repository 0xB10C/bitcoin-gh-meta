   "body" : "This PR is a late follow-up to the [review club session about the PR \"Default to NODE_WITNESS in nLocalServices\" ](https://bitcoincore.reviews/21090#l-90) (#21090): \r\n\r\n```\r\n17:32 <lightlike> hmm, if we are in pruned mode, we first set NODE_NETWORK and then unset it later in init.cpp. that seems a bit strange.\r\n...\r\n17:33 <jnewbery> lightlike: ah yes, you're right. That does seem a bit messy.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRather than setting the service bit `NODE_NETWORK` first and then unset it (if in `fPruneMode`), start with the bare minimum flags that we always serve and only add `NODE_NETWORK` if we are running as a non-pruned node. This seems to be a more logical approach than currently on master.",
