Should I add some (how many is reasonable?) to nodes_test.txt and run that script you wrote (in this PR description) for a few days? If they are still up, move ahead with proposing them (either with a comment in this PR or a new one?)\r\n\r\nYes, we could use more and I'm looking at adding some here (we can compare notes :). As for criteria, have a look at the bottom of `contrib/seeds/makeseeds.py`; it suggests filtering by blocks received, service bit, uptime, known and recent user agent, etc.  For `nodes_main_manual.txt` I mostly proposed peers run by trusted colleagues that I could ask, if needed, whether they intended to maintain the node over time. I have only been keeping track of that kind of info for mainnet, but mentioning it in case you know some of your testnet peers.",
