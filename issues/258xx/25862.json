   "body" : "The libbitcoin_kernel library should should not be trying to read options from the command line or make `ArgsManager` calls. Instead, it should get instead get options from simple function arguments and options structs.  This PR removes `gArgs` accesses from `dbwrapper` and `txdb` modules by defining appropriate options structs, and is a followup to PR's #25290 #25487 #25527 which remove other `ArgsManager` uses from kernel modules.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not change behavior in any way. It is a simpler alternative to #25623, which is limited to removing `gArgs` accesses and defining reusable options structs, and does not affect the kernel API.\r\n",
