Things like SetNull and IsNull are low-level enough IMHO, but anything that forces more dependencies or has validation logic in, doesn't belong there.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I think uint256 should be separated into a bytes32 type or something which is just storage (but does have comparison operators, so it can be used as key in a map), but doesn't have any arithmetic logic.",
