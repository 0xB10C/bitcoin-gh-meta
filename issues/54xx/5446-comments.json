Eg we did this for `CCoinsMap`, to easily be able to switch between std::map, boost::unordered_map, etc.\r\n\r\nMy comment would be on the name `CCoinsSet` - it is way too aspecific for a *wallet-specific* type and clashes with `CCoinsMap` in that way.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, as said, I'm neutral on this, I don't think it makes much difference whether to to it for a type like this that is only used in one or two places and we'll likely never change.\r\n",
