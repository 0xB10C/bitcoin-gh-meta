Plus if you used the `vcpkg` triplet of `x64-windows-static` the library being linked should be of the form `boost_filesystem-vc140-mt.lib` (at least that's what vcpkg installed for me). If you've manually added linker inputs to the project files that would explain some of the errors.\r\n\r\n**IF** you haven't made any changes you want to keep I'd recommend the following steps;\r\n\r\n````\r\n# In your vcpkg directory (if packages are already installed these steps will be instant)\r\nvcpkg install --triplet x64-windows-static boost-filesystem boost-multi-index boost-signals2 boost-test boost-thread libevent zeromq berkeleydb rapidcheck double-conversion\r\nvcpkg integrate install\r\n\r\n# Download Qt binaries and extract to c: (has to be c: due to the way Qt hard codes paths)\r\nwget https://github.com/sipsorcery/qt_win_binary/releases/download/v1.6/Qt5.9.8_x64_static_vs2019.zip\r\nfollow steps here to verify https://github.com/sipsorcery/qt_win_binary/releases/tag/v1.6\r\nextract to c:\\\r\n\r\n# In your bitcoin repo directory\r\ngit reset --hard HEAD\r\ngit clean -fX\r\npy -3 build_msvc\\msvc-autogen.py\r\n\r\n# Open an x64 VS 2019 command prompt and cd to your bitcoin repo directory\r\nmsbuild /m build_msvc/bitcoin.sln /p:Configuration=Release /t:clean,build\r\n````\r\n\r\nBy using msbuild from the command line you can eliminate any Visual Studio configuration issues.
