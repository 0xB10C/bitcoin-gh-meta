In #17627 we had a long discussion about intentionally uninitialized variables in the RNG code. Although this is a different variable, I assume we also don't want to initialise it. Keeping the warning around until the end of time seems annoying (though not deal-breaking), and will likely lead to PRs every few months of people trying to fix it. A source code comment `//  intentionally uninitialized, see #17627 and #17895` could help, but isn't there a macro to suppress it?",
