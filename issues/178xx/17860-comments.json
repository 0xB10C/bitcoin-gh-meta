Very welcome! :)\r\n\r\nAlso: the habit of after fixing a security bug also implementing a fuzz target that could have found the bug is something I think we should strive for. I think @kcc (known for making C++ reasonably sane by introducing the sanitizers, libFuzzer, OSS-Fuzz, CFI, etc.) first coined the term \"regression fuzzing\" for that :)\r\n\r\nA good example of \"regression fuzzing\" was this OOB read in `libc++` `<random>` which not only was fixed but also got a couple of new fuzz targets added: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=994957",
