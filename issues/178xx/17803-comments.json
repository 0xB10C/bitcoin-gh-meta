GH also lets builds run over 1 hr and permits parallel jobs (I know the Bitcoin Core CI job has a special arrangement with AppVeyor but jobs on my fork regularly timeout).\r\n\r\n> There were concerns that we shouldn't put all eggs in one basket (GitHub), but it seems they are free and for appveyor we pay 50$ per month for two parallel jobs\r\n\r\nA possible plan is:\r\n\r\n - Enable GitHub Actions build for `master` only and leave AppVeyor in place (I believe the \"tick\" for a PR will depend on whether GH Actions is enabled for PR's or not).\r\n - If no problems enable GH Actions for PR's. That will impact contributors as they now have three CI systems that need to pass to get a green tick,\r\n - If no problems evaluate whether it's worth cancelling AppVeyor and saving the $50/month.",
