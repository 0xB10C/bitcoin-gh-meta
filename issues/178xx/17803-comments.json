GH also lets builds run over 1 hr and permits parallel jobs (I know the Bitcoin Core CI job has a special arrangement with AppVeyor but jobs on my fork regularly timeout).\r\n\r\n> There were concerns that we shouldn't put all eggs in one basket (GitHub), but it seems they are free and for appveyor we pay 50$ per month for two parallel jobs\r\n\r\nA possible plan is:\r\n\r\n - Enable GitHub Actions build for `master` only and leave AppVeyor in place (I believe the \"tick\" for a PR will depend on whether GH Actions is enabled for PR's or not).\r\n - If no problems enable GH Actions for PR's. That will impact contributors as they now have three CI systems that need to pass to get a green tick,\r\n - If no problems evaluate whether it's worth cancelling AppVeyor and saving the $50/month.",

This is not what we want and it might be better to disable the Action. ~~while I track down why this behaviour occurs.~~\r\n\r\nUpdate: Most likely cause for the behaviour is that GitHub triggers the Action on every event and then lets the workflow file filter them. By setting the `Enable local Actions only for this repository` permission it causes an error immediately since the `ci.yml` file on this repo is using 3rd party actions. The Action is going to permanently fail until the permission is changed or 3rd party actions are removed. Recommendation is to disable pending further investigation into permissions.\r\n\r\nSetting the permission to `Enable local and third party Actions for this repository` results in my fork only triggering on Pull requests. I think that permission level simply means 3rd party actions like the cache and checkout ones can be used in a workflow file. But until we know for sure it rules out potential for commits might be best to disable Actions again.",
