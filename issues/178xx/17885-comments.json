I appreciate you had issues installing `vcpkg` but in my experience that's unusual and it is now the de-facto Microsoft tool for installing msvc dependencies. My subjective opinion is that if anything docker adds another moving part and makes the build more complicated.\r\n\r\nThat all being said I know @NicolasDorier is a big fan of docker and maintains a lot of [images](https://hub.docker.com/u/nicolasdorier).
