Since the goal of providing `const char*` helpers is to make it possible to write simple `datadir / \"indexes\" / \"blockfilter\"` and `file + \".ext\"` expressions, another followup option might be to use some `constexpr` magic and make it a compile-time error to append non-ASCII path literals. Or yet another possible followup option could be to overhaul the fs::path implementation so it whitelists operations instead of blacklisting them as described https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24493#issuecomment-1060926539",
