      "body" : "I'm ok with doing the minimal here, but a reminder that supporting i686 is outside the goals of this project. So NACK on reintroducing `--enable-glibc-back-compat`. It's ugly, outside scope of maintenance, and as you said yourself on IRC, introducing parts of `libgcc` into our codebase is legally questionable (dunno about other libraries that look like it like LLVM's).\r\n\r\nEdit: also as said on IRC, with gitian it was the best we could do, as we were bound to ubuntu's toolchains, with guix we control the entire build environment including toolchains so could patch those if necessary. There's no excuse for having something like --enable-glibc-back-compat in the leaf bitcoin-core build.\r\n\r\nBut a more trivial solution is still preferred. Would bumping the minimum libc version for i686 help?",
