But https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22053 goes beyond that, trying to use it in a thread-safe way. I think it is best to make `FeeFilterRounder` thread-safe itself, so that it can be used without thread-safety-worries now and in the future if used in new places.",

In fact I think they are completely orthogonal:\r\n\r\n* This pull makes a utility class thread safe, so that it may be called in a concurrent context without running into UB\r\n* The other pull aims to reduce the use of the `cs_main` \"global\" consistency lock. The consistency lock is needed even in the absence of UB. Also, `m_insecure_rand_mutex` added here can't possibly achieve what `cs_main` achieves right now in `MaybeSendFeefilter`.\r\n\r\nSo I think the two pull requests are best reviewed and evaluated independently. Also, there is no dependency between them. Either can be merged before the other, or not at all.",
