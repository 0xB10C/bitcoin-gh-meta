Some parts of our code are just impossible to reach (belt-and-suspender code, `src/util/check.h`-failures, ...) and it would be good to have a mutation engine that can deal with this. It seems unlikely that we'll do major refactors to our consensus code to kill mutants, so a mutation engine that can take the fingerprint of mutants and put them in a \"harmless\"-bucket seems ideal. This would be beneficial because a large part of mutation testing Bitcoin Core is categorizing mutants into harmless/harmful and doing it at most once per mutation allows more time to be spent on \"fixing\" the harmful ones.\r\n",

If you have an idea of what would be useful to do to STL code, I imagine I could add it to UM myself.\r\n\r\nUM supports annotating a _line_ as DO_NOT_MUTATE permanently, and adding that for file or block of code would be easy (you can actually do it for a block/file now with an annotation marking as \"test code\" but it'd be nice to not have to claim the un-killable parts are test code).\r\n\r\nDownside is UM is fairly slow at generation, and doesn't inherently do any tricks to speed evaluation of mutants.  But I'm not sure a currently working C/C++ tool exists that supports that kind of thing.",
