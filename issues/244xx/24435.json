Rather than having these subtrees be copied in each of these test files, they can be pulled from a shared list so that any future changes to these exclusions can be isolated to one location rather than spread out among many files. \r\n\r\nThis first commit is a proof of concept demonstrating how this can be applied. I saw that we currently have a list of ignored words in a text file used for the spelling lint test, so I followed that general idea and moved the list of ignored subtrees into a text file as well. This can be read and parsed into whatever format we want. The extended-lint-cppcheck.sh and lint-includes.sh tests use a regex with just these directories, but some of the examples in the linked issue have additional unique exclusions so the solution needs to be able to support that.\r\n\r\nI wanted to create an early WIP pull request with a proof of concept to present the idea for discussion. There are several other areas that this list of subtrees can be used, outlined in the ref'd issue.",
