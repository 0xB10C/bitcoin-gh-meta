      "body" : "This is pretty reasonable. I know we don't generally like to move code around, but this move was probably inevitable.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion would be to rename \"util/args_manager\" to \"util/args\". I think \"_manager\" suffix does not contribute or clarify much, and will make it awkward to add other argument-handling functions and classes to the same file without attaching them to the ArgsManager class. ArgsManager class is already monolithic and it should be possible to break up or extend without putting everything inside.\r\n\r\nRelated to this, I don't necessarily see a need to put the `gArgs` variable in its own file, but if this is needed to get rid of circular dependencies, or if it just seems like a good idea, I'd suggest putting it in \"util/gargs\" or \"util/args_global\" instead of \"util/args\"",
