It's essentially an assertion.\r\n\r\nNo that was not the point when writing this code. The intention was to prevent callers from specifying their own `ATMPArgs`, e.g. using `ATMPArgs args(); args.m_bypass_limits = true;`. I wanted them to only be able to initialize arguments using the static constructors (`ATMPArgs::SingleAccept`, `ATMPArgs::TestPackageAccept`).\r\n\r\nBut as shown in the paper (and any compiler), deleting the default constructor doesn't prevent something like this. What *does* prevent this is that there's a reference in the struct so you can't create a default version of it. So deletion of the default constructor does nothing. This PR is essentially removing code that doesn't do anything and misleading/confusing documentation.",
