I think it's nice to be able to declare variables that change at runtime as `variable`, and declare variables that don't change as `CONSTANT`, and just use the choice to try to make code more understandable. It's possible a constant could conflict with a preprocessor macro, though, and this could be bad. I don't check for preprocessor macros under my bed every night, and I'm not too scared of them, but maybe I should be! So ignore this feedback if this seems like the clear way to go.",
