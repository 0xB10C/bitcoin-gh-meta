This should strengthen our guarantee that encoded float/double values are portable across platforms.\r\n\r\nIt comes with tests that verify on is_iec559 platforms (which are the only ones we support, at least for now) that the serialized bytes exactly match the binary representation of floats in memory.\r\n\r\nThis is quite possibly overkill, but even if we choose not to go in this direction, the added tests may be useful.",
