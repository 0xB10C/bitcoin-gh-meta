I'm interested in whether there needs to be many more of these kinds of footgun protections in case fuzzing goes down these uncontrolled paths. The alternative (I think) would be to say \"If you run experimental fuzzers you are on your own\". Protections such as the one introduced in this PR would just be there for the really dangerous paths.",
