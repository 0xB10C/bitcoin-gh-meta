That is documented in issue #21466 and being resolved by PR #21756. Review welcome! :)\r\n\r\n> I'm interested in whether there needs to be many more of these kinds of footgun protections in case fuzzing goes down these uncontrolled paths.\r\n\r\nThe bullet proof approach to avoiding unexpected syscalls in Linux is to use [seccomp-bpf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp).\r\n\r\nPR #20487 adds syscall sandbox support to Bitcoin Core using seccomp-bpf (opt-in at compile-time via `--with-syscall-sandbox`), and PR #21538 extends that support to detect use of unexpected syscalls when fuzzing (\"syscall sanitizer\"). Review welcome for both! :)",
