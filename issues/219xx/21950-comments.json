They may be the only pool using their own software to create block templates?\r\n\r\nI'm fairly certain they use Bitcoin Core. You can control the max block weight with `-blockmaxweight` (default is 3996000 WU). Also, F2Pool is known for running with custom patches on top of Bitcoin Core to maximize what they can: e.g. they reduced the number of sigops reserved for the coinbase. This [bit them twice](https://twitter.com/0xB10C/status/1643871608401014785) a few months ago due to not keeping that patch up-to-date.\r\n\r\nEnd of last year, Poolin also mined blocks with more than the default max block weight. See for example [762816](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000002373c6610fe88ca7a48023a7ffac351f1ff388dea93cb). The EclipseMC pool mined a few, for example, [752015](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/00000000000000000006e05b1e14860d33517d10bad0cf38f62aa452c1365bd2), the Huobi Pool with e.g. [710871](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/0000000000000000000451109149b22d6716fd1c9200c08ee295b0c6b6d82d28), and the KuCoin Pool too with, for example, [751909](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block/000000000000000000063efdbd724ae035ce4b56d512a041ad2bd139374152ff).",
