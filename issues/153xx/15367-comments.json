Yes, as an alternative software could just poll until its ready but the same could be said for blocknotifys. \r\n\r\nHistorically speaking-- startup scripts people have created for bitcoin have been uniformly low quality (e.g. making the software unusable providing no way to get access to the rpc cookie, killing the process and corrupting its state on shutdown, etc).  I have generally recommended against using these package scripts due to their low quality, so I think it would be asking a lot of them to expect them to start intelligently starting other services when so far not corrupting the Bitcoin install has been a challenge for them.",

I think the general approach is to poll the interface of interest.\r\n\r\nDocker, for instance, supports a directive to check if a container is healthy https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck \r\n\r\nSee also https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/\r\n\r\nAnyway, what if you want to trigger some command when both bitcoind and other service are up and available? You would have to poll the second. Take your example, what if you want to run something else after `bitcoind` and `lnd` are up?\r\n\r\nAlso, from the client point of view, I think it's a good practice to have retry mechanisms, no because of the startup, but because in runtime a service can be unavailable for some reason.",
