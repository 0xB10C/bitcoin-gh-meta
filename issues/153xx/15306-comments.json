People think that it needs to be updated when any key is updated in the wallet. I spent quite a long time digging into the use of `nTimeFirstKey` in my review of #15032, and you believed that it needed to be updated even when reviewing this issue, after I told you that it doesn't need to be updated! The fact that we were both tripped up by this tells me that it's confusing and should be changed :slightly_smiling_face: ",
