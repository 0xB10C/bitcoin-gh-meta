It escapes instead of removes them to still allow for troubleshooting issues where they accidentally end up in strings (it is a debug log, after all).\r\n\r\n(more checks could be added such as UTF-8 validity and unicode code-point range checkingâthis is substantially more involved and would need to keep track of state between characters and even `LogPrint` calls as they could end up split upâbut escape codes seem to be the most common attack vector for terminals.)",
