   "body" : "Renaming the main thread (e.g., the one the program spawns with) causes the name of the daemon in utilities such as \"top\" to show as \"b-init\" instead of bitcoind. This is surprising, as it doesn't show the other thread names (by default), you'd expect it to show program names.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't only affect top: killall does no longer recognize the program name\r\n```\r\n$ killall bitcoind\r\nbitcoind: no process found\r\n$ killall b-init\r\n(no output, succesful)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn contrast to `bitcoin-qt`, which doesn't suffer from this problem because it has a separate init thread, initialization happens in the main thread in `bitcoind`, and it's renamed due to `util::ThreadRename(\"init\");` in `AppInit`. If we want to name the init thread, this should only be done in `bitcoin-qt`.\r\n\r\n(not sure when this was introduced, but #16984 made the issue more visible because ther's no bitcoin in the name anymore)",
