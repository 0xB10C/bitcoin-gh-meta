Because the\r\ncall to `MaybePunishNode()` in `PeerLogicValidation::BlockChecked()` only\r\npreviously happened if the REJECT code was > 0 and < `REJECT_INTERNAL`,\r\nthen there are cases were `MaybePunishNode()` can get called where it\r\nwasn't previously:\r\n\r\n- when `AcceptBlockHeader()` fails with `CACHED_INVALID`.\r\n- when `AcceptBlockHeader()` fails with `BLOCK_MISSING_PREV`.\r\n\r\nNote that `BlockChecked()` cannot fail with an 'internal' reject code. The\r\nonly internal reject code was `REJECT_HIGHFEE`, which was only set in\r\nATMP.",
