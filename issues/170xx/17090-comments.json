      "body" : "A number of comments:\r\n * Obviously my favorite path to rust in core right now is the \"make it easy to add new modules to download blocks/headers for anti-censorship\", which #16834 and #16762 obviously are first steps/demos of. I think its nice cause it is completely optional, both at build-time, and in the sense that we can have threads that are doing that crash (without bringing down the rest of Core due to panic catches) without it making the rest of Core broken.\r\n * I think we should air towards \"minimum version of the language we can get by with\" until we have a reason not to, and we can discuss it more then. Largely, I think #16834 is ready-to-go enough (mod review) that we can pretty much move forward with it without committing to a lot of these decisions today.\r\n * WRT cargo-vs-rustc: I don't see a lot of reason to use cargo. The major benefit it provides is downloading arbitrary code from github, building it, and linking it into your program. Obviously this isn't helpful for us, and we'll almost certainly subtree any dependencies we take, and I went and tested linking dependencies that are subtree'd without cargo and its just a few more flags to rustc.",
