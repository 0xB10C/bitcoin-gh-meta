This can result in doing a big headers sync with many (if not all) of our peers simultaneously, which wastes bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThis PR would reduce that overhead by picking (at most) one new peer to try syncing headers with whenever a new block is announced, prior to our headers chain being caught up.",
