For example, vector's move constructor guarantees the moved from object will be empty (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/vector).\r\n\r\nCurrently some things are failing in CI as jonatack pointed out:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e25b0c6838f375c810bee292ed49e13c9b5acc69/src/test/util_tests.cpp#L2495-L2497\r\n\r\nBut maybe we could work around these with a custom move function (`util::SafelyMoveFrom`?) that does the same as `std::move` but avoids triggering the error. Or, I wonder if something like `std::move(*&t2)` would trick the linter",
