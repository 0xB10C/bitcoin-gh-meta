   "body" : "Currently `ResendWalletTransactions` (used for normal rebroadcasts) will attempt to rebroadcast all of the transactions in the wallet in the order they are stored in `mapWallet`. This ends up being in in txid order. However `ReacceptWalletTransactions` (used for rebroadcast on loading) first sorts the txs by wallet insertion order, then broadcasts them. The result is that `ResendWalletTranactions` will fail to rebroadcast child transactions if their txids happen to be lexicographically less than their parent's txid This PR resolves this issue by refactoring `ReacceptWalletTransactions` sorting code into a separate function, then using that function in both `ReacceptWalletTransactions` and `ResendWalletTransactions` so that both functions will sort the transactions in the same order before processing for rebroadcast.\r\n\r\nA test has also been added that checks that such transaction chains are rebroadcast correctly.",
