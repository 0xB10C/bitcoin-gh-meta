   "body" : "The counter is an optimization over calling `ret.empty()`. It was\r\nsuggested that the compiler would realize `cnt` is only `0` on the first\r\niteration, and not actually emit the check and conditional.\r\n\r\nThis optimization was actually not triggered at all, since we\r\nincremented `cnt` at the beginning of the first iteration. Fix it by\r\nincrementing at the end instead.\r\n\r\nThis was reported by Github user \"Janus\".\r\n\r\nFixes #25682. Note this does *not* change semantics. It only allows the optimization of moving instead of copying on first `CScript` element to actually be reachable.",
