I don't think the benefits are worth the costs.\r\n\r\n(I realise this PR doesn't remove autotools, but AIUI that's the eventual intention.)\r\n\r\n>an opportunity to drop the build_msvc subdirectory from the repo altogether\r\n\r\nI don't see why CMake changes the situation around build_msvc. We could drop it today and tell Windows builders to use autotools just as well.\r\n\r\n>Also there is a non-technical/social benefit. Over time, the Autotools community shrinks, but CMake community grows. New contributors, who join this project in the future, will readily support a CMake-based system rather an Autotools-based one.\r\n\r\nDo you have evidence of this? Autotools is fairly standard, and mostly just standard sh and make stuff (and m4, but that's admittedly more of a downside). CMake breaks from the norm, and requires a domain-specific language.",
