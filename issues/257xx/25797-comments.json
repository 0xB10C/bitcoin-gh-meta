Even starting with some rationale from something like [\"Why CMake?\"](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Why%20CMake.html).\r\n\r\n> The plan is to have it in the repo shortly after branching 24.x off, and make CMake-based build system a drop-in replacement of Autotools-based one during the next 2 or 3 release cycles.\r\n\r\nConcept NACK on any approach that has as maintaining multiple build systems over multiple, or even a single release. That will be a maintainability / developer nightmare. If we are going to switch, we should just switch. CMake in, Autotools out, over a short period, ideally just after a branch off, so there is plenty of time for changes to settle and issues to be fixed before the next release.",
