But it also seemed unclear who is actually using the REST interface if I remember correctly. That made it hard to decide both if anyone is facing issues from the changes and even if it's actually worth making improvements at all.\r\n\r\nIs there a list of projects that are using the REST interface? I think that would be very helpful anyway, in order to collect targeted feedback from the actual users that these changes will affect.",
