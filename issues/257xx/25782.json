   "body" : "This PR adds missing test coverage for the `verifymessage` RPC, for the case that a non-P2PKH (but otherwise valid) address is passed:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e09ad284c762a79d59417389e9056c18e25d9770/src/util/message.cpp#L38-L40\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e09ad284c762a79d59417389e9056c18e25d9770/src/rpc/signmessage.cpp#L48-L49\r\nIn order to derive the public key, the test is changed to start with a bare (byte-encoded) private key as source instead of WIF-format. The resulting base58-strings for private key and address are asserted to the hardcoded ones to assure the behaviour is not changed. The passed addresses to trigger the error are of the types nested segwit (P2SH-P2WPKH) and native segwit (P2WPKH) and are created with the `key_to_p2...` helpers of the test framework. At some point in the future, if we have BIP322 support, all those will likely succeed and can then be moved from error-throwing to the succedding assert loop.",
