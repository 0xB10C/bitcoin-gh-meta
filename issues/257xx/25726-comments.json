It's always possible your download somehow got interrupted of course. Does the problem persist if you try to download again?\r\n\r\n> Workaround: you can use the 0.22 installer, then download the 0.23 zip and extract the executables from there to overwrite the existing EXE files (qt.exe in the main Program Files\\Bitcoin folder, other executables in the ZIP go to the \"daemon\" subfolder)\r\n\r\nThat shouldn't be necessary; you can directly use the executables from the zip file without needing another installation.",

Even when downloading large files from Taiwan (which is slow from France and may occasionally interrupt a TCP session in the middle, this is detected, and the download is resumable, never truncated silently).\r\n\r\nI've also tried using other web browsers on other OSes and machines (including tryuing to download directly with a dedicated service on my web router), and even on alternate Internet providers (e.g. on my mobile phone over a 4G or 5G connection), I get exactly the same early truncation of the EXE file than when using my fiber access. If I look at HTTP headers, there's seems to be an inconsistancy between when is reported as the available byteranges. Notealso that I do not use any external frontend cache using any large local store, so that cannot be the cause, and with whatever method, the final filesizes and recomputed hashes (MD5 + SH256) are always the same on all machines used (so this is not a transient problem).",

      "body" : "I found some related but obscure events in the Event Registry:\r\nApps & Services Logs > Windows > AppId > Operational\r\n\r\nThe app cannot be authenticatd with the embedded signatures.\r\n\r\n- Source: AppId; EventID: 4004\r\n  - AppID service was called to check the signature of \\?\\C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe.\r\nStatus Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xfffffffe.\r\n\r\nIt occurs after several error events like\r\n\r\n- Source: AppID; Id: 4008\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AiSvcVerifyFile called AiGetTrustedPublisherName, which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xfffffffe).\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AiGetTrustedPublisherName called AipGetFileSignature, which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xc0070490).\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AipGetFileSignature called CryptCATAdminEnumCatalogFromHash, which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xc0070490).\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AipGetFileSignature called WinVerifyTrust(WTD_CHOICE_FILE), which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0x800b0100 = MissingSignature). (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wintrust/nf-wintrust-winverifytrust and https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource/blob/master/System.Core/System/Security/Cryptography/SignatureVerificationResult.cs)\r\n\r\nSo this looks like the embedded Authenticode signatures in the installer.exe fails to be checked, and Windows blocks the execution. There are certificates present, but visibly some upstream PKI is not reachable by me from France (blocked by US export restrictions, or some failing internet links to check its authenticity or a certificate that has been blacklisted? or a root CA certificate missing in Windows for France? I've seen such issues with some SSL websites using some Oracle hosting services for their PKI, notably some which are used by advertizers, but blocked in the US-EU safe harbour agreement from being installed by default). The certicate chain in your EXE does not validate up to its trusted root, or there's a missing counterpart signature.\r\n\r\nBut more likely your developer certificate for trust (used for Authenticode) is expired (or has been revoked) and has not been renewed. Did you forget to pay a yearly billing to renew it before building it in May? Did you install the renewed certificate in your building environment? Did you forget to request some authorizations before signing your request and asking to your PKI provider to authenticate your signature? Did you update your \"mingw\" installation to get such certificate (if not, you can just self-sign your app for use on your own machine and it works because you have the private keys, but cannot distribute it so that it validates on other machines or in other countries than yours)?\r\n\r\nSo for now, the prebuilt installer.exe for v0.23 won't work. The only work around is to use the installer.exe from v0.22, then overwrite EXE files that are currently in the downloadable ZIP for v0.23 (when extracting them from the ZIP, Windows requests user permission as the signature does not seem trustable; probably the v0.23 installer.exe does the same, but does not have the builtin capability to ask permission to the user with a GUI dialog, and just fails instantly to extract and install anything; apparently it can just perform a basic CRC check but the Authenticode verifications for the extracted files are enforced now by Windows and such CRC check is just insufficient and unnecessary, even if it passes); or build them ourself using the sources and installing the mingw building environment (installing WSL if needed; note that I have WSL installed) to compile it for our own host (but not signing them publicly, or just self-signing them for our own local use no our machines with our personal certificates generated locally) not for redistribution on the Net.\r\n\r\nFor now your v0.23 installer.exe contains only a single self-signed signature, authenticating only a date/timestamp, not the authenticity of code; yes you publish an external SHA256 hash for the whole file (different from the embedded SHA256 hash used only to sign your timestamp, countersigned by your PKI provider), but it seems to be insufficient (for the code you just perform the basic check on CRC, but the intaller engine you use wants more and probably refuses to install any extracted EXE files without any kind of authentication when your signed timestamp comes after some timestamp limit that expired or was revoked for any use after some authenticated limit.",

      "body" : "Also I tried to compare PE/EXE headers (with \"dumpbin.exe filename\" from a command line prompt)  between the v0.22 and v0.23 EXE installers.\r\n\r\nThey show some differences:\r\n\r\n- The .text section is now shorter (size of raw data: 9000 hex in v0.22 vs. 8000 in v0.23)\r\n- All sections (.text, .data, .rdata, .xdata, .pdata, .bss, .idata, .ndata, .rsrc) have less flags (e.g. for \".text\", we got 60000020 hex, including two additional \"RESERVED - UNKNOWN\" flags in v0.22, where as v0.23 just has flags 60000020 hex, for \"Code\", and \"Execute Read\")\r\n- The virtual address of that section grows from 0000000000401000 to 000000000040908F in v.022, to 0000000140001000 to 0000000140008F9F in v0.23, by being offseted by 000000010000000\r\n\r\nAnd of course the size of the \"Certificates directory\" has grown (this is where you append the archived files to extract, in the padding left after your basic timestamp signature. Using such huge padding area without certifying with their own signatures is not really supported by Microsoft, and can cause the Authenticode loader of Windows to fail if it exhausts some internal limits; that padding area is only supported if it contains only zeroes. This may have worked with legacy installers, but not for such installer package that is now too big; it's likely that Authenticate expects to find a reasonable end of this padding area (which is not secured at all... that's why you need your custom CRC check for the whole file in the loader), or it may now exhaust the workign area permitted for custome loaders (and given that you'e reduced the .text area, the loader may not have enough virtual space allocated in memory to process the archived contents stored in the certificates directory, notably if it wants to decompress it, or you may need to increase the declared sizes for the BSS, stack reserve, or heap reserve, or their initial committed sizes that are quite small (4KB), notably if the new files require larger lookup window size for some LempelZiv-like or deflate decompression.\r\n\r\nSome other changes are also related to the build tool change (notably the linker version from 2.34 to 2.37, installed with the Windows SDK or updated by Windows update for recent builds). In the installer EXE v20.22 there was an additional characteristic in the main header, indicating that relocations were stripped (no longer the case, so addresse randomization may no longer work, and Windows now no longer wants to execute programs with non randomized virtual addresses).\r\n\r\nIf you upgraded your build chain (may be not mingw itself, used to compile the provided BT tools, but the chain used to build the installer), you may need to add additional flags for using the new linker.\r\n\r\nAnd may be your existing install engine tool (NSIS?) you used no longer works with updated linkers from the Windows SDK, or needs to be updated too to support new restrictions applied with this newer linker.",

The relocation stripping would have been a cause of ASLR not working correctly, as a reloc section is required by Windows for working ASLR. This is something we fixed explictly, see #18702, and related discussion in https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19011 etc.",
