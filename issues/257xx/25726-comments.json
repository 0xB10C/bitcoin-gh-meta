It's always possible your download somehow got interrupted of course. Does the problem persist if you try to download again?\r\n\r\n> Workaround: you can use the 0.22 installer, then download the 0.23 zip and extract the executables from there to overwrite the existing EXE files (qt.exe in the main Program Files\\Bitcoin folder, other executables in the ZIP go to the \"daemon\" subfolder)\r\n\r\nThat shouldn't be necessary; you can directly use the executables from the zip file without needing another installation.",

Even when downloading large files from Taiwan (which is slow from France and may occasionally interrupt a TCP session in the middle, this is detected, and the download is resumable, never truncated silently).\r\n\r\nI've also tried using other web browsers on other OSes and machines (including tryuing to download directly with a dedicated service on my web router), and even on alternate Internet providers (e.g. on my mobile phone over a 4G or 5G connection), I get exactly the same early truncation of the EXE file than when using my fiber access. If I look at HTTP headers, there's seems to be an inconsistancy between when is reported as the available byteranges. Notealso that I do not use any external frontend cache using any large local store, so that cannot be the cause, and with whatever method, the final filesizes and recomputed hashes (MD5 + SH256) are always the same on all machines used (so this is not a transient problem).",

      "body" : "I found some related but obscure events in the Event Registry:\r\nApps & Services Logs > Windows > AppId > Operational\r\n\r\nThe app cannot be authenticatd with the embedded signatures.\r\n\r\n- Source: AppId; EventID: 4004\r\n  - AppID service was called to check the signature of \\?\\C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe.\r\nStatus Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xfffffffe.\r\n\r\nIt occurs after several error events like\r\n\r\n- Source: AppID; Id: 4008\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AiSvcVerifyFile called AiGetTrustedPublisherName, which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xfffffffe).\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AiGetTrustedPublisherName called AipGetFileSignature, which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xc0070490).\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AipGetFileSignature called CryptCATAdminEnumCatalogFromHash, which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0xc0070490).\r\n  - Error calling fonction: AipGetFileSignature called WinVerifyTrust(WTD_CHOICE_FILE), which could not be returned (Error code: Unknown NTSTATUS Error code: 0x800b0100 = MissingSignature). (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wintrust/nf-wintrust-winverifytrust and https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource/blob/master/System.Core/System/Security/Cryptography/SignatureVerificationResult.cs)\r\n\r\nSo this looks like the embedded Authenticode signatures in the installer.exe fails to be checked, and Windows blocks the execution. There are certificates present, but visibly some upstream PKI is not reachable by me from France (blocked by US export restrictions, or some failing internet links to check its authenticity or a certificate that has been blacklisted? or a root CA certificate missing in Windows for France? I've seen such issues with some SSL websites using some Oracle hosting services for their PKI, notably some which are used by advertizers, but blocked in the US-EU safe harbour agreement from being installed by default). The certicate chain in your EXE does not validate up to its trusted root, or there's a missing counterpart signature.\r\n\r\nBut more likely your developer certificate for trust (used for Authenticode) is expired (or has been revoked) and has not been renewed. Did you forget to pay a yearly billing to renew it before building it in May? Did you install the renewed certificate in your building environment? Did you forget to request some authorizations before signing your request and asking to your PKI provider to authenticate your signature? Did you update your \"mingw\" installation to get such certificate (if not, you can just self-sign your app for use on your own machine and it works because you have the private keys, but cannot distribute it so that it validates on other machines or in other countries than yours)?\r\n\r\nSo for now, the prebuilt installer.exe for v0.23 won't work. The only work around is to use the installer.exe from v0.22, then overwrite EXE files that are currently in the downloadable ZIP for v0.23 (when extracting them from the ZIP, Windows requests user permission as the signature does not seem trustable; probably the v0.23 installer.exe does the same, but does not have the builtin capability to ask permission to the user with a GUI dialog, and just fails instantly to extract and install anything; apparently it can just perform a basic CRC check but the Authenticode verifications for the extracted files are enforced now by Windows and such CRC check is just insufficient and unnecessary, even if it passes); or build them ourself using the sources and installing the mingw building environment (installing WSL if needed; note that I have WSL installed) to compile it for our own host (but not signing them publicly, or just self-signing them for our own local use no our machines with our personal certificates generated locally) not for redistribution on the Net.\r\n\r\nFor now your v0.23 installer.exe contains only a single self-signed signature, authenticating only a date/timestamp, not the authenticity of code; yes you publish an external SHA256 hash for the whole file (different from the embedded SHA256 hash used only to sign your timestamp, countersigned by your PKI provider), but it seems to be insufficient (for the code you just perform the basic check on CRC, but the intaller engine you use wants more and probably refuses to install any extracted EXE files without any kind of authentication when your signed timestamp comes after some timestamp limit that expired or was revoked for any use after some authenticated limit.",

      "body" : "Also I tried to compare PE/EXE headers (with \"dumpbin.exe filename\" from a command line prompt)  between the v0.22 and v0.23 EXE installers.\r\n\r\nThey show some differences:\r\n\r\n- The .text section is now shorter (size of raw data: 9000 hex in v0.22 vs. 8000 in v0.23)\r\n- All sections (.text, .data, .rdata, .xdata, .pdata, .bss, .idata, .ndata, .rsrc) have less flags (e.g. for \".text\", we got 60000020 hex, including two additional \"RESERVED - UNKNOWN\" flags in v0.22, where as v0.23 just has flags 60000020 hex, for \"Code\", and \"Execute Read\")\r\n- The virtual address of that section grows from 0000000000401000 to 000000000040908F in v.022, to 0000000140001000 to 0000000140008F9F in v0.23, by being offseted by 000000010000000\r\n\r\nAnd of course the size of the \"Certificates directory\" has grown (this is where you append the archived files to extract, in the padding left after your basic timestamp signature. Using such huge padding area without certifying with their own signatures is not really supported by Microsoft, and can cause the Authenticode loader of Windows to fail if it exhausts some internal limits; that padding area is only supported if it contains only zeroes. This may have worked with legacy installers, but not for such installer package that is now too big; it's likely that Authenticate expects to find a reasonable end of this padding area (which is not secured at all... that's why you need your custom CRC check for the whole file in the loader), or it may now exhaust the workign area permitted for custome loaders (and given that you'e reduced the .text area, the loader may not have enough virtual space allocated in memory to process the archived contents stored in the certificates directory, notably if it wants to decompress it, or you may need to increase the declared sizes for the BSS, stack reserve, or heap reserve, or their initial committed sizes that are quite small (4KB), notably if the new files require larger lookup window size for some LempelZiv-like or deflate decompression.\r\n\r\nSome other changes are also related to the build tool change (notably the linker version from 2.34 to 2.37, installed with the Windows SDK or updated by Windows update for recent builds). In the installer EXE v20.22 there was an additional characteristic in the main header, indicating that relocations were stripped (no longer the case, so addresse randomization may no longer work, and Windows now no longer wants to execute programs with non randomized virtual addresses).\r\n\r\nIf you upgraded your build chain (may be not mingw itself, used to compile the provided BT tools, but the chain used to build the installer), you may need to add additional flags for using the new linker.\r\n\r\nAnd may be your existing install engine tool (NSIS?) you used no longer works with updated linkers from the Windows SDK, or needs to be updated too to support new restrictions applied with this newer linker.",

      "body" : "Of course Windows can connect on the Internet (and I'm writing here from the same machine with the same OS, Windows 11).\r\nIf something fails, that's most probably because the new installer.EXE file was effectively built using a different linker version, and Windows 11 may assume that with this version it enforces new security restrictions (notably for Authenticode checks).\r\n(and this is independant of how the EXE files appended and archives at end of the initial part of the installer EXE are built themselves. As the new embedded EXE files archived there, in the area normally reserved only for adding signatures, have grown in size, it seems that the new linker version used in the premiary part has reached an upper limit on ho far it can process that area, so it most likely cannot even make its own CRC compaution of that area, which is not signed by itself.\r\nIn 2013, Microsoft instructed developers to NOT use that area except for storing signatures, and so most probably the new linker used in the main part of that file makes such assumption. As a result the problem cannot load at all (and I've tried to load it on various versions of Windows, it lever loads).\r\n\r\nYou probably need to check again the NSIS or script that you used to build that installer EXE file. Something has changed in your buildchain (but it is not visible in the sources we can see here).\r\n\r\nFor now the only workaround is to use the former installer for v0.22 (to setup some registry value or icons in start menus), then overwrite all the installed directory (created in \"C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\") to replace it with those coming in the new v0.23 ZIP file. But the v0.23 installer EXE does not run at all (except possibly on the machine where it was built, due to some local developer tweaks, or because of its local Internet setttings, such as for DNS, or firewalls, or local caches in their local routers, or there's a dependency to have an authorized link to some PKI provider that is not reachable/not routable from elsewhere).\r\n\r\nNote that I use other softwares that are using installers also based on the NSIS installer engine, they have no problem.\r\nBut even trying to load that installer EXE v0.23 with a debugger fails: we get the error message above before we can attach the debugger to the loaded image (and that loading program failure is reported to Microsoft vis its own telemetry systems, but we get no diagnostic at all and no return from Microsoft, most probably because this installer in just incompatible with Windows requirements; it's not a valid EXE image).\r\n\r\nSo you probably need to check how your NSIS building tools are installed (if it was upgraded, the current \"share/setup.nsi.in\"  script may need other tunings to make it work with the new version, notably those related to security, or minimal section sizes needed to run your very basic CRC check in the embedded custom loader function: I see that one section ni your new v0.23 installer is smaller than the previous version, it has been reduced by 4KiB and the Windows linker used has changed as well). Anyway this CRC check (now enforced by https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b3ccf26df47c70e7559625a0e65205648f64efb7) is really too basic, in fact completely futile, to be really useful against malware injections in the archive part appended in the padding area at end of the EXE. It should better use SHA256.\r\n\r\nWith CRC32, you can still inject arbitrary files, plus a dummy file with 4 null bytes, compute the new CRC, and complement the result to set these 4 bytes and it will pass this check; this requires jsut a few nanoseconds; it will be much more difficult if you use a strong hash like SHA256 because it requires finding a collision by some brute force, even if there are some accelerations. For example the new tools now use an extra DLL (bitcoin tools are no longer completely staticalyl linked), which is located on another directory, but which may be easily defeated by injecting another DLL (with the same name) which will be placed in the \"bin/\" subdirectory: run the unmodified tools, and that injected malware DLL will be loaded when the tools will start running (those tools as well do not perform any self-consistancy check in their own loaders, given that they are also not securely signed individually as well!).\r\n\r\nAnd that area should not just contain an archive of EXE files to install, but also a signed catalog listing files to be extracted, instead of blindly installing every file that may be appended in that padding area (meaning that this installer is still not safe at all, so that I don't think that this is a Windows bug but a very useful feature if Windows refuses to load it).\r\n\r\nOr may be it will only run if we change advanced security settigns in Windows (such as \"image randomization\" or the \"real-time protection\", or \"cloud-based security\", or \"virtual-based security\": did you turn them off and did not used their default settings for Windows?) Note that Microsoft is constantly adjusting its own \"Windows Defender\" settings, and I'm running also n a machine where \"Advanced Windows Defender\" is on (and I cannot disable it at all), and there are a few other security settings enforced by MDM and Intune management, against the injection of malwares.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I would urge you to instruct users to NEVER use your advertized \"upgrade\", notably those that have a local installation with their personal wallets (all currency contents could be stolen instantly by the injected malware, or the malware could severely impact the P2P Bitcoin network by performing DDoS attacks, to facilitate attacks against large wallet holders or Bitcoin currency exchanges, or to take control of that network, by injecting large falsified chains and taking control of it, ruining many Bitcoin currency holders, if there are enough corrupted installations of Bitcoin tools acting together to gain the consensus; note that the new DLL in v0.23 is exactly made for that: controling the consensus!).\r\n\r\nSo for now I consider v0.23 really unsafe (with its DLL); only v0.22 is (moderately) safe (but it can still be easily compromized to steal local wallets, if they are not managed by a trusted external wallet service so that local wallets contain only 0.00BTC all the time, or are left completely unused).\r\n\r\nUsing the \"CRCCheck\" feature of NSIS is not a security measure; it's just a basic consistancy check. It cannot replace a proper \"Authenticode\" signature, but if you use the latter, then \"CRCCheck=force\" is futile, and should even be \"CRCCheck=off\"!\r\n\r\nGiven the amount of BTC money that a Bitcoin Core can control, I don't think it is reasonable to not securely sign it (on Windows with authenticode, or on Linux with catalogs in safe repositories, but always with cryptographically string signatures, at least SHA2-256, but now SHA2-512, or maybe SHA3-256...SHA3-512 if the target system supports the SHA3 algorithms and you don't provide an installable implementation); taking some small time to compute a strong hsh on any program installation is a requirement, independantly of what that program will then do; that time occurs only once during the installation or upgrade. As well, the installer can create a self-signature without modifying the file if that signature is stored in a separate catalog, or inserted in a \"stream\" (when the EXE file is stored on a NTFS or ReFS volume).",

Then download your v0.23 installer EXE and try running it (using the v0.22 installer.exe works without any problem). Such VM (in a shared machine) will also allow testing it in the most security-restricted situations (however these VM are known to run on the best and latest CPU models; you may have to choose which kind of CPU you'll get, I always used an Intel Core x64, and did not test with AMD).\r\n\r\nYou could do that as well on other VM hosting providers which allow installing Windows desktop OSes, and using it with some RDP client.",

If you see the error dialog above, you see the problem: Windows does not accept it as a valid executable.\r\n\r\nBut now you'll need to use Windows debuggers: your VM may need to have developer tools installed, including Mingw running  a VM inside a VM to compile it, so your basic test VM may require some additional storage; but you should be able to use developer tools on your own PC, and use \"remote debugging\" to deploy and test the installer inside the Azure VM (this requires Windows development skills and knowledge about how to use NSIS, so that a basic user will not know how to do that; and your Azure VM must then be at least running Windows 7, but likely Windows 10, as Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 are in end of life and may not run in free test VMs on shared Azure machines).\r\n",

      "body" : "> I was reading different threads on stackoverflow, microsoft answers etc. with this error `0xc000007B` and was able to almost reproduce the issue. This can be tried irrespective of country, network etc. I do not get this error but v23.0 exe file doesn't work whereas v22.0 works:\r\n> \r\n>     1. Go to: Windows Security -> App & Browser Control -> Exploit protection -> System Settings -> Force randomization for images should be ON\r\n> \r\n>     2. Restart machine\r\n> \r\n>     3. Download v23.0, v22.0 for bitcoin core and try to run both\r\n\r\nI believe this replicates the issue. I also do not see an error dialog, but in the event viewer under Windows Logs > System, I do see an event for the binary with the expected error message. The issue also occurs with the unsigned installer, so this is not an issue with the signature, but probably with NSIS.",
