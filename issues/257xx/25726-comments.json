It's always possible your download somehow got interrupted of course. Does the problem persist if you try to download again?\r\n\r\n> Workaround: you can use the 0.22 installer, then download the 0.23 zip and extract the executables from there to overwrite the existing EXE files (qt.exe in the main Program Files\\Bitcoin folder, other executables in the ZIP go to the \"daemon\" subfolder)\r\n\r\nThat shouldn't be necessary; you can directly use the executables from the zip file without needing another installation.",
