It's always possible your download somehow got interrupted of course. Does the problem persist if you try to download again?\r\n\r\n> Workaround: you can use the 0.22 installer, then download the 0.23 zip and extract the executables from there to overwrite the existing EXE files (qt.exe in the main Program Files\\Bitcoin folder, other executables in the ZIP go to the \"daemon\" subfolder)\r\n\r\nThat shouldn't be necessary; you can directly use the executables from the zip file without needing another installation.",

Even when downloading large files from Taiwan (which is slow from France and may occasionally interrupt a TCP session in the middle, this is detected, and the download is resumable, never truncated silently).\r\n\r\nI've also tried using other web browsers on other OSes and machines (including tryuing to download directly with a dedicated service on my web router), and even on alternate Internet providers (e.g. on my mobile phone over a 4G or 5G connection), I get exactly the same early truncation of the EXE file than when using my fiber access. If I look at HTTP headers, there's seems to be an inconsistancy between when is reported as the available byteranges. Notealso that I do not use any external frontend cache using any large local store, so that cannot be the cause, and with whatever method, the final filesizes and recomputed hashes (MD5 + SH256) are always the same on all machines used (so this is not a transient problem).",

Windows reports an error 0xc000007B in a dialog just asking to press OK to terminate.\r\n\r\nThis is most likely incorrectly linked with the Visual C++ runtime libraries, or assumes that we have exactly the same libraries on Windows (I also tried to locate redistributable VC++ Runtime libraries updates on Microsoft.com site, they saif they were not needed because my system was up to date and had all the necessary versions ).\r\n\r\nIt's very liklely that your builder used unsafe version of these libraries, or versions that are not redistributable and noly safe for your local installation or when using statically linked libraries, or that you mixed 32bit and 64bits libraries and the program will run only on 32 bit systems.\r\n\r\n",
