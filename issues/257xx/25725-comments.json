      "body" : "Concept ACK. I always tested the previous PR with this patch on top of it.\r\n\r\nNo longer needs to be draft.\r\n\r\nI suggest holding off merge until after the v24 branch-off, perhaps a bit longer. We should give people a chance to come up with attacks that are still possible after #25717, yet are somehow thwarted by checkpoints. Also, if we find a structural problem with that PR and have to revert it, I'd rather not give CNN the headline \"Bitcoin Core brings back checkpoints\".\r\n\r\n@michaelfolkson I think dropping checkpoints is in the same category as retroactively applying soft forks from genesis. With checkpoints an attacker can \"only\" wipe out eight years of transaction history (the last checkpoint is from 2014). Without checkpoints they can wipe out thirteen years. Those who run an older client will be \"saved\" in the case of the latter attack. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, if the attacker violates P2SH rules before block 173,805 (see #11739) they would previously be rejected by all nodes, just based on headers, because that's _before_ the most recent checkpoint. With this PR the blocks would be rejected based on violating P2SH rules. That's still not the deepest burried soft-fork, that honor either goes to the 1MB limit (which Satoshi buried in 172f006020965ae8763a0610845c051ed1e3b522 almost immediately after introducing it) or something older.\r\n\r\nNote that the changes in #25717 do not prevent such a massive reorg: as long as the headers have valid proof-of-work, they'll get processed.",
