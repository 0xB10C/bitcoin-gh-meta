(And our starting point for those syncs will be further behind, because we don't make progress on adding headers to our block index until phase 2.)\r\n\r\nI opened #25720 as a mitigation for this effect; many strategies are possible and I think they are orthogonal to the change proposed here, so I'd prefer to leave the discussion of this particular issue to that PR.",
