      "body" : "It's worth pointing out that initial headers sync will be slowed down by this PR, not just because we will download headers twice before storing, but also because the additional latency to make progress on syncing with our initial headers-sync-peer will mean that we're more likely to receive a block announcement while waiting for headers sync to finish, which in turn will trigger a headers sync with all our peers that announce the block. (And our starting point for those syncs will be further behind, because we don't make progress on adding headers to our block index until phase 2.)\r\n\r\nI opened #25720 as a mitigation for this effect; many strategies are possible and I think they are orthogonal to the change proposed here, so I'd prefer to leave the discussion of this particular issue to that PR.",
