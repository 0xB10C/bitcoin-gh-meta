It'd be good to disentangle any logic/state in our net_processing code that has tight coupling between the two.~\r\n\r\n~The root cause here seems to be that the block download timeout is way too long in most cases, and should be significantly reduced once the node is out of initial sync and at the tip. That timeout isn't specific to compact blocks and could be reduced for all block downloads.~\r\n\r\nEDIT: I meant to leave this comment on #22307.",
