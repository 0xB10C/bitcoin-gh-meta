      "body" : "> This looks like some benign plumbing for capnpnp IPC. I tried looking ahead at the parent PR ([#10102 (files)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102/files#diff-ab470dae240c184802de8bbc39f63116f54c11e2dff50ef90421aecc50b04284)) but I have to admit I can't totally tell where or how this `Context` is being used. Maybe some additional details from @ryanofsky would help here. But there's nothing obviously wrong with (or even complicated about) this changeset.\r\n\r\nThanks these structs which are empty for now just get used in commit 2516d397d54b021e37d6e7628655fe7c54d2fb06 \"Make bitcoin-gui spawn a bitcoin-node process\" from #10102:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2516d397d54b021e37d6e7628655fe7c54d2fb06/src/ipc/context.h\r\n- https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2516d397d54b021e37d6e7628655fe7c54d2fb06/src/ipc/capnp/context.h\r\n\r\nIn that commit the context structs just get some function pointer members added so init code can hook into different multiprocess events. So for example with GUI and node code running in different processes, random number seed and logging init code has to run twice instead of once during startup (because it has to run once in each process) so `ipc::Context` gets an `init_process` callback to handle the initialization transparently in the multiprocess case, and bitcoin-qt and bitcoind code doesn't have to change in the single process case.",
