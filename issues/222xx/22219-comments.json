      "body" : "re: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22219#discussion_r666378196\r\n\r\nThanks for experimenting with this!\r\n\r\n> What's the rational of having an interfaces maker such as `makeEcho` supported on `BitcoindInit`, `bitcoind` program should never be executed as a spawned process/`IpcServer` ?\r\n\r\nJust like all interfaces in the `src/interfaces/` directory, the `interfaces::Init` interface can be used remotely or it can be used locally. `bitcoind` provides the `interfaces::Chain` interface and it uses the `interface::WalletClient` interface even though it does not support IPC at all. `bitcoin-qt` uses the `interfaces::Node` and `interfaces::Wallet` interfaces even though it does not support IPC at all.\r\n\r\nThe `interfaces::Init` interface is just the starting interface. When a bitcoin process is created, whether or not uses IPC it can create an instance of the `interfaces::Init` interface and use it to get access to other interfaces supported by the process. If the current process like `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` and `bitcoin-node` has node code linked in, then `makeNode()` and `makeChain()` methods will return non-null. If the current process like `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` and `bitcoin-wallet` has wallet code linked in, then `makeWalletClient` will return non-null. If the current process like `bitcoin-gui` has none of these things linked in then all of these methods will return null.\r\n\r\nThe point of the Init interface is to allow the same bitcoin init code to be linked into different binaries and work without having to use preprocessor conditions or other build tricks. `make*` methods just return non-null if the relevant interface implementation is linked in and null if trying to instantiate the interface would cause link errors.\r\n\r\nEverything described above is happens with or without IPC. IPC just adds the option of calling other `interface::Init` instances that aren't in the current process. You can spawn a new process and call its Init methods. Or you can connect to an existing process through a socket can call its Init methods. Or you can create a socket and let other processes call your process's Init methods.\r\n\r\n> One option is to tread this as a throw returned to the client, as `MakeWalletClient` is providing, though it means anytime we add a new derived Init interface, we need to add throw stub in all other programs non-supporting the interface functionality ?\r\n\r\nI'm not clear what this would be trying to do. Is it is related to the bug described below? Returning does null seems more ergonomic than throwing an exception. libmultiprocess does support throwing & catching exceptions remotely, but it requires an extra annotation in capnp interface definitions.\r\n\r\n> Currently, if the interface maker isn't implemented-side, what I can observe on one of my local branch is silent failure of the IPC server, followed by a socket disconnection/`EventLoop` exit.\r\n\r\nThis isn't expected and sounds like a bug. Can you post a branch or commit hash with the code? I think there should never be much reason to call a `make` method in a remote process if you know it will return null. But if it does return null you should just see a null return value forwarded. It shouldn't cause the remote process to exit.\r\n\r\nThe log is a little strange, and I'm not sure how to interpret it without looking at the code (it might also help to see the client side log). It looks like the server is successfully returning null from a remote `makeEcho` request. But then the socket is disconnected and it exits. Maybe the socket is closing because the client is segfaulting?\r\n\r\nWould be great to post details in new issue (https://github.com/chaincodelabs/libmultiprocess/issues/new) since that issue tracker is a convenient place to collect feedback and provide support for these things.",
