   "body" : "This implements submission of packages to mempool + validation logic for fee-bumping transactions using CPFP within a package. This does not implement package relay. It adds a `submitrawpackage` RPC which is regtest-only because there are a handful of limitations (see \"Limitations\" below) that I believe make it unsafe to use on mainnet until we implement additional functionality. Afterward, I think we'll be ready to define a P2P protocol for deciding and communicating when to use package validation.\r\n\r\n**Status of this PR**:\r\nThis builds on #21800 (please review that first). I'm looking for approach feedback, additions to the list of limitations, and test case ideas. It's highly likely that I will break this PR up into smaller ones for easier review.\r\n\r\n**Limitations**:\r\n- Mainly: until package relay exists, fee-bumped package transactions that are otherwise too-low-fee won't go any further than the user's mempool. I think it would be misleading for them to see a successful `submitrawpackage()` result.\r\n- A package will be rejected if one of the transactions is already in the mempool. (#22252 or something similar)\r\n- A package will be rejected if one of the transactions has the same txid but different witness from a tx in the mempool. (#22253 but also, to avoid a pinning vector, I believe we may need something like #19645)\r\n- It still needs a `maxfeerate` check to protect users against absurdly overshooting when they're trying to fee bump the transaction. (We'd use ancestor feerate for this).\r\n- Other things that will pop into my head in the next few weeks while I'm trying to sleep.",
