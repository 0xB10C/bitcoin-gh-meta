      "body" : "Concept NACK. At least for now.\r\n\r\nFirstly, package trimming might be handled at the p2p-layer instead of the mempool acceptance one. I believe we have not decided yet on a package-announcement protocol, one of the solution could be something INV(\"utxo:feerate\")-based, which would assume the exact feerate package is evaluated by the receiver (or discarded from fetching is inferior to the best known in-mempool package for this utxo). Another solution could be to announce package_ids or another one could be to announce the raw serie of transaction identifier corresponding to a package.\r\n\r\nSecondly, i don't think this policy complexity is required for a v0.1 package-relay aiming to solve the pre-signed feerate problem for L2s. If the root transaction is already in the mempool, it doesn't offer a benefit for those protocols to reevaluate a later-received proposal. The package can still be bumped as a CPFP, not need to swallow additional complexity on our side.\r\n\r\nThirdly, i think this opens a new pinning vector (though not for LN use-case) in the case of the in-mempool same-txid-different-wtxid's feerate is far-lower than the same-txid-different-wtxid inside the package candidate. E.g Alice might expected to have pre-signed transaction with a feerate of 10 sat/vbyte and a CPFP of 20 sat/vbyte. Malicia has previously broadcast the pre-signed transaction, with a different witness, offering a feerate of 5 sat/vbyte ?",
