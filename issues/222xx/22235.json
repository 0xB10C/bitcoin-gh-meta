   "body" : "create a script for parsing the output from `bitcoind --help` to create an example conf file for new users. this PR is ready to merge when:\r\n\r\n- [x] create script (proof of concept)\r\n- [ ] lint script to fix ci failures\r\n- [ ] ensure script is portable across different operating systems\r\n\r\n## problem\r\n\r\nper #10746 , `bitcoin.conf` not being put into the data directory during installation causes some confusion for users when running bitcoin. more details in the issue\r\n\r\n## solution\r\n\r\nsince its non-trivial to generate and put it directly into the data directory during install, a simpler proposal was to create an example `bitcoin.conf` file in `share/examples` and instruct users to copy it to their data directory if would like to customize the options via the config file. however, since the command line and `bitcoin.conf` file are meant to be one to one, it's not ideal to have two sources of truth on what options are available. instead, we can use the option help from `bitcoind` as the source of truth and generating the file from that using a script. this was suggested in #10746 \r\n\r\nthis is an attempt to do that by running a shell script during `make install` which parses the output of `bitcoind --help` into `share/examples/bitcoin.conf`\r\n\r\nit is then up to the user to edit the file and copy it into their data directory (dependent on their operating system).\r\n\r\n## special considerations\r\n\r\nthis does re-write the current `share/examples/bitcoin.conf` which seemed to have extra info about the parameters. rather than keeping both files, i suggest having the one auto-generated file and any documentation about using options should be moved into `init.cpp`\r\n\r\ni also edited `init.cpp` to have the option help indicate that `-conf` is not usable from the config file. this is similar to how `-includeconf` 's help indicates it cannot be used from the command line\r\n",
