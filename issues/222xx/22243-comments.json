So there might be a rare-but-possible race between the asyncio threads receiving messages / updating the value & the test logic reading from the value. \r\n\r\nI'll open a PR with the fix. I currently have a commit in #21528 to refactor this test, I'm going to pull it out into a standalone PR with the additional locking. ",
