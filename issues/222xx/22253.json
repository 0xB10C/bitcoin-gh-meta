   "body" : "This is a prerequisite for some package mempool accept stuff, but can be reviewed independently.\r\n\r\nOn master, if you submit a transaction with the same txid but different witness to the mempool, it thinks the transactions are the same. Users submitting through `BroadcastTransaction()` (i.e. `sendrawtransaction` or the wallet) don't get notified that there's a different transaction in the mempool, although it doesn't crash. Users submitting through `testmempoolaccept()` will get a \"txn-already-in-mempool\" error.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply distinguishes between `txn-already-in-mempool` and `txn-same-nonwitness-data-in-mempool`, without handling them differently: `sendrawtransaction` still will not throw, but `testmempoolaccept` will give you a different error.\r\n\r\nMore Motivation:\r\n- I believe the intention of #19645 is to allow full swaps of transactions that have different witnesses but identical nonwitness data. Returning a different error message was suggested: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19645#issuecomment-705109193\r\n- This unblocks #22252, which detects when a package transaction (by txid) already exists in the mempool.",
