I guess it requires a good amount of review since there are some cases where there are discrepancies between string formats. Iâll trying running flynt and diffing it against this PR to see that in the next day or so, and give this some more review. I may also trying diffing test logs before/after these changes. Will get back after that. Any thoughts on squashing commits?",
