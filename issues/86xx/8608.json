   "body" : "This adds a new option `--enable-man` to configure, so manpages can be installed via `make install`.\r\nThis option defaults to yes, but opt out of the manpage installation is possible by running `./configure --disable-man` (or `--enable-man=no`) \r\n\r\nAs the license situation of the contrib/debian manpages is that most of them are GPL it was not 100% clear if they can be included here, also they are incomplete anyway so I let `help2man` create a few manpages from the 0.13.0 binaries and included them.\r\n\r\nThe script used to generate them has also been added to contrib/devtools.\r\n\r\nThis targets #7626 but was also briefly discussed in #8568",
