In my code for https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8464 I have also removed boost::thread and interruption points, preferring more explicit quitting. Dealing with the interruption code made working on #8464  more difficult than it had to be.\r\n\r\nOne Nit, which I think is worth addressing. I would refactor the names from Interrupt to Quit, Shutdown, or even ControlledExit. Connotation of interrupt is a non-consensual break, whereas Quit or Shutdown implies being done as a normal part of control flow.",
