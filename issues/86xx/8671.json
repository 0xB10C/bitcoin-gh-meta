   "body" : "Tests are really slow because of BOOST_CHECK doing a lot of unnecessary things in wine, BOOST_CHECK can't just be ripped out because some people rely on certain features for there dev process.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a more permanent fix, this PR minimally modifies PrevectorTests to use a local check. To make sure this local check isn't useless, it gets the seeds from the insecure random to allow tests to be repeated.\r\n\r\nThis should be an easy to merge PR; discussion about generally improving the unit test performance/framework beyond this can go here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8670",
