   "body" : "This allows running with multiple -wallet options to load more than one wallet.\r\n\r\n~~GUI has independent comboboxen for the main GUI window and debug console to select which wallet to view/use. The comboboxes are not visible in the main GUI unless multiple wallets are loaded (the debug window's combobox is useful even for a single wallet, since it allows selecting \"(none)\" to block wallet access).~~\r\n\r\n~~RPC can access only one wallet per user, but rpcauth is extended to accept a 4th field which controls which wallet, if any, the user has access to. I chose to do it this way because pre-multiwallet nodes will gracefully ignore such rpcauth rather than expose their wallet. The field can also be a single hyphen to block wallet access.~~\r\n\r\n(RPC and GUI changes are moved to my `multiwallet_rpc` and `multiwallet_gui` branches)",
