The blocks were sitting on an SSD. Bitcoin Core ran inside of a VM.\r\n\r\nThe REST API is helpful and might be enough for some but if you really want high speed access there's no substitute for the blk* files right now.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about my API proposal of exposing the block positions through the JSON API?",
