I'm a premature pusher it seems :-s\r\n\r\nAlso, as soon as I am happy with my code, I want to push it to my github account, but if I do that while the pull is closed, then I'm unable to re-open it, so I have to open it before pushing. But if I leave it open, other developers on github complain if it's not read enough, which sometime it isn't, so I close it until I am sure.\r\n\r\nIf there is a better way to do this, please let me know. The opening and closing seems to be due to a feature in github which locks the pull closed if pushes are done while it is closed :-s",
