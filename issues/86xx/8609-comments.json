Are issues only issues as long as you personally understand them?\r\n\r\nLook at the graph half-way through - there is still a minimum relay fee even though the memory utilization is almost zero. This is the issue - why limit the txs at all when the utilization is almost 0%? Would it not make more sense to continue storing txs and only increase the restrictive criteria once utilization gets close to being 100%?",

      "body" : "@rebroad One design goal of the limited mempool was to prevent relay of\ntransactions that don't pay for relay.\n\nConsider the following scenario: a peer figures out what the lowest feerate\nof any transaction in your mempool is (call it tx A), and creates a valid\ntransaction with a feerate 1sat/kB than this (call it tx B). If our mempool\nis at its maximum size, and there was no minimum feerate at all, we would\nkick out tx A and accept tx B, effectively replacing it. If this were to\nhappen across the network (for example because there are several nodes with\nthe same mempool size and software), the network as a whole would have\nrelayed tx A without it actually ending up in a block - it effectively\nrelayed across the network for free.\n\nThis could be exploited by anyone who observes the network wide behaviour,\nand produces a series of transactions with very very slowly increasing fee\nonly, which at every node in the network cause the previous transaction to\nbe replaced by the newer one, for effectively ~zero cost. At a large scale,\nthis means someone could use the P2P network to mass relay data everywhere,\nwasting bandwidth and processing time, without paying fees as a deterrent.\n\nTo combat this:\n* There always is a minimum feerate that we demand transactions pay\n(1000/kB currently, far lower than the going network rate, and the same as\nmany versions ago).\n* When a transaction is being kicked out in favor of another transaction\n(whether through RBF or mempool limiting), we always require the feerate of\nthe new one to pay at least the minimum feerate *more* than the kicked-out\none paid. This guarantees that the latest transaction in a chain of\nreplacements always paid for the relay (at minimum feerate level) of all\nprevious evicted transactions before it.\n* After kicking out a transaction, we raise the effective minimum feerate\ntemporarily to avoid using the newly available space (after a new block was\nmined) from being filled with relatively low-feerate transactions that\nnecessitate being evicted again soon after anyway.\n\nAs you can see, for all of these countermeasures, we need an effective\nminimum feerate even when the mempool is not full.\n",
