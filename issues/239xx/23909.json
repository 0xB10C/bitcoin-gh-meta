   "body" : "For demonstration, after [discussion in #23778](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23778#issuecomment-1003005503), and the question as to why we can't just have a `background.tiff` that we copy into the macOS DMG, and do away with the somewhat convoluted image generation steps.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, the only reason we have this image generation as part of our build system is so that forks of Core can adapt the imagery for their own branding via `PACKAGE_NAME`. It don't think it provides much value to us, we know what our project is called, and could just have a static .tiff that we copy into the dmg (replacing the .svg that currently lives in macdeploy/). I have just taken the `background.tiff` as generated by master, and copied it into the macdeploy dir.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoing this would eliminate the following build dependencies:\r\n\r\nFor native macOS:\r\n* `sed` (usage in Makefile.am)\r\n* `librsvg` (rsvg-convert)\r\n* `tiffutil`\r\n\r\nLinux macOS cross-compile:\r\n* `sed` (usage in Makefille.am)\r\n* `librsvg`\r\n* `tiffcp`\r\n* `convert` (imagemagick)\r\n* `font-tuffy`",
