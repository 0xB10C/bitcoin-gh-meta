We also need some way to warn the user for this when they create a new wallet. Showing everything as unconfirmed would be one approach, but maybe it's better to show the transactions as confirmed, but still have a general warning about the background sync. Unconfirmed transactions might give users the wrong idea about e.g. the ability to fee bump or abandon them.\r\n\r\n@jamesob CI is not happy",
