      "body" : "I think the problem with #23799 was that it introduced a second outer loop `while i < test_count:` which broke the `--failfast` option. If that option was chosen and a test failed, the break would leave the inner loop, but since the condition of the outer loop was not fulfilled, the inner loop would just be started again. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, this problem is still there (even though I can't reproduce the \"pop from empty list\" with this branch).",
