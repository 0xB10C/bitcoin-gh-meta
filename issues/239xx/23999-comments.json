Examples of undefined behavior are uninitialized scalars, memory access outside of array bounds, signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, access to an object through a pointer of a different type, etc. Compilers are not required to handle undefined behavior (although many simple situations are diagnosed), and the compiled program is not required to do anything meaningful.\n+\n+**Uninitialized variables** are Undefined Behavior, a typical outcome of which is reading stale stack or register values. In the best case, it generates a pseudorandom result which in edge cases might be the expected result or fixed by the compiler. In the worst case, an exploit may be created that leaks secrets by allowing use of an attacker-controlled value.\n+\n+**MemorySanitizer** (MSan) is a tool that detects uninitialized reads. It consists of a compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library. Typical slowdown is 3x and memory usage is 2x. MSan is supported on Linux/NetBSD/FreeBSD and requires compiling and linking all the code in your program, including libraries it uses and the C++ standard library, with -fsanitize=memory -fPIE -pie.\n+\n+**Valgrind** is a debugging and profiling tool suite to make programs faster and more correct. Its most popular tool, Memcheck, can detect memory-related errors common in C and C++ programs that can lead to crashes and unpredictable behavior. Here is a tutorial. Memcheck is not perfect: typical slowdown is 3-10x, memory usage is 2x, it can produce false positives (there are mechanisms for suppressing these; see the valgrind.supp file in Bitcoin Core), and it doesnât currently detect out-of-range reads or writes to arrays allocated statically or on the stack.\n+\n+### Finding vulnerabilities in pull requests during reviews",

If one of the domains used for default DNS seeds is hacked, this can impact nodes. A node checks 3 seeds at a time, so it would require coordination for a malicious seed to affect the network. You can use own DNS seed for bootstrapping.\n+\n+Difference in DNS seed and Seed node: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/17410/\n+\n+Having multiple connections to the network is fundamental to safety against eclipse attacks. If a user configured the node to only have outbound block-relay-only connections, they wouldn't be participating in addr relay, so wouldn't have a diverse addrman to identify candidates to connect to. It is suggested to have at least 10 outbound connections.\n+\n+`assumevalid=1` skips validation for scripts. All scripts in transactions included in blocks that are ancestors of the _assumevalid_ block are assumed to be valid. While this does introduce a little bit of trust, people can independently check that block is part of the main chain.\n+\n+Known incidents when BGP hijacking was used to exploit Bitcoin users: https://www.wired.com/2014/08/isp-bitcoin-theft/\n+\n+Do not use blocks and chainstate from unknown sources. Attackers could be providing you a false blockchain, i.e. one that is valid but not the blockchain that all other nodes are following.\n+\n+### RPC\n+\n+The JSON-RPC interface is intended for local access. By default it will only accept connections from localhost, but it can be configured to be accessed for a wider netmask; e.g. a trusted LAN network. Bitcoin Core does not allow anyone to connect to the rpcport. You will need to explicitly allow an IP address to connect to it by using the `rpcallowip=<ip>` option in the _bitcoin.conf_ file. If you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will be open to all IP addresses, but this is not recommended as it is not secure.\n+\n+If you have a need to access it over an untrusted network like the internet, tunnel it through technology specifically designed for that, such as stunnel (SSL) or a VPN.\n+\n+[Executable, network access, authentication and string handling](/doc/json-rpc-interface.md#security)\n+\n+[Multi user systems](https://medium.com/@lukedashjr/cve-2018-20587-advisory-and-full-disclosure-a3105551e78b)\n+\n+[#12763](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12763) added the RPC whitelisting feature that helps enforce application policies for services being built on top of Bitcoin Core. It suggested to not connect your Bitcoin node to arbitrary services, reduce risk and prevent unintended access.\n+\n+### Wallet\n+\n+[Encrypting the Wallet](/doc/managing-wallets.md#encrypting-the-wallet)\n+\n+[Backing Up the Wallet](/doc/managing-wallets.md#backing-up-the-wallet)\n+\n+Do not buy _wallet.dat_ files from anywhere. There are several websites that sell such files to newbies. You can read more about the issue here: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/77#issuecomment-721927922\n+\n+Understanding the difference between legacy and descriptor wallets:\n+\n+There is no XPUB in legacy wallets, `dumpwallet` will return private keys. `listdescriptors` can be used to get XPUB and XPRV for descriptor wallets.\n+\n+\n+### Other\n+\n+_*notify_ config and commandline options accept shell commands to be based on different events in Bitcoin Core. Be careful while using these options and ensure that the commands are safe either by manual inspection or restrictions/alerts in the system used.",

Examples of undefined behavior are uninitialized scalars, memory access outside of array bounds, signed integer overflow, null pointer dereference, access to an object through a pointer of a different type, etc. Compilers are not required to handle undefined behavior (although many simple situations are diagnosed), and the compiled program is not required to do anything meaningful.\n+\n+**Uninitialized variables** are Undefined Behavior, a typical outcome of which is reading stale stack or register values. In the best case, it generates a pseudorandom result which in edge cases might be the expected result or fixed by the compiler. In the worst case, an exploit may be created that leaks secrets by allowing use of an attacker-controlled value.\n+\n+**MemorySanitizer** (MSan) is a tool that detects uninitialized reads. It consists of a compiler instrumentation module and a run-time library. Typical slowdown is 3x and memory usage is 2x. MSan is supported on Linux/NetBSD/FreeBSD and requires compiling and linking all the code in your program, including libraries it uses and the C++ standard library, with -fsanitize=memory -fPIE -pie.\n+\n+**Valgrind** is a debugging and profiling tool suite to make programs faster and more correct. Its most popular tool, Memcheck, can detect memory-related errors common in C and C++ programs that can lead to crashes and unpredictable behavior. Here is a tutorial. Memcheck is not perfect: typical slowdown is 3-10x, memory usage is 2x, it can produce false positives (there are mechanisms for suppressing these; see the valgrind.supp file in Bitcoin Core), and it doesnât currently detect out-of-range reads or writes to arrays allocated statically or on the stack.\n+\n+### Finding vulnerabilities in pull requests during reviews",

Attackers could be providing you a false blockchain, i.e. one that is valid but not the blockchain that all other nodes are following.\n+\n+### RPC\n+\n+The JSON-RPC interface is intended for local access. By default it will only accept connections from localhost, but it can be configured to be accessed for a wider netmask; e.g. a trusted LAN network. Bitcoin Core does not allow anyone to connect to the rpcport. You will need to explicitly allow an IP address to connect to it by using the `rpcallowip=<ip>` option in the _bitcoin.conf_ file. If you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will be open to all IP addresses, but this is not recommended as it is not secure.\n+\n+If you have a need to access it over an untrusted network like the internet, tunnel it through technology specifically designed for that, such as stunnel (SSL) or a VPN.\n+\n+[Executable, network access, authentication and string handling](/doc/json-rpc-interface.md#security)\n+\n+[Multi user systems](https://medium.com/@lukedashjr/cve-2018-20587-advisory-and-full-disclosure-a3105551e78b)\n+\n+[#12763](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12763) added the RPC whitelisting feature that helps enforce application policies for services being built on top of Bitcoin Core.

Attackers could be providing you a false blockchain, i.e. one that is valid but not the blockchain that all other nodes are following.\n+\n+### RPC\n+\n+The JSON-RPC interface is intended for local access. By default it will only accept connections from localhost, but it can be configured to be accessed for a wider netmask; e.g. a trusted LAN network. Bitcoin Core does not allow anyone to connect to the rpcport. You will need to explicitly allow an IP address to connect to it by using the `rpcallowip=<ip>` option in the _bitcoin.conf_ file. If you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will be open to all IP addresses, but this is not recommended as it is not secure.\n+\n+If you have a need to access it over an untrusted network like the internet, tunnel it through technology specifically designed for that, such as stunnel (SSL) or a VPN.\n+\n+[Executable, network access, authentication and string handling](/doc/json-rpc-interface.md#security)\n+\n+[Multi user systems](https://medium.com/@lukedashjr/cve-2018-20587-advisory-and-full-disclosure-a3105551e78b)\n+\n+[#12763](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12763) added the RPC whitelisting feature that helps enforce application policies for services being built on top of Bitcoin Core. It suggested to not connect your Bitcoin node to arbitrary services, reduce risk and prevent unintended access.\n+\n+### Wallet\n+\n+[Encrypting the Wallet](/doc/managing-wallets.md#encrypting-the-wallet)\n+\n+[Backing Up the Wallet](/doc/managing-wallets.md#backing-up-the-wallet)\n+\n+Do not buy _wallet.dat_ files from anywhere. There are several websites that sell such files to newbies. You can read more about the issue here: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/77#issuecomment-721927922\n+\n+Understanding the difference between legacy and descriptor wallets:",

If one of the domains used for default DNS seeds is hacked, this can impact nodes. A node checks 3 seeds at a time, so it would require coordination for a malicious seed to affect the network. You can use own DNS seed for bootstrapping.\n+\n+Difference in DNS seed and Seed node: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/17410/\n+\n+Having multiple connections to the network is fundamental to safety against eclipse attacks. If a user configured the node to only have outbound block-relay-only connections, they wouldn't be participating in addr relay, so wouldn't have a diverse addrman to identify candidates to connect to. It is suggested to have at least 10 outbound connections.\n+\n+`assumevalid=1` skips validation for scripts. All scripts in transactions included in blocks that are ancestors of the _assumevalid_ block are assumed to be valid. While this does introduce a little bit of trust, people can independently check that block is part of the main chain.\n+\n+Known incidents when BGP hijacking was used to exploit Bitcoin users: https://www.wired.com/2014/08/isp-bitcoin-theft/\n+\n+Do not use blocks and chainstate from unknown sources. Attackers could be providing you a false blockchain, i.e. one that is valid but not the blockchain that all other nodes are following.\n+\n+### RPC\n+\n+The JSON-RPC interface is intended for local access. By default it will only accept connections from localhost, but it can be configured to be accessed for a wider netmask; e.g. a trusted LAN network. Bitcoin Core does not allow anyone to connect to the rpcport. You will need to explicitly allow an IP address to connect to it by using the `rpcallowip=<ip>` option in the _bitcoin.conf_ file. If you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will be open to all IP addresses, but this is not recommended as it is not secure.\n+\n+If you have a need to access it over an untrusted network like the internet, tunnel it through technology specifically designed for that, such as stunnel (SSL) or a VPN.\n+\n+[Executable, network access, authentication and string handling](/doc/json-rpc-interface.md#security)\n+\n+[Multi user systems](https://medium.com/@lukedashjr/cve-2018-20587-advisory-and-full-disclosure-a3105551e78b)\n+\n+[#12763](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12763) added the RPC whitelisting feature that helps enforce application policies for services being built on top of Bitcoin Core. It suggested to not connect your Bitcoin node to arbitrary services, reduce risk and prevent unintended access.\n+\n+### Wallet\n+\n+[Encrypting the Wallet](/doc/managing-wallets.md#encrypting-the-wallet)\n+\n+[Backing Up the Wallet](/doc/managing-wallets.md#backing-up-the-wallet)\n+\n+Do not buy _wallet.dat_ files from anywhere. There are several websites that sell such files to newbies. You can read more about the issue here: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/77#issuecomment-721927922\n+\n+Understanding the difference between legacy and descriptor wallets:\n+\n+There is no XPUB in legacy wallets, `dumpwallet` will return private keys. `listdescriptors` can be used to get XPUB and XPRV for descriptor wallets.\n+\n+\n+### Other\n+\n+_*notify_ config and commandline options accept shell commands to be based on different events in Bitcoin Core. Be careful while using these options and ensure that the commands are safe either by manual inspection or restrictions/alerts in the system used.",

I don't think the sentence  \"You can use own DNS seed for bootstrapping.\" is helpful, because even if I ran a DNS seed using https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder as suggested, this DNS seed would also need to bootstrap somehow to get going initially. \r\n\r\nAs indicated by the link in my previous post, the bootstrapping mechanism implemented in the DNS seeder not only queries other existing DNS seeds similar to bitcoin core -  so you still \"trust default DNS seeds\" - but is otherwise inferior to the one used by core (no fixed seeds as fallback, outdated hardcoded DNS seed list) - which makes sense because bitcoin-seeder is just not meant to be used for the use case you are suggesting here.",

I don't think the sentence \"You can use own DNS seed for bootstrapping.\" is helpful, because even if I ran a DNS seed using https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin-seeder as suggested, this DNS seed would also need to bootstrap somehow to get going initially.\r\n\r\n@mzumsande \r\n\r\nYes. Sentence can be improved and I am going to add/update a few things but did not because wanted to spend less time doing pull requests on weekend. Looks like this PR has lot of interest from reviewers so I will do it in next few hours.\r\n\r\nThe attack explained in doc assumes most of the DNS seeds are safe but they might get compromised at some point. I am not sure about the code you shared @sipa can explain that better as some domains dont even resolve to anything in that. Example: bitseed.xf2.org However even if we assume these are used once in a lifetime it won't be an issue using 1-2 or get IPs based on your own crawlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Running your own DNS seed makes no sense, for multiple reasons:\r\n\r\n> Seeds are just a way to find an initial connection to the network. If you don't believe the DNS seeds hardcoded in Bitcoin Core are trustworthy enough for that, you should manually make connections to nodes you do trust (using -seednode / -addnode). You can also disable the DNS seeds (-dnsseed=0) in that case.\r\n\r\n> Bitcoin Core offers no functionality to using your own DNS seed.\r\n\r\n@sipa `-seednode` thing is explained in the link and mentioned one word but I can rephrase it in a better way. Will add `-dnsseed=0` on next update. \r\n\r\nBitcoin Core does not offer functionality to use own DNS seed but there has to be one paragraph about trust assumption even if I remove the part that suggested running own DNS seed which is technically possible as there can be several ways to bootstrap. \r\n\r\n",

If one of the domains used for default DNS seeds is hacked, this can impact nodes. A node checks 3 seeds at a time, so it would require coordination for a malicious seed to affect the network. You can use own DNS seed for bootstrapping.\n+\n+Difference in DNS seed and Seed node: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/17410/\n+\n+Having multiple connections to the network is fundamental to safety against eclipse attacks. If a user configured the node to only have outbound block-relay-only connections, they wouldn't be participating in addr relay, so wouldn't have a diverse addrman to identify candidates to connect to. It is suggested to have at least 10 outbound connections.\n+\n+`assumevalid=1` skips validation for scripts. All scripts in transactions included in blocks that are ancestors of the _assumevalid_ block are assumed to be valid. While this does introduce a little bit of trust, people can independently check that block is part of the main chain.\n+\n+Known incidents when BGP hijacking was used to exploit Bitcoin users: https://www.wired.com/2014/08/isp-bitcoin-theft/\n+\n+Do not use blocks and chainstate from unknown sources. Attackers could be providing you a false blockchain, i.e. one that is valid but not the blockchain that all other nodes are following.\n+\n+### RPC\n+\n+The JSON-RPC interface is intended for local access. By default it will only accept connections from localhost, but it can be configured to be accessed for a wider netmask; e.g. a trusted LAN network. Bitcoin Core does not allow anyone to connect to the rpcport. You will need to explicitly allow an IP address to connect to it by using the `rpcallowip=<ip>` option in the _bitcoin.conf_ file. If you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will be open to all IP addresses, but this is not recommended as it is not secure.\n+\n+If you have a need to access it over an untrusted network like the internet, tunnel it through technology specifically designed for that, such as stunnel (SSL) or a VPN.\n+\n+[Executable, network access, authentication and string handling](/doc/json-rpc-interface.md#security)\n+\n+[Multi user systems](https://medium.com/@lukedashjr/cve-2018-20587-advisory-and-full-disclosure-a3105551e78b)",

I don't think that's particularly relevant for security, if users are willing to make arbitrary changes they don't understand.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this isn't a concern, I'm saying this isn't a concern that can be addressed, if you're operating in the assumption that users will make configuration changes or run commands they don't understand.\r\n\r\nTo use an analogy. There is an estate with a walled garden around it and cameras for security. Inside the estate is a mansion, with a terrace. The door to the terrace is often left unlocked in summer while people walk in and out. You're complaining about the fact that people leave the door unlocked, which, while true, isn't a concern because the wall and cameras are supposed to keep attackers out. If the wall and cameras didn't work, there are probably tons of other ways of getting inside the house, because the whole thing relies on it; the window is often left unlocked too.\r\n\r\nThe wall is users knowing that making configuration changes they don't understand can be dangerous. The terrace door is the notify commands. The summer is the advanced users who have a need for those commands. The window left open is running a \"sendtoaddress\" command to empty their wallet.\r\n\r\nYes, the notify commands are special in that they're the only ones that will make Bitcoin Core execute something else. So what? There are tons of other ways a user can be harmed if they don't understand what they're doing. We should be educating people about the risk of unknown commands; not calling these config options out specifically. Doing so might even have the opposite effect: people may think that *anything but* these options cannot cause harm.\r\n\r\nI'm not against mentioning these options as an *example* of something that can go wrong if used without understanding.

If one of the domains used for default DNS seeds is hacked, this can impact nodes. A node checks 3 seeds at a time, so it would require coordination for a malicious seed to affect the network. You can use own DNS seed for bootstrapping.\n+\n+Difference in DNS seed and Seed node: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/17410/\n+\n+Having multiple connections to the network is fundamental to safety against eclipse attacks. If a user configured the node to only have outbound block-relay-only connections, they wouldn't be participating in addr relay, so wouldn't have a diverse addrman to identify candidates to connect to. It is suggested to have at least 10 outbound connections.\n+\n+`assumevalid=1` skips validation for scripts. All scripts in transactions included in blocks that are ancestors of the _assumevalid_ block are assumed to be valid. While this does introduce a little bit of trust, people can independently check that block is part of the main chain.\n+\n+Known incidents when BGP hijacking was used to exploit Bitcoin users: https://www.wired.com/2014/08/isp-bitcoin-theft/\n+\n+Do not use blocks and chainstate from unknown sources. Attackers could be providing you a false blockchain, i.e. one that is valid but not the blockchain that all other nodes are following.\n+\n+### RPC\n+\n+The JSON-RPC interface is intended for local access. By default it will only accept connections from localhost, but it can be configured to be accessed for a wider netmask; e.g. a trusted LAN network. Bitcoin Core does not allow anyone to connect to the rpcport. You will need to explicitly allow an IP address to connect to it by using the `rpcallowip=<ip>` option in the _bitcoin.conf_ file. If you set it to 0.0.0.0, it will be open to all IP addresses, but this is not recommended as it is not secure.\n+\n+If you have a need to access it over an untrusted network like the internet, tunnel it through technology specifically designed for that, such as stunnel (SSL) or a VPN.\n+\n+[Executable, network access, authentication and string handling](/doc/json-rpc-interface.md#security)\n+\n+[Multi user systems](https://medium.com/@lukedashjr/cve-2018-20587-advisory-and-full-disclosure-a3105551e78b)\n+\n+[#12763](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12763) added the RPC whitelisting feature that helps enforce application policies for services being built on top of Bitcoin Core. It suggested to not connect your Bitcoin node to arbitrary services, reduce risk and prevent unintended access.\n+\n+### Wallet\n+\n+[Encrypting the Wallet](/doc/managing-wallets.md#encrypting-the-wallet)\n+\n+[Backing Up the Wallet](/doc/managing-wallets.md#backing-up-the-wallet)\n+\n+Do not buy _wallet.dat_ files from anywhere. There are several websites that sell such files to newbies. You can read more about the issue here: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/77#issuecomment-721927922\n+\n+Understanding the difference between legacy and descriptor wallets:\n+\n+There is no XPUB in legacy wallets, `dumpwallet` will return private keys. `listdescriptors` can be used to get XPUB and XPRV for descriptor wallets.\n+\n+\n+### Other\n+\n+_*notify_ config and commandline options accept shell commands to be based on different events in Bitcoin Core. Be careful while using these options and ensure that the commands are safe either by manual inspection or restrictions/alerts in the system used.",
