Or using one as an oracle to test the other? e.g. Checking if transactions bumped with the help of `MiniMiner` make it into the next block constructed by the actual `BlockAssembler`.",

It just uses what's cached in the mempool entries. The fees don't even need to match inputs - outputs, and mini miner definitely doesn't require ATMP checks.\r\n\r\n> Since this is a \"mini\" version of the BlockAssembler, would it be possible to differentially fuzz the two?\r\n\r\nDifferential fuzzing is perfect for this really.`MiniMiner::BuildMockTemplate(target_feerate)` is supposed to do the exact same thing as `BlockAssembler::addPackageTxs` with `blockmintxfee` = target feerate.\r\n\r\n> Checking if transactions bumped with the help of MiniMiner make it into the next block constructed by the actual BlockAssembler.\r\n\r\nThat would also be a really good way of testing the results (after the wallet stuff is added?). Add the bumping tx, mine another block with the target feerate as min feerate, and see that they all get mined.",
