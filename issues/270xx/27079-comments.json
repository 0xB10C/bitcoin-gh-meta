Itâs not clear to me what problem this would solve.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes feel a few things are easier or better as they have been working for years, however this was the first time I interacted with a guy who already understood how mempool works for other blockchains that I dont want to mention here. It was difficult to educate him about about fee bumping and how this could be avoided if some transaction get dropped in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe limit I shared was 300 MB for most nodes, maybe some nodes use less or more but it wont get propagated if default is less. \r\n\r\nThis motivated me to increase the mempool size as I feel 300 MB is way less than machines we have today. I never imagined I will have a phone with more RAM than my laptop in 2016.  It is possible today and we have better configs for mobile, desktop and server machines.",
