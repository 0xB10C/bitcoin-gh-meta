The existing standardness size limit already unnecessarily limits of the size of them (as Wasabi has pointed out); any further limitation would be undesirable.\r\n\r\nAlso, per-node limits are pretty much pointless when the goal is censorship. It only takes a small % of nodes to get transactions to miners reliably (as shown by the [success of full-RBF](https://petertodd.org/2022/bitcoin-core-nodes-running-fullrbf)).",
