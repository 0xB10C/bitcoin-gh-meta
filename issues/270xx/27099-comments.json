If there's no straightforward solution on the horizon, it would be best to switch to using ZIP instead. Using DMG without a Finder window provides no advantages and only leads to a lot of confusion. As evidence, Visual Studio Code has recently started distributing their macOS builds as ZIP files instead of DMGs, as you can see on their download page: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download.",
