   "body" : "When an encrypted wallet is locked (for instance via the RPC `walletlock`), the documentation indicates that the key is removed from memory:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b92d609fb25637ccda000e182da854d4b762eee9/src/wallet/rpc/encrypt.cpp#L157-L158\r\n\r\nHowever, the vector (a `std::vector<unsigned char, secure_allocator<unsigned char>>`) is merely _cleared_. As it is a member variable, it also stays in scope as long as the wallet is loaded, preventing the secure allocator from deallocating. This allows the key to persist indefinitely in memory. I confirmed this behavior on my macOS machine by using an open-source third party memory inspector (\"Bit Slicer\"). I was able to find my wallet's master key in Bit Slicer after unlocking and re-locking my encrypted wallet. I then confirmed the key data was at the address in LLDB.  \r\n\r\nThis PR manually fills the bytes with zeroes before calling `clear()` by using our `memory_cleanse` function, which is designed to prevent the compiler from optimizing it away. I confirmed that it does remove the data from memory on my machine upon locking.\r\n\r\nNote: An alternative approach could be to call `vMasterKey.shrink_to_fit()` after the `clear()`, which would trigger the secure allocator's deallocation. However, `shrink_to_fit()` is not _guaranteed_ to actually change the vector's capacity, so I think it's unwise to rely on it.\r\n\r\n",
