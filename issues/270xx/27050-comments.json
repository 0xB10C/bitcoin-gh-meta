      "body" : "As @sipa pointed out in the Stack Overflow:\r\n\r\n> `assumevalid` currently in Bitcoin Core only skips script validation. But there are other rules that involve witness data, such as resource limits and the rule that no witness data is allowed for non-witness inputs. \r\n\r\nSo it shifts the meaning of (our baked in) `-assumevalid` somewhat, but only for pruned nodes. Uses may not expect that syncing with `-prune` performs less validation than without. So this probably needs a separate configuration flag.\r\n\r\n> One downside is that nodes serving blocks without witnesses can't serve them directly from disk. They have to un-serialize and re-serialize without the witnesses before sending them.\r\n\r\nDo you mean serving nodes that don't have the witness data? Or do you mean nodes that do (but that's already the case then)?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nodes that come fresh out of IBD we should carefully test the behavior before and after the assumevalid drops below the prune height. Because at that point we should signal `NODE_WITNESS`. For better discoverability we should probably always announce that. In that case we should start downloading witness data a bit before the `assumevalid` block if we're a recent release. But this gets tricky, because the node doesn't know how big future blocks are, so doesn't know when to start downloading witness data. We could change the release process to ensure `assumevalid` is deep enough to account for that.",
