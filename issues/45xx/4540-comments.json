Adding zero fee to a transaction is not recommended, unless you know what you are doing, so it shouldnt have been the default.\r\n\r\nBut changing this now does not make sense, as smart-fee has already been merged to master. With smartfee, if the fee is zero, smart-fee is supposed to do the right thing automatically for you. So actually having the default to zero is supposed to be a good thing, since smart-fee.\r\n",
