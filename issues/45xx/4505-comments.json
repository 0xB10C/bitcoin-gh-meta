Fixed a bug that was exposed by this change.\r\n\r\nWhen a reorganization happens, the disconnected blocks' transaction outputs were wiped from the CCoinsCache, but the empty entries remained there, preventing them from being revived if the same transactions occurred in the other branch too.\r\n\r\nIn case a cache flush happens in between the disconnect and connect (as used to be the case, at least outside of IBD), this is not an issue.",
