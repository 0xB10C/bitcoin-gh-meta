   "body" : "This removes some inconsistencies in what worked and didn't work in\n safemode. Now only RPCs involved in getting balances or sending\n funds are disabled.\n\nPreviously you could mine but not submit blocksÃ¢ÂÂ but we may need more\n blocks to resolve a fork that triggered safe mode in the first place,\n and the non-submission was not reliable since some miners submit\n blocks via multiple means. There were also a number of random commands\n disabled that had nothing to do with the blockchain like verifymessage.\n\nThanks to earlz for pointing out that there were some moderately cheap\n ways to maliciously trigger safe mode, which brought attention to\n the fact that safemode wasn't used in a very intelligent way.\n",
