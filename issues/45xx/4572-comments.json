Coins can be arbitrarily moved between accounts with the 'move' command, which is purely an internal operation.\r\n\r\nThis means that after initially receiving coins there is no correspondence between the accounts and how many coins are 'on' the addresses.\r\n\r\nThe ledger does not influence coin selection when you send coins. No matter whether you use sendfrom, sendmany or other send functions, the coin selection chooses from all coins (unless you use 'coin control' in the GUI).\r\n\r\nMany people get confused by the account system and it is probably the worst code in all of Bitcoin Core.
