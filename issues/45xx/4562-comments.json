EvalScript receives a nHashType parameter but it's only used for checking it is the same as the ones contained at the end of the signatures. As shown in #4555, it is almost always called with a 0 which makes CheckSig ignore the check and just use what's contained at the end of the signature.\r\nI'm still struggling to understand why there can be different sighashes for the same script/output and why they're are placed after the signatures instead of somewhere else.
