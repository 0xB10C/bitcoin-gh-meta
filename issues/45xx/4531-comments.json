Git master isn't presented as something that can be relied on to remain stable or even be very safe to use. Anyone using non-release builds (well, anyone, considering what software we're talking about, but especially if you're not using releases) is being irresponsible if they pull in changes and run them without looking at them or knowing what's happening. This hasn't been in a release yet, I don't see a problem changing this. The same could be said for changing the null-smalldata txout type from 80 to 40 bytes. Not to mention, it's unlikely that there will be numbers that can be shifted by 8 decimal places and still make sense...",
