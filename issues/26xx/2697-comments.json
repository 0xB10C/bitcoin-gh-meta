The fact that it can be more than just numbers (i.e. 0.8.2rc3, not just 0.8.2) is important to clarify, IMHO. Also, I agree with you that it can be confusing regarding where you should and shouldn't prepend a `v' -- I'm not sure why it belongs in some places and not others. If you have any suggestions in the meantime regarding how to phrase it, I'd be glad to hear them.\r\nÃ¢ÂÂ\r\nSent from Mailbox for iPhone\r\n\r\nOn Sun, May 26, 2013 at 2:39 PM, Wladimir J. van der Laan\r\n<notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> The reason for being overly specific is to show the *exact* format in which the version has to be given.
