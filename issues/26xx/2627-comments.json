      "body" : "@rebroad hmm.. i'm not sure if investing in highly volatile bitcoin to fiat exchange rates is the right thing for core-developers. I would just say it's to risky. The exchange rate will probably not be related to the developers work. I made very good experience with donation options for free software. Because you can donate with the software you'd like to donate to, it would be even more interesting. :) But if there is more then one person developing a free/os software, it will maybe be more complicate to use the funds.\r\nBut we might switch this discussion to another issue/platform.
