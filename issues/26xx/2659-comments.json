I thought \"maybe the error was ocurring when there's too many unconfirmed transactions\". I decided to create more 15000 transactions and then I rescanned the blockchain again. And again no problem during the rescan, all went fine even with more than 15000 transactions to confirm. So as I wasn't able to reproduce the error again, I'm closing this.\r\n\r\nPS: all above was done with the same 0.8.1 version.",
