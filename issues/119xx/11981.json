Big thanks to @jonasschnelli for narrowing down the bisection.\r\n\r\nThis is broken for a number of reasons, including:\r\n- g++ understands \"-static-libstdc++ -lstdc++\" to mean \"link against whatever libstdc++ exists, probably shared\", which in itself is buggy.\r\n- another stdlib (libc++ for example) may be in use",
