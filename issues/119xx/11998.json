   "body" : "Hello,\r\ni am keeping my sensitive wallet data (i.e. wallet.dat) on a Veracrypt drive, so i launch my full node with -datadir=< veracrypt volume here >\r\n\r\nBut in that same folder Bitcoin Core keeps the \"blocks\" subdirectory as well.\r\nThe problem is that write operations on a Veracrypt volume are extremely slow due to real-time encryption, so the sync is taking ages.\r\n\r\nSo i may want an additional parameter , say \"-blocks-datadir\" , to be able to download the blockchain on a non-Veracrypt drive , since the blockchain is not sensitive info, while wallet.dat is.\r\n\r\nAre you planning to add such a parameter?\r\nOr do you have other solutions to this?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\np.s. i have tried creating a folder junction ( hard link) with **mklink /J** ( i am under windows ) , in order to point the \"blocks\" folder to another drive.\r\nBut folder junctions only work with NTFS volumes, and my Veracrypt volume is exFAT.\r\nA solution would be to create a new Veracrypt volume , this time NTFS.\r\n\r\nBut if there is already a \"blocks-datadir\" wallet parameter it would be easier for me.\r\nThanks!\r\n",
