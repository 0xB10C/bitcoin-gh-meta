Obviously if no blocks have been written (ie during reindex) there is no reason to do this, but we dont currently have such a concept. I'd doubt this is much of a performance issue as an fflush should be very cheap if there is no data to write. Hopefully, as CChainState refactors move forward, encapsulating this kind of logic should be much simpler in the future.",
