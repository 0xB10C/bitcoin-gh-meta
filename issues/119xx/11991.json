Hint: you can select individual commits in the Files Changed tab. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"848\" alt=\"bech32\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/34299830-5f56e56e-e725-11e7-9e85-877ff0324e9d.png\">\r\n\r\nCheckbox does what you would expect. Press tab from the amount field to get there.\r\n\r\nIt's unchecked by default unless you launch with `-addresstype=bech32`.\r\n\r\nQT generates new addresses by calling `addRow()` which seems a bit of a hack. I added a boolean argument to specify whether bech32 should be used. This makes the situation slightly worse, because this boolean has no meaning in the call from `editaddressdialog.cpp`. In fact, is it even possible for `mode` to be `NewReceivingAddress` there?\r\n\r\nThe change in `receivecoinsdialog.ui` is smaller than it looks, due to the way git handles XML diffs. I had to add a horizontal spacer to make it look decent, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11950#issuecomment-352870909. This causes column numbers to change in the rest of the grid.\r\n\r\nI recommend testing on at least one other OS than OSX to be on the safe side.",
