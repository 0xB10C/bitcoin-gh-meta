If everything you use Homebrew for is\r\nworking fine: please don't worry or file an issue; just ignore this. Thanks!\r\n\r\nWarning: \"config\" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories.\r\n`./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if\r\nsoftware packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when\r\ncompiling and linking.\r\n\r\nHaving additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via\r\nHomebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided\r\nscript of the same name.
