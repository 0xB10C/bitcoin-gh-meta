   "body" : "A temporary block size increase needs to happen or btc may die.  Any devs who refuse should be fired and chased out of the project with pitchforks.  We don't have time to wait. It is costing some people $20-$50 to send a small transaction from an exchange to their wallet.  Bitcoin was suppose to be a low fee world wide payment system not some value of storage that can't be used because the fees are so bad, the fees make AMEX look great!\r\n\r\nFrom my research it seems that the blockstream devs are being paid by a secret society front company called Axa to prevent bitcoin from scaling like in the original white paper.  Henri de Castries who was recently the CEO of AXA Group **WHO IS PAYING THE DEVS** was the Chairman of the  **(((Bilderberg Group)))**.  Jews have a big influence in the Bilderberg group and have ran the finacial systems for 2000+ years getting them **expelled 109 times**.  Jews and Bilderberg friends are trying to ruin bitcoin to keep their fiat ponzi scheme going and the bitcoin core devs are complacent in enslaving the goyim worldwide.  \r\n",
