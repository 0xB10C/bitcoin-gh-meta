   "body" : "This PR improves the BSD compatibility of the bdb4 installer script.\r\n\r\nSee #11921, #11868.\r\n\r\nI've tested this on OpenBSD 6.2.\r\n\r\nThis needs testing on OSX at least, and on gcc/Linux to make sure that applying the patch unconditionally doesn't negatively affect gcc.\r\n\r\nNB: this is not yet sufficient to make `install_db4.sh` work on FreeBSD, as we need to use yet another `sha256` tool there. But it's a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\n### contrib: New clang patch for install_db4\r\n\r\nReplace the clang patch with a new and improved version that also fixes\r\nthe build issues with OpenBSD and FreeBSD's clang, and apply it\r\nunconditionally.\r\n\r\nThanks to @fanquake for finding the patch.\r\n\r\n### contrib: Make X=Y arguments work in install_db4  Ã¢ÂÂ¦\r\n\r\nTrailing X=Y arguments are supposed to be passed through unchanged\r\nto bdb's configure. This was not the case, at least with OpenBSD\r\n6.2's shell.\r\n\r\nFix this by not storing the arguments in a temporary variable but\r\npassing \"$@\" through directly.\r\n",
