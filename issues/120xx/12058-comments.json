Maybe there's some way to give MacOS a hint which files to be on the SSD part? (Or maybe it eventually figures this out).\r\n\r\nI don't think you can do that, although we could see which files are being stored on the SSD with some cli tricks.",

One simple thing to try is to drop your OS-level disk caches with /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches before load, benchmark a load, and then do a cat ~/.bitcoin/chainstate/* > /dev/null before load and benchmark again to see whether having the DB in OS cache helps.",
