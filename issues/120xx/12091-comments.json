      "body" : "@bolekC From my understanding of Spectre, the attack is towards a specific process and its memory. The examples given in the paper are towards the kernel, but AFAIU, it is not limited to just the kernel. In fact the PoC given in the paper does not do anything with the kernel at all.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise is to give a process some untrusted input which it then does input validation before allowing execution to proceed. The attack makes use of speculative execution that is performed before the input is fully validated in order to leak data from that process's memory. So no, it is not an attack on the kernel and it does require user applications to have mitigation in place in order to avoid the application from having its secrets leaked.\r\n\r\nSpectre requires knowing specific memory locations of data in the application, having memory in the user application that the external application can access and measure timings for, and knowing exactly what the code is doing. The third part is trivially achievable with open source applications.",
