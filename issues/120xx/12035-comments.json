      "body" : "@jb55 you can actually drag & drop images onto Github, so they're inline.\r\n\r\nThere's more places where \"bits\" would appear, e.g. in the settings and as a dropdown in the send screen. If we go for `bits (ÃÂµBTC)` that would probably look fine in a dropdown menu, but look terrible on the transactions screen. Whereas `bits` probably looks fine everywhere.\r\n\r\nI remember the first time I saw the term \"bits\" in a wallet (Xapo). I found it very confusing, because I didn't know how many decimals it represents. I'm fine with switching to bits, but shouldn't assume all users are familiar with it. So it requires some education.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to achieve a minimum level of education is to have two strings. Use the short version `bits` everywhere expect the dropdown menus, where you use the long string `bits (ÃÂµBTC)`. That would add a few lines of code to this PR, but nothing unsurmountable. Let me know if you need any pointers.\r\n\r\nThe tooltips are useful as well, but I don't think those appear over the dropdown menus.",
