I assume it's possible to get a transaction sent out while being offline.\r\n\r\nHaving to \"send\" the transaction unnecessary / annoying, but it doesn't matter in any case since the box is permanently offline.  Still, having the ability to view the signed transaction without having to actually send it would be nice, though I guess not absolutely necessary.",
