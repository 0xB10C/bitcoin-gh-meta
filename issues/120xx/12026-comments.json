They are important because it tells people at a very quick glance about the maturity and stability of a project.\r\n\r\nDespite protests from some developers, I think Bitcoin at this point can be considered both mature and stable, especially from a software-compatibility perspective. So I am in favor of upgrading to `v17.0.0` as the new naming scheme. Other than dropping the leading zero, I don't think anything else needs to be changed - the Bitcoin core naming scheme is already pretty reasonable.",
