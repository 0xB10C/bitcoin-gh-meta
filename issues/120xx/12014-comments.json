Try making this change to step 2 in build-osx.md.\r\nI provided a detailed writeup of my experience building bitcoin on MacOS Sierra build at [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2045748.msg20378938#msg20378938), which may be of some use.

I've just setup a new Qt Creator project for bitcoin-qt using the instructions in the [osx readme](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md):\r\n![screen shot 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863730/34427383-859c1580-ec7c-11e7-8d00-6b09fe14c65e.png)\r\n\r\nEnsure that your build directory is ```path/to/bitcoin/src/qt``` and your executable, in Run configuration, is ```path/to/bitcoin/src/qt/bitcoin-qt```.\r\n\r\n@jimhashhq building with the gui enabled is the default, so you shouldn't have to explicitly pass it to configure. Passing ```--with-gui=yes``` to autogen should have no affect.",
