I've also added instructions\r\non how to build with GUI/Qt 5 support, as some of us actually use\r\nOpenBSD as a desktop system. ;-)\r\n\r\n- Remove the GCC section as OpenBSD now ships with LLVM as of 6.2.\r\n- Remove the Resources section as it only applied to GCC.\r\n- Add instructions for building with Qt 5 support.\r\n- Change the Berkeley DB section to not mention Boost and instead\r\n  explain that the packages version is too old.\r\n- Add a 'gmake install' at the end of the build section.\r\n\r\nTested on a fresh install of both OpenBSD 6.2 and the -current.",
