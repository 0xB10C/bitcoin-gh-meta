      "body" : "Interesting, I had a idea about five days ago of how to improve estimation (which can be network-bound or cpu-bound):\r\n\r\n-Include with each checkpoint the size of the blockchain at that checkpoint (which will loosely correspond with CPU work as well as download bandwidth)\r\n-Include with the last checkpoint a multiplier to estimate additional CPU expense per block to do full verification after last checkpoint (i.e. blocks will take 3x more time to verify with signature checking). This can also be a guess of future network growth: \"how many more transactions per block will we see than between the last two checkpoints\".\r\n\r\nthen:\r\n-Obtain estimated (or actual) blockchain size at the current block, from interpolation between known sizes at checkpoints,\r\n-Estimate the total size/cpu_work of the current blockchain by extrapolating beyond the last checkpoint to the current height,\r\n-Progress bar percentage is current block's estimated size, divided by total estimated size.\r\n\r\n![progressbarformula](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1425520/160100/dffeae00-7758-11e2-82cb-e084a6481a70.png)\r\n\r\nMore advanced than I could write: curve fitting.

It started with about 100 week(s) behind, and the bar was nearly empty. Now I'm at 29 week(s) behind, and the bar is filled by perhaps 15%. I'd expect to be filled either at about 70% or at about 85%, depending on if the progress is relative to genesis or to app start.\r\n\r\nActually I'm not convinced that a progress bar is a suitable metaphor for blockchain download at all, because a) download never finishes and b) the blockchain is not a chain.",

Effectively, it counts/estimates transactions, weighing those after the last checkpoint higher, as those require higher much more CPU.\r\n\r\nThe factor used to scale post-checkpoint transactions should reflect the time factor (download + process + sigcheck) / (download + process). The factor that is currently hardcoded (15.0) was determined by running on some system, and indeed not taking download time into account. Doing so would probably result in a lower number. Feel free to do benchmarks so the factor can be improved.\r\n\r\nIf I understand you correctly, you suggest that your method (using block chain size, and hardcode sizes in the checkpoints) will better account for download time?

I do not have a constant time per block (with a different speed before/after the checkpoint) - it's a constant time per _transaction_ (with a different speed before/after the checkpoint), and transactions have a pretty constant size on average, so it's proportional to the size in bytes of the chain.\r\n\r\nAlso, I do not claim the current implementation is correct for everyone. That's not possible with a constant slowdown factor after the checkpoint. For it to be exact, this factor would depend on whether or not your downloading (or reindexing from disk), the degree of parallellism you have for script validation, and a few other things probably.\r\n\r\nWhat I do claim, is that given a good factor (specifcally for the user's system - abstracting from how that factor is obtained), it is accurate in the general case. For example, if download time dominates everything and local processing/verification can be ignored, setting the factor=1 should result in more or less the same progress you'd calculate.",

What you're proposing is actually just a less accurate version of what Sipa already implemented his change uses the transaction count which is very closely related to size and more strongly correlated with the work than size is).",
