While it would be nice to have\r\nusers follow the normal CreateTransaction/CommitTransaction process\r\nwe use internally, there isnt much benefit in exposing this option,\r\nespecially with HD wallets, while there is ample room for users to\r\nmisunderstand or misuse this option.\r\n\r\nThis partially reverts #9377. Would be nice to get this for 15 since its kinda crazy we have this option to begin with IMO, will need release notes as an RPC option is now ignored.",
