   "body" : "Apologies for the mostly code move only PR. This is a pre-req for both #10740 and #10762 \r\n\r\nAll wallet component initialization/destruction functions are now in their own walletinit.cpp translation unit and are no longer static functions on the CWallet class. The bitcoin_server also no longer has any knowledge that there are multiple wallets in vpwallet.\r\n\r\nA few small changes in behavior. The most important one is that `Flush()` no longer gets called twice on shutdown. I think this is fine, and all the tests pass, but this probably requires some careful consideration from people who are more familiar with the wallet code.\r\n\r\nLots of commits to aid reviewers. Can be squashed down prior to merge.",
