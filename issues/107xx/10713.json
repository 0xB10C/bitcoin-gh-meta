Vlamidir colluded with Blockstream full-time liars to hijack this repo successfully and refused to return it back to Gavin. The current Core Committee no longer follows Satoshi's vision and they tell lies to defame Satoshi & Gavin & Mike Hearn regularly.\r\n\r\nThis should be updated so people can more reasonably distinguish between the two.\r\n\r\nThe current Core Committee has been corrupt completely. Good guys left one after another. Only unashamed clown still stay as a Core Committee member.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the new Bitcoin reference client supported by the majority: https://github.com/btc1/bitcoin",
