      "body" : "History of fundrawtransaction regarding change-output:\r\nBefore 0.14, the change-output keys was never reserved from the key pool (flaw-ish).\r\nSince 0.14, by default, the key will be reserved but there is an option to not reserve it (keep the old behaviour) done via #9377. The option was added because the assumption was that API consumers relay on this old, flaw-ish, behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis PR would basically remove the option to not reserve the key.\r\n\r\nI think in general we should do that, though I'm not sure if there are any API consumers who expect that one can _avoid_ reserving the CO-key. But indeed, that should stop.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK 6715e782c3049ec43c0c94268f9ad924988e5ddf.\r\nPR should have a short release-notes description.",
