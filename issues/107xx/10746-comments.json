It's chosen on first run.\r\n\r\n> It does not even have to be the full sample as found in contrib, just having an empty config file (or one with a minimal comment directing people to the sample file) created by default \r\n\r\nIf you are using the GUI, there's a button in the debug window to open it, also the path of the data directory can be found there.\r\n\r\n>  OS-agnostic configuration in the correct OS-specific location without some unnecessary trial-and-error.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this part is OS/distro-specific.\r\n\r\nThere is no requirement that the configuration file is writable (by the user that the daemon runs at) at all. A common setup for system-wide daemons is to put the configuration file somewhere under `/etc/` and specify it using `-conf`. For this reason we don't write to the configuration file from `bitcoind` itself, not even to create it initially.\r\n",
