Including `medianweight`, `medianfee`, `medianfeerate`, `medianoutput` etc would expose these useful quantities to the user.",

I prefer:\r\n\r\nIf it's not really needed, why add it?\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps a nice-to-have, but since #8704, `getblock` can return all transactions in a block (without requiring `txindex`). Those can then be parsed and analysed offline.\r\n\r\nIs there a compelling use-case I'm missing here? This seems like a feature only a small subset of users would be interested in, in which case an offline tools seems more appropriate.\r\n\r\nSorry - not meaning to be negative, but my default reaction to new RPCs/arguments tends towards NACK unless I can see a compelling and widespread use-case.",
