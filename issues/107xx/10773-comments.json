We've had plenty of issues with otherwise innocuous shell script changes breaking dash-based systems, not to mention BSD incompatibilities, plus now WSL, so there is nontrivial review for some of these things, if its just because they are prettier or feel nicer, I really think we should cut back some of these changes.",
