You could delete the `WalletInitSignals` struct and replace the `WalletInitSignals` global variable with a `std::unique_ptr<WalletInitInterface>` global. This would get rid of all the boost signals code and make the control flow simpler.\r\n\r\nAlso you should prefix global variables with `g_`. And I think this PR would be less error prone and simpler to review if you just left the init code in wallet.cpp for now and moved the relevant functions to walletinit.cpp in followup MOVEONLY PR.\r\n\r\n",
