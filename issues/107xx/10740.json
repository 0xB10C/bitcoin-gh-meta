   "body" : "Adds `loadwallet` and `unloadwallet` RPCs. This allows wallets to be loaded and unloaded dynamically during runtime without having to stop-start the node with new `-wallet` params.\r\n\r\nMain motivation for this was the fact that several wallet parameters are actions for individual wallet load/creation, rather than properties of the wallet component. Examples are `-salvagewallet`, `-rescan`, `-usehd` and `-upgradewallet`. Continuing with that config/loading model is difficult in a multi-wallet world - how can users run those actions on individual wallets when loading multiple wallets? This PR offers a solution: individual wallets can be loaded at run-time, and RPC parameters can be passed in to carry out the various wallet-loading actions. Note that none of those load actions are yet implemented in this PR, but can easily be added.\r\n\r\nA lot of the work in this PR was disentangling wallet initialization and destruction. Hopefully the result is that the interface between init.cpp and the wallet component is now cleaner. All wallet component initialization/destruction functions are now in their own walletinit.cpp translation unit and are no longer static functions on the CWallet class. The bitcoin_server also no longer has any knowledge that there are multiple wallets in vpwallet. Hopefully this is also useful work towards #7965 and the removal of circular server<->wallet dependencies. That part of this PR (commits \"Add walletinit.cpp\" through \"remove early call to FlushWallets()\") can be separated into a different PR if that makes reviewing easier.\r\n\r\nIncludes functional test, builds on top of #10604.\r\n\r\nCurrently looking for concept/API feedback. This branch builds and passes tests, but requires some more work before fully ready for review.",
