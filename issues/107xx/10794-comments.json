I've tried to describe what I think would be better alternatives in my previous review comments, like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9483#issuecomment-278799990.\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli, assuming you don't want to take my previous suggestions, and do want to stick with the current design, I think it would be helpful if you could reach out to some other reviewers and get some concept acks for your current approach. It might help to put together some kind of design document, or at least a detailed comment to the top of `auxiliaryblockrequest.h` that lays out how the class works and what your future plans for it are in as much detail as possible, so someone can understand how it's intended to be used without having to wade through all the PRs.",

      "body" : "@ryanofsky:\r\nThank you very much for the reviews in #9483. I implemented almost all of your suggesting and some of them where really great.\r\nHowever, I think the current design of having a dedicated class (`CauxiliaryBlockRequest`) makes sense, because...\r\n\r\n* An out-of-band (auxiliary) block request in an object, you could have multiple in parallel (assume multiwallet, etc.), in future, we may want to serialise them to disk, etc. Therefore I think it should be capsulated in its own class.\r\n\r\n* I think the wallet needs control. For a light-client mode, the wallet is the one that tells the node what it needs. More or less, wallet tells node: \"I need block A to E, give them to me as fast as possible\", then node may call back \"I have block A already ready (on disk), rest will follow soon\", etc. Wallet then may say: \"Okay, thats enough, you can stop at B already\", etc.\r\n\r\n* Having the implementation in a designated file makes code overview simpler. It can result in having slightly more lines of code but it should worth it. Having another `main.cpp` for everything that is network related should be avoided now, early enough. I don't think we have a lot of duplicated code, or can you point out what would be more compact if we would implement it directly in `net_processing.cpp`?\r\n\r\n* Last but not least, it allows to have a patch-set the requires less rebasing. And this is an important one to me. Eventually, this will be something that \"runs along\" with the master branch until there has been reasonable amount of testing before it gets eventually merged.",
