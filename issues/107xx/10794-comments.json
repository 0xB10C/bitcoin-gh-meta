      "body" : "I'd like to help out here, and I've spent literally days reviewing previous iterations of this change (#9076 #9483 #9171), but I can't figure out if this is going anywhere and if providing more review now is a good use of time.\r\n\r\nAs I've mentioned previously, I don't think the auxiliary block download class design is great, because it duplicates functionality from the networking layer in a wholly different part of the code, and gives the wallet too much control & responsibility over low level p2p details in the case where it's used to let the wallet code prioritize which blocks to download. I've tried to describe what I think would be better alternatives in my previous review comments, like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9483#issuecomment-278799990.\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli, assuming you don't want to take my previous suggestions, and do want to stick with the current design, I think it would be helpful if you could reach out to some other reviewers and get some concept acks for your current approach. It might help to put together some kind of design document, or at least a detailed comment to the top of `auxiliaryblockrequest.h` that lays out how the class works and what your future plans for it are in as much detail as possible, so someone can understand how it's intended to be used without having to wade through all the PRs.",
