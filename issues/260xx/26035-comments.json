In between Tor upgrade was done in the machine and later Bitcoin Core just continuously tried to connect to cached Tor v2 onion peers, which it, of course, was unable to do, as new versions of Tor support only v3 onions. I solved issue by manually adding some known Tor v3 peer, but some less tech savvy user could have got stuck there.",
