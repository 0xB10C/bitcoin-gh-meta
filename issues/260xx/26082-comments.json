The `interface::Wallet` class is an abstract class and the methods it declares are intentionally non-const, because making them const exposes internal implementation details of `interface::Wallet` subclasses that callers should not be aware of. In practice, it breaks multiprocess support (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25337#discussion_r916367659, commit e81daff985867bfe88fdef325384dac344eb6aad from #10102).
