It's much more equivalent to running `apt/dnf/brew update`; giving you access to updated versions of packages to install, new features in Guix, bug fixes, support for new platforms/hardware etc. Fwiw I'd consider the [`core-updates`](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/log/?h=core-updates) branch to be the \"development branch\" of Guix.\r\n\r\n> Everyone running the latest release of guix should be fine without the changes here.\r\n\r\nSometime prior to May (assuming the command is removed as stated) our scripts will have to change, as we'll need to accomodate builders who keep their Guix updated. Once we make that change, anyone who's not run`guix pull` will no-longer be able to build (master at least), as `guix shell` wont exist in their Guix binary.\r\n\r\nThis will also effect any other branch still using `guix environment`, and then this change would need to be backported, so it can continue to be Guix built. \r\n\r\nI'm not trying to force anything on Guix builders early, but I also don't see the benefit in leaving this until later, or right up until the point that things might break; especially if currently the only trade-off is accomodating builders who don't want to update their package manager.",
