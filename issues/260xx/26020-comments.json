      "body" : "@aureleoules thanks for pointing out that `m_subtract_fee_outputs` is _not_ used in that test.  After examining that test more closely, it doesn't seem to be testing wait it's supposed to be:\r\n\r\n[// Test fees subtracted from output](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L317)\r\n\r\nAs you say, the param `subtract_fee_outputs` isn't being used.  In the first assertion the value being selected is [1 sat](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L313) while the second is using [1 * CENT](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L322) which is why there's a difference in the first and second assertion.  Also, there is no way to use a negative effective value like the [comment says](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L314).  There's a specific assert that precludes it [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L76).\r\n\r\nAll in all, maybe the [test](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/test/coinselector_tests.cpp#L304:L325) should be removed in a future PR.  Another possibility is to fix it to test this [statement](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L368) which maybe was the original intent.",
