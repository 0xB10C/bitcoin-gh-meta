I would argue that making dumpprivkey function would actually be a much safer scenario than making less technical or just unlucky people \"figure it out\" with their xpriv and descriptors since:\r\n\r\nOption 1) dumprivkey - maximum leaked data is the private key of one address\r\n\r\nOption 2) listdescriptors + derivation - copy/pasting xprv into unknown 3rd party software which may be malicious (compromising entire wallet), them asking people for \"help\" and getting scammed, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are also things like clipboard monitoring viruses, which again the potential damage there is the private key of one address versus the xprv of the entire wallet.\r\n\r\nOverall I think it's actually much safer to make dumpprivkey work normally.",

It sounds like you misunderstand the concern with the parent xpub and child private key - given a parent xpub and a child private key derived with unhardened derivation, the parent xprv can be computed. It is far less obvious that this is the case, and therefore far more dangerous than retrieving the xprv. The xprv is more obviously something that is meant to be kept secret.",
