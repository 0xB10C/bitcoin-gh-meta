If our time is off by more than 10 minutes, we will most likely not take part in it and not forward addresses received from others.\r\nThat would not prevent us from accepting addrs to addrman / finding outbound peers. But we wouldn't help the network and our own advertised address would be off by 10 minutes and not relayed by others as well, so we'd likely have a harder time getting inbound peers.\r\n\r\nI was [thinking more](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23807#discussion_r824470943) about our own peer selection in this case, especially deprioritizing in the context of `10+ minutes in the future get 5 days of penalty`.\r\n\r\nI don't think this PR significantly worsens any existing behavior or opens any new attack surface.\r\n\r\nFor the \"natural\" behavior, it doesn't matter much because addr relay freshness has a lag of hours, not minutes (maybe an issue with immediate self-announcements, but those are already connected).\r\nFor the attacks, an attacker could always manipulate the addr timestamps how they wanted, and this PR doesn't make it easier.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nRe fingerprinting, I think that would be cool to investigate even for the current master.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOtherwise I agree with the summary of @mzumsande.",
