This will put frustration and mental burden on our users, so there should be a convincing motivation for the deprecation. If it is expensive for us to maintain the createmultisig logic, then it can go. However, if the code is mostly sitting around idle and working fine, I don't see a great maintenance benefit in removing it. Simply updating the documentation to mention the new RPC should be enough, like I did for `getunconfirmedbalance` (instead of removing it).",

Every RPC has a maintenance cost though e.g. regularly running the associated RPC test and debugging of that test (#20183). Taking this perspective to the extreme ends up with a bunch of overlapping RPCs, no one knows why they are there (not a good user experience) and an ever expanding set of useless functional tests (not a good developer experience).",

It was a general issue of the user running a lot of functional tests on slow hardware, running into timeouts. The issue would have existed even if the createmultisig RPC was already removed with the test. Even if the issue was related to the RPC, I think having to debug a test issue once a year (or having to do minimal maintenance like bumping the copyright header once a year on the file) is an acceptable cost. And there will (either intentionally or accidentally) always be overlapping RPCs. If this was something to avoid, we could start removing almost all optional features.\r\n\r\nI am not against adding documentation to clarify that another RPC exists and that one of them is considered \"soft\" deprecated. I am against forcing users to either run vulnerable EOL versions of the software or make them potentially rework their whole software stack during an upgrade for no reason (or a weak one).",
