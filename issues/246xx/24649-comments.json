      "body" : "I'm not entirely sure that this is what we want to do. When I implemented that external input weight feature, I specifically decided to allow user provided weight to override what the wallet does. This is because if a user were using `walletcreatefundedpsbt` or `fundrawtransaction`, it is possible that they are going to use a different signer and are merely using the wallet as a watchonly wallet. We can't know how the other signer is going to behave. Furthermore, with taproot descriptors, and with miniscript coming up soon, the wallet does not necessarily know which script branch is going to be taken and may end up using the wrong script branch when estimating size. By allowing the user to override the size estimation, the user can effectively tell provide a more accurate size estimation depending on the branch taken.",
