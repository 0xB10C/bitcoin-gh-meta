However the implementation here has some issues, although not necessarily blocking ones.\r\n\r\n* If either mainnet `bitcoind` of `bitcoin-qt -server` is not running, then the autocompletion for `bitcoin-cli` shows `error:` and `Make` as autocompletions. These are the first words of the error it gives when the RPC server is not found. They should probably be excluded from the completion.\r\n* The `-help-debug` options are missing. While these are debug options, some commonly used ones such as `-regtest` are part of them and I expect that the only people who would be using these completions are developers who also use those debug options. So it might make sense to include them as well.\r\n* `bitcoin-qt` should have completions\r\n* Attempting to get a completion with the relative path to the binary results in an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> src/bitcoind ~/.config/fish/completions/bitcoind.fish (line 1): Unknown command.
