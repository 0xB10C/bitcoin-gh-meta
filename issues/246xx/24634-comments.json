No wonder it runs so fast, we're benching a no-op... :facepalm:\r\n\r\n> Aside from this problem, we should also probably just re-use the CTxMemPool in TestingSetup.\r\n\r\nAgreed.\r\n\r\n> Manually specifying check_ratio to 1 (according to the original intention) and running the MempoolCheck benchmark results in an assertion error:\r\n\r\nThis is because `CreateOrderedCoins` references UTXOs which don't actually exist on chain to construct transactions. My bad for not realizing that. The solution is to either use a `TestChain100Setup` instead of `TestingSetup` so we have some coins to work with, or create a fake `CCoinsCache` with the UTXOs needed in `CreateOrderedCoins`.",
