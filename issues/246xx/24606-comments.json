If we don't, then we shouldn't do the changes here either.\r\n\r\nNo objection to the changes here, but to me it seems to combine the worst of everything:\r\n\r\n* It disables the clumsy code by default, making it effectively dead code, since almost no user changes the default values.\r\n* It doesn't give any benefits to modules that use adjusted time, as they still need to assume adjusted time may be wrong, even though the system time is correct.\r\n* User that realize they might need this setting (and change the default) might easier just set the correct system time. Or are you going to write release notes saying: \"If your system clock is wrong, please make sure to set -maxtimeadjustment to the value your clock is wrong at most.\"  Instead of: \"If your clock is wrong, correct it\".",
