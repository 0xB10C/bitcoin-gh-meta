For example, GetHash() needs to be done using a constant version number, or everything would break, but used PROTOCOL_VERSION formerly. If we ever do a protocol change that adds fields to blocks or transactions, this has to be thought through thoroughly, and many places where PROTOCOL_VERSION is used, will need to be changed to pNode->nVersion, for example. With this change, those places become obvious.",
