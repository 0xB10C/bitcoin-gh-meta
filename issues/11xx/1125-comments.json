      "body" : "Hmmm. Changing line 85 of db.cpp to just:\r\n\r\n            filesystem::path pathLogDir = \"database\";\r\n\r\nSeems to solve the problem. When the log path is relative, it will take it relative to the data directory, not relative to the current directory.\r\n\r\nThis is documented here: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_02/html/gsg_txn/CXX/enabletxn.html\r\n\r\n    You can cause log files to be created in a directory other than the environment home \r\n    directory by using the DbEnv::set_lg_dir() method. The directory identified here must exist. \r\n    If a relative path is provided, then the directory location is resolved relative to the \r\n    environment's home directory.\r\n\r\nI don't understand what broke it though. Looking back, pathLogDir was always built in this way.\r\n\r\n(note: this is not a correct fix, as the filesystem::create_directory *will* use the current directory as base...)\r\n",
