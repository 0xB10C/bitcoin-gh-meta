I'd still suggest this issue remains open pending further investigation - and if anyone has any advice on how to debug this, I'd be happy to help. I'm shortly planning to upgrade from Oneiric to Precise, so perhaps that will fix the problem. I don't believe my desktop has had any unusual configuration changes. It's pretty much a stock Oneiric AFAIK.",
