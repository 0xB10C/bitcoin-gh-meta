Is it possible you didn't use -proxy?\r\n\r\nThat received version message means that you connected to siqdznszjf4e6v5j.onion:8333, and thereby reached a peer who thinks you are 127.0.0.1 (so it came from their Tor proxy), and believes he has address 106.187.36.183. Which version was the peer running? Recent versions shouldn't announce 127.0.0.1 as their own address, and if the other node also ran this torhs branch, if it was running using -externalip=....onion, it should report its onion address instead.\r\n\r\nEdit: obviously, the peer is running 0.5.2 (as it reports protocol version 50200). If you'd connect to a 0.6.0 or torhs node, you'll see different behaviour.",

Also, I the fact that proxydns ran when connect was set was kind of surprising, but I guess thats really independent of this pull: connect should probably imply dnsseed=0.\r\n\r\nThe effective deactivation of anti-dos for incoming onion peers is kind of unfortunate.
