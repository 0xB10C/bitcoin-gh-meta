With mempool eviction combined with the new behaviour that unconfirmed txs still tie up the coins they spend even if the txs are not in the mempool, users may end up with permanently unspendable coins frequently.\r\n\r\nWe discussed making this change in conjunction with the other changes back in November, but it appears to have slipped through the cracks.\r\n",
