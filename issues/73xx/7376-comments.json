Essentially anything that uses OP_RETURN is currently incompatible with Payments.

If you give an OP_RETURN a > dust value, Bitcoin Core will process it (how I created that transaction on blockinfo). I can't imagine why this would be supported since it destroys value. \r\n\r\nThe two potential fixes are:\r\n\r\n1. Allow *only* zero value OP_RETURN in PaymentDetails as I suggest.\r\n2. Don't allow any OP_RETURN scripts.\r\n\r\nRight now we have a situation where only OP_RETURNs with value are supported which seems like the worst of all options.",

Even though some people (like yourself) would rather **no** data be encoded on the blockchain, OP_RETURN gave people a less damaging way to do what they were going to do anyway.\r\n\r\nNow with zero value payments the situation is the same. I *could* shutdown key.run and call it a day since destroying value is suboptimal. Or I could just burn 6,000 satoshi per transaction and keep moving forward.\r\n\r\nAlso, from a pure design perspective I would say it's definitely a smell to have such broken functionality live.",
