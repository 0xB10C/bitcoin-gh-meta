First off, I'm a new contributor, I've been working at the application layer of bitcoin for a couple years now, but this is my first dive into the implementation details of core.\r\n\r\nAs such, if you have any suggestions about specific files to look at, or a clarification of the following terminology, it would help me immensely in being able to answer A. whether it exists still, and B. a test that can ensure it is not reintroduced.\r\n\r\n1. What is a \"conflicted transaction\" formally?\r\n2. What is a \"wallet tx\" and how/when would it not appear in the mempool?\r\n3. What does it mean to mark a transaction as \"dirty\"\r\n\r\nI will do my best to find out the answers to these questions on my own but any references to which files this logic is contained in or definitions for the terms above would jumpstart my ability to figure this out.",
