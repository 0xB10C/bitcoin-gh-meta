      "body" : "Concept ACK. It's good that 'modules' can register their own RPC calls. The wallet is a prime example of this, but there may be more in the future.\r\n\r\nSome nits:\r\n\r\n- `walletRegisterRPCCommands` should not be on CWallet. CWallet is the class that implements the wallet. A better place is in `rpcwallet.cpp`.\r\n- `walletRegisterRPCCommands` implementation should not be in the header file, but in an implementation file\r\n- The contents (initialization) of `const CRPCCommand vWalletRPCCommands[]` belong in an implementation file, not a header file. Having a data structure initialization in a header file  means it can only be included in one place, otherwise there will be duplicate definition errors.\r\n",
