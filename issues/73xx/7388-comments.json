I do however think this due to a misunderstanding:\r\n* It's perfectly possible to keep accepting 0-conf transactions, if you believe they are safe for your use case. Opt-in RBF sets a non-maximum nSequence value, which causes many providers to already consider the transaction non-standard for the purpose of accepting 0-conf.\r\n* As a customer, you can choose to set opt-in RBF, and thus lose the ability to get your payment accepted before confirmation, but with the ability to easily change the fee afterwards or combine the transaction with others.\r\n* As a miner, the rational behaviour is to take the transaction with the highest fee (even for non opt-in cases). If you don't, another miner can.\r\n\r\nAnd, no, opt-in RBF is not theft. It's indicating that you're not sure whether what you're submitting is the final form of the transaction. This is the exact semantics that nSequence had since the earliest version of Bitcoin.\r\n",

That would be possible.\r\n\r\nBut most (all) wallets do already treat unconfirmed transactions/balance as **unconfirmed**. People should really not rely on **unconfirmed** balance. It's **unconfirmed**. ~~As recently shown by Peter Todd, it's quite easy to double spend your transaction, and this was without RBF being deployed.~~ If they rely on 0-conf they should use a merchant tools which includes risk analysis. \r\n\r\nIf you are selling services or goods after you have received a 0-conf transaction, you should be very careful with handing out the good/service while the transaction is **not confirmed** and you should certainly not use a standard wallet (you would take a very high risk).

If that didn't happen, nothing would get done and we wouldn't see new features.\r\n\r\nHow are they interfering with the free block space market?

They must also come up with new workflows to deal with clientele who accidentally flag transactions as RBF.  Most retailers wont bother with this hassle (at best) and potentially ignorant retailers will lose a lot of money (at worst). This policy change (and by policy i am referring to the default settings since 99% of node operators will not change the defaults) is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb on the retailer community.  ",

This is something that you should know all about and show us before you implement such dramatic changes to policy.\r\n\r\nSipa is saying that there are no services which accept 0-conf transactions that accept non-final transactions. Since opt-in makes it non-final, they are already prepared for that. He (and everyone else on the team) has already looked at the services and have already determined that they all already deal with non-final transactions. He is saying that you would not be able to find any service that doesn't already deal with those non-final 0-conf transactions because they all do.\r\n\r\n> I think it is really bad the way you guys are trying to force bitcoin into lightningcoin. Stealing fees from the miners will kill the long term viability of the Bitcoin network.\r\n\r\nHow is it stealing fees from miners? If anything, it increases fees for them.\r\n\r\n> You can see what the community thinks of RBF here:\r\n\r\nHow accurate is that survey? Does it accurately survey and represent the entire population? Do those who were part of that survey actually know what Opt-In RBF even means?\r\n\r\n@skajake Any service who already accepts 0-conf transactions will already check for certain things to be sure that the incoming transaction will be confirmed. One of them is the nSequence, and if it is not MAX_INT, then the transaction is non-final. Even if they do not upgrade, this code is already there because an nSequence that is not MAX_INT is already considered non-final and thus dangerous to accept 0-conf on. Thus that is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nAlso, if they only accept transactions with confirmations (as many do), then this doesn't matter to the retailer.",

I believe this change could reduce the usefulness of RBF.\r\n\r\nI fail to understand the support for this change. RBF does not harm nodes or miners, at all. It makes sense for them to choose to disable it by personal preference as someone who doesn't know or care about RBF wouldn't be affected in the slightest.\r\n\r\nWallets regardless of this change will have to still be safe, and educate about 0-conf and RBF. This change does nothing but hurt RBF, and doesn't seem to benefit anyone.",

The last thing we should be doing is making it harder it scarier for businesses to interact with or accept Bitcoin transactions. Of course someone with @petertodds level of skill can double spend, but businesses accept risk of counteroffer money being used for purchases but governments aren't making a huge issue about it so they self regulate those risks. If the news cycle were to suddenly start talking about the potential risks for accepting cash if would cause China's and confusion. Just as RBF is doing. \r\n\r\nThis is bad for Bitcoin and having this turned on as a default is bad for Bitcoin. \r\n\r\nDid devs talk to merchants about this. Because a lot of people in the retail space think this is horrible.",
