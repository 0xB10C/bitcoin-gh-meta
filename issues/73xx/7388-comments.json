I do however think this due to a misunderstanding:\r\n* It's perfectly possible to keep accepting 0-conf transactions, if you believe they are safe for your use case. Opt-in RBF sets a non-maximum nSequence value, which causes many providers to already consider the transaction non-standard for the purpose of accepting 0-conf.\r\n* As a customer, you can choose to set opt-in RBF, and thus lose the ability to get your payment accepted before confirmation, but with the ability to easily change the fee afterwards or combine the transaction with others.\r\n* As a miner, the rational behaviour is to take the transaction with the highest fee (even for non opt-in cases). If you don't, another miner can.\r\n\r\nAnd, no, opt-in RBF is not theft. It's indicating that you're not sure whether what you're submitting is the final form of the transaction. This is the exact semantics that nSequence had since the earliest version of Bitcoin.\r\n",

That would be possible.\r\n\r\nBut most (all) wallets do already treat unconfirmed transactions/balance as **unconfirmed**. People should really not rely on **unconfirmed** balance. It's **unconfirmed**. ~~As recently shown by Peter Todd, it's quite easy to double spend your transaction, and this was without RBF being deployed.~~ If they rely on 0-conf they should use a merchant tools which includes risk analysis. \r\n\r\nIf you are selling services or goods after you have received a 0-conf transaction, you should be very careful with handing out the good/service while the transaction is **not confirmed** and you should certainly not use a standard wallet (you would take a very high risk).

A wallet user is a financial actor.  The question is not whether they will spend those particular received bitcoins, but what actions they will or may take on the receipt of those bitcoins.  At the ery minimum the wallet GUI should expose whether the transaction (or one of its ancestors) was opted in - this functionality shouldn't be limited just to RPC IMHO.",
