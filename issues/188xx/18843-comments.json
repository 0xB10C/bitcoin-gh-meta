I considered it would be ok as long as it is a separate commit and the main change in this PR steps on top of it. Now I submitted that dedup as a separate PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18857, removed it from this PR and made this PR to use the old `AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG()` so that there is no dependency between the two PRs and either one can be merged first. As a result they conflict but it is trivial to resolve - once one of them gets merged (if that happens!) I will adjust the other one.\r\n \r\n> > r1 would be set to 0 on rdrand failure, so initializing it to 0 is a non-functional change.\r\n> \r\n> Can you at least link to documentation that says this is the case.\r\n\r\nDone in the commit message:\r\n\r\n> From \"Intel 64 and IA-32 ArchitecturesSoftware Developer's Manual\" [1],\r\n> page 1711: \"CF=1 indicates that the data in the destination is valid.\r\n> Otherwise CF=0 and the data in the destination operand will be returned\r\n> as zeros for the specified width.\"\r\n> \r\n> [1] https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/39/c5/325462-sdm-vol-1-2abcd-3abcd.pdf\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this!",
