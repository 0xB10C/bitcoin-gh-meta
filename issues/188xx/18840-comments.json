      "body" : "I think the description of this change is misleading. With this change the wallet isn't just waiting to \"fuly process previous RPCs\" it's also waiting for the node to process it's own internal events, and is waiting for other external listeners like the GUI, the transaction index, p2p networking code, and other wallets that are loaded.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure if the change reliably fixes the reported problem, or just fixes it by accidentally by adding a delay. How does SyncWithValidationInterfaceQueue() ensure the new transaction is added to the mempool? And could there be a more direct fix for the `abandontransaction` error like having `bumpfee` update the old transaction's `fInMempool` flag directly after the new transaction is added?",
