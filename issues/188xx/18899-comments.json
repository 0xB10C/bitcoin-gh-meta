If someone suggests a change and the author pushes it, then the ci should run quickly so reviewers don't feel blocked.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to have a valgrind run with just the unit tests, and perhaps a basic functional test, as long as that could be done in a reasonable time. I also think it'd be worthwhile doing a full valgrind test on nightly builds somewhere.",
