If someone suggests a change and the author pushes it, then the ci should run quickly so reviewers don't feel blocked.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to have a valgrind run with just the unit tests, and perhaps a basic functional test, as long as that could be done in a reasonable time. I also think it'd be worthwhile doing a full valgrind test on nightly builds somewhere.",

I fully support doing valgrind testing, just not for every functional test in every PR.\r\n\r\nThings like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1063656/81233423-a9010600-8fc4-11ea-92cf-117179f93cfe.png)\r\n\r\n(7 hours since I pushed and travis is still pending) mean that I can't make progress on PRs. That branch is failing because of a valgrind timeout in a test, and because iteration is so slow, that PR hasn't made any progress for two days.",
