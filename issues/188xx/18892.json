   "body" : "We make heavy use of sanitizers and memory checkers to catch memory related issues that are inherent to the C++ programming language as early as possible.\r\n\r\nOne example is uninitialized reads. They come in many forms, but one of them is\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nint foo;\r\nif (!Parse(\"-1\", foo)) return\r\nstd::cout << foo << std::endl;  // Can be uninitialized read, depending on implementation of Parse\r\n```\r\n\r\nSometimes programmers initialize `foo` to a constant like `0` or `-1`, but such practice is defeating the whole purpose of memory sanitizers. That is, for a memory sanitizer it is now impossible to detect an uninitialized read.\r\n\r\nHowever, I suspect that no one is running with sanitizers enabled in production and it would be nice to not expose production systems to undefined behaviour. So I was wondering if anyone would object compiling and shipping the release binaries with `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero`?",
