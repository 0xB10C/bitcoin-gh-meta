The entries in setInventoryTxToSend are filtered by filterInventoryKnown, so it won't contain anything we know the other party already knows about. Of course, that filter is limited in size, but with 50000 entries I believe it can't expire entries faster than after 47 minutes (50000 invs / 35 (invs / msg) * (2s / msg) = 2857s), long after the entries are gone from the relay map (from which they expire after 15 minutes).\r\n\r\nIn other words: this is worrying about the situation where (a) you announced an INV (b) at least 47 minutes passed, during which you respond to a BIP35 mempool request from the peer (c) you try to rebroadcast (d) in the few seconds after the rebroadcast is scheduled but before it's sent out, you receive a GETDATA.",

I agree with @amitiuttarwar that the PR description is confusing (you switch the perspective of 'we' being the node sending the GETDATA and 'we' being the node receiving it). PR descriptions end up in the merge commit, so it'd be good to fix that up.\r\n\r\nI think that rather than adding another bool to the already complex `ProcessGetData` which only exists to skip over a code block, it'd be clearer to refactor the getdata tx processing into its own function. That turns your change into a two line fix.\r\n\r\nI've done that here: https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/tree/pr18861.1. Feel free to use it if you think it's useful.\r\n\r\n(The function signature for `ProcessGetTransactionData()` isn't great, and I'd prefer to send individual NOTFOUND messages within that function instead of batching them, but that's no longer a pure refactor and could be done later.)",

How rare? Here are some stats from my node's first two peers:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> bcli getpeerinfo\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 0,\r\n    [...]\r\n    \"bytessent_per_msg\": {\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"notfound\": 122,\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"tx\": 212229,\r\n    },\r\n    \"bytesrecv_per_msg\": {\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"notfound\": 427,\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"tx\": 31755274,\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 1,\r\n    [...]\r\n    \"bytessent_per_msg\": {\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"notfound\": 1098,\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"tx\": 108708,\r\n    },\r\n    \"bytesrecv_per_msg\": {\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"notfound\": 926,\r\n      [...]\r\n      \"tx\": 93436726,\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlmost all notfound messages are 61 bytes (24 bytes header + 37 bytes data). Let's assume that an average tx message is 250 bytes for header+data.\r\n\r\nThat means for my first two peers I sent/received ~42 notfound messages and sent/received ~500,000 tx messages.\r\n\r\nLooking through my debug logs, the vast majority of notfound messages are 37 bytes, indicating a single item. So, for almost all calls of ProcessGetData(), there are zero or one notfound items, and batching has no effect on wire efficiency. Batching notfounds would save <100 messages per day for me (run `grep \"sending notfound\" .bitcoin/debug.log | grep -v \"37 bytes\"` to see for yourself).\r\n\r\nIn the adversarial case, it's more expensive for us to serve transactions than notfounds, so being more efficient doesn't protect us from any attacks.\r\n\r\nSending notfounds individually also has the nice effect of making getdata responses serial in the order we received them.\r\n\r\n> How about [...] a helper function [...] that just returns true or false\r\n\r\nI think that's better than the status quo, but I prefer delgating out to a function to do all the transaction GETDATA processing and message sending, so that it matches the responsibilities of ProcessGetBlockData() exactly.",
