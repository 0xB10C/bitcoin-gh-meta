I'll split off commits into smaller PRs for merge.\r\n\r\nThe original PR has already received a lot of review, so I think it should be possible to get this merged over the next few weeks. I think the following plan is manageable:\r\n\r\n| Functionality | Commits | PR | Target merge date | Actual merge date |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Serve cfcheckpt requests | _[init] Add -peercfilters option_, _[net processing] Message handling for getcfcheckpt._, _[test] Add test for cfcheckpt_ | #18877 | 2020-05-13 | x |\r\n| Cache cfcheckpt headers | _[net processing] Cache compact filter checkpoints in memory._ | x | 2020-05-20 | x |\r\n| Serve cfheaders requests | _[net processing] Message handling for getcfheaders._, _[test] Add test for cfheaders_ | x | 2020-05-27 | x |\r\n| Serve cfilters requests | _[indexes] Fix default [de]serialization of BlockFilter._, _[net processing] Message handling for getcfilters._, _[test] Add test for cfilters._ | x | 2020-06-03 | x |\r\n| Signal NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS support | _[net] Signal NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS if we're serving compact filters._, _[test] Add test for NODE_COMPACT_FILTER._ | x | 2020-06-10 | x |",
