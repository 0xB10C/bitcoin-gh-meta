   "body" : "When the valgrind run was added, it took 2 hours. Travis kindly raised the timeout limit to the maximum possible of 3 hours.\r\n\r\nToday, a full build of Bitcoin Core with all tests takes more than three hours. Thus, it is impossible to run all tests on travis.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the feedback loop for developers that create a pull request takes at least 2 hours, but in some cases (when the travis queue is full) until the next day. This is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nFix both issues by removing the build from travis.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the `ci/test/` configurations are *not* removed. They will stay in the repo and can be executed anywhere (just not on travis).",
