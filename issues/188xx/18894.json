Two main differences are:\r\n - scope reduced - no unnecessary changes unrelated to the fix;\r\n - approach taken - coin control instance now belongs to the send view.\r\n\r\nAll problems raised in #17457 reviews no longer apply due to the approach taken - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17457#pullrequestreview-319297589 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17457#issuecomment-555920829)\r\n\r\nNo change in behavior if only one wallet is loaded.\r\n\r\nCloses #15725.",
