   "body" : "This PR removes a potential circular dependency that was discovered in travis while building binaries for this PR https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18827\r\n\r\nThe affected sources/includes are _httprpc_ and _rpc/server_\r\n\r\nMy first \"solution\" was a _forward declare_ of a single function in _rpc/server.cpp_. However, that merely defeats the linter and could not count as a proper solution.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18827#pullrequestreview-404116986 I tried to extract certain classes and function declarations into a new include file, _rpc/interfaces.h_\r\n\r\nNow, the circular dependency in that PR is gone, but as this constitutes a much bigger change than the PR wanted to make, I think it should better get its own PR.\r\n\r\nThe following classes and function got moved:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nclass RPCTimerBase\r\nclass RPCTimerInterface\r\nclass CRPCCommand\r\nclass CRPCTable\r\nstd::string JSONRPCExecBatch(const JSONRPCRequest& jreq, const UniValue& vReq);\r\nvoid RPCSetTimerInterface(RPCTimerInterface *iface);\r\nvoid RPCSetTimerInterfaceIfUnset(RPCTimerInterface *iface);\r\nvoid RPCUnsetTimerInterface(RPCTimerInterface *iface);\r\n```",
