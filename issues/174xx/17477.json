   "body" : "Builds on #14384. Please review that PR first.\r\n\r\nThese boost signals were added in #9371, before we had an asynchronous validation interface. The `NotifyEntryAdded` callback was used by validation to build a vector of conflicted transactions when connecting a block, which the wallet was notified of in the `BlockConnected` CValidationInterface callback.\r\n\r\nNow that we have an asynchronous `TransactionRemovedFromMempool` callback, we can fire that signal directly from the mempool for conflicted transactions without having to worry about the performance impact of sync'ing wallet transactions during block connection.",
