      "body" : "> It let call `sethseed` while being disconnected, which may be blameworthty but as `createwallet` let you already generate a HD wallet without checking for IBD, we should go either way or the other, i.e can generate HD-seed without out-of-IBD or can't generate HD-seed without out-of-IBD. Thoughts ?\r\n\r\nThe reason that you had to be out of IBD in order to set an HD seed is because by setting a new HD seed, no new keys would ever be generated from the old seed. So if there were a transaction that involved a key that hadn't been generated yet and was in a block after where you were currently synced, setting a new HD seed would mean that you don't detect that transaction. That would be bad.\r\n\r\nWith `createwallet`, the difference is that it's a completely new wallet with no history at all so it is safe to make a new wallet when you are behind.\r\n",
