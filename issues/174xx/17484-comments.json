Thoughts ?\r\n\r\nThe reason that you had to be out of IBD in order to set an HD seed is because by setting a new HD seed, no new keys would ever be generated from the old seed. So if there were a transaction that involved a key that hadn't been generated yet and was in a block after where you were currently synced, setting a new HD seed would mean that you don't detect that transaction. That would be bad.\r\n\r\nWith `createwallet`, the difference is that it's a completely new wallet with no history at all so it is safe to make a new wallet when you are behind.\r\n",

Any key that has already been derived and added to the wallet (i.e. it was in the keypool or already marked as used) will still be checked for. Setting a new seed doesn't change that. Setting a new seed only makes it so that no new keys will be derived from the old seed.\r\n\r\n> Node is getting out of IBD at tip N - DEFAULT_TIP_AGE(~144), which means you can set a new seed at N - 144, but you're not going to see a tx with an old key in block N - 100 for example, so is this mechanism reliable ?\r\n\r\nI think it's reasonably reliable as I think it is unlikely that someone used the entire keypool in 144 blocks.",
