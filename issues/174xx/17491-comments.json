More user control over the automatic Tor hidden service would be useful.\r\n\r\nSay, a button to generate a new hidden service.\r\n\r\nThough, specifically, I'm interested in why you'd want to create a new hidden service *every launch*.  The gossip process is slow, and it will take ages for other peers to find you and connect to you again. By that time you've already moved on. How I see it, you might as well just disable incoming connections.",
