But from the above it sounds to me that the motivation for this sort of thing is largely misguided.\r\n\r\nHaving a per-session HS would be pointless-- it would get no or essentially no connections, and it would waste network resources rumoring useless addresses and attempting to connect to them.  It is also unnecessary: Bitcoin works perfectly fine over tor without creating _any_ HS or accepting incoming connections-- and this is generally the most private way to use it.\r\n\r\nBitcoin also does not do a particularly complete job of preventing a given host from being tracked across different identities-- e.g. the content of your addrman database will usually uniquely identify you (particularly if an attacker does some work to tag your state), similarly the mempool can be abused in this manner too using slow to confirm transactions.  The swapping from one identity to another would also create a temporal signal (X stops, Y starts at the same time) which could be used to trace the user.\r\n\r\nHaving short lived pseudonymous identities is with some respect the worse of all worlds-- not getting additional inbound connectivity, not providing a useful service to the network,  wasting rumour/connect resources, and still leaking information that could be used by an attacker to continually stay connected to a particular target.\r\n\r\nFor different protocols where inbound connections are important the considerations might be entirely different.\r\n\r\nEdit:  After some reflection I guessed that maybe people are trying to imitate the new-identity button in torbrowser. If so: bitcoin already makes every single connection with new circuits, so nothing is needed there.\r\n",
