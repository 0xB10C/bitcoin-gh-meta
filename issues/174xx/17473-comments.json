Is [bcf8060](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/bcf8060557d544fa881be9e74c2e108189010dca) really necessary, not sure the motivation of it.\r\n\r\nAs the commit message says, some of the flags are incorrectly applied and cause tests to fail when type checking is actually implemented in #16545. At first I tried to selectively update the flags instead of using a scripted diff, but as I was iterating on #16545 more of these old tests kept failing and I kept going back and forth on the flags. I think bottom line is these tests were never written to interact with flags, and I have much better dedicated tests for the flags in #16545. I doubt #16545 will be the last PR changing these flags, and I want to avoid old tests becoming a maintenance burden for more flag changes in the future.\r\n\r\nReason for including the commit in this PR instead of delaying it for the future, is that right now the tests are misleading and make it look like unused unimplemented constants could actually have an effect.",
