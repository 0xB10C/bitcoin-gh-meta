UTXO snapshot\r\nactivation is one such case, as we populate `cacheCoins` with the snapshot\r\ncontents and want to persist immediately afterwards but also enter IBD.\r\n\r\nSee also #15265, which makes the case that under normal operation a\r\nflush-without-erase doesn't necessarily add much benefit. I open this PR\r\neven in light of the previous discussion because (i) flush-without-erase\r\nalmost certainly provides benefit in the case of snapshot activation (especially\r\non spinning disk hardware) and (ii) this diff is fairly small and gives us convenient \r\noptions for more granular cache management without changing existing policy. \r\n\r\nSee also #15218.
