While its somewhat of a shame to make block-validation-logic generate a list of mempool changes to be included in its generated callbacks, fixing this isnt too hard.'\r\n\r\n@morcos - you attempted something similar in #9240",

So arguably there's a window condition in the existing code where the wallet might try to spend change that it thinks is in the mempool, but is actually conflicted with the latest block (although in practice this doesn't matter - it's always the case that there might be a better block that conflicts our transactions that we just don't know about yet).\r\n\r\n(If this PR was changing the way we notify the wallet about transactions removed from the mempool because they're included in a block, then I'd agree with you. We don't want to introduce a window where the wallet knows the transaction is no longer in the mempool but doesn't yet know that it's in a block.)",
