Bitcoin Core has never been leading in these kind of prescriptive language changes (same for the units discussion, like what unit people *should* be using), and IMO, shouldn't. If it gains traction we'll want to update the GUI.\r\n\r\nChanging RPC command names for this seems unnecessary disruption. We already had the `account`â`label` change recently. Let's not do one immediate againâ¦ these kind of changes are disruptive for projects such as joinmarket which rely on our API.\r\n",
