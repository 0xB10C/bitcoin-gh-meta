Long timeouts which return early are OK, but short-er timeouts which always wait for the whole timeout are riskier IMO especially when we don't control the runtime.\r\n2) The test doesn't check that the descendants limit is actually enforced, e.g., that MAX_CUSTOM_DESCDENDANTS+1 is *not* in the mempool\r\n3) The Lightning carve out should also get a test, but doesn't need to be here.",
