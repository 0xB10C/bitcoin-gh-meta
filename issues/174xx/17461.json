   "body" : "This is a follow-up PR to #17435, testing the custom descendant limit, passed by the argument `-limitdescendantcount`. It was more tricky than expected, mainly because we don't know for sure at which point node1 has got all the transactions broadcasted from node0 (for the ancestor test this wasn't a problem since the txs were immediately available through `invalidateblock`) -- a simple `sync_mempools()` doesn't work here since the mempool contents are not equal due to different ancestor/descendant limits. Hence I came up with a \"hacky manual sync\":\r\n1. wait until the mempool has the _expected_ tx count (see conditions below)\r\n2. after that, wait some time and get sure that the mempool contents haven't changed in-between\r\n\r\nLike for the ancestor test, we overall check for three conditions:\r\n- the # of txs in the node1 mempool is equal to the the descendant limit (plus 1 for the parent tx, plus the # txs from the previous ancestor test which are still in) (done by the hacky sync above)\r\n- all txs in node1 mempool are a subset of txs in node0 mempool\r\n- part of the constructed descendant-chain (the first ones up to the limit) are contained in node1 mempool",
