Does that satisfy the concern about rapid reconnects?  I guess if a user rapidly restarted their node, we could see rapid connections to the same peers, but that seems pretty weird.\r\n\r\nAnyway I just skimmed the discussion in #17326.  I think Greg or Matt commented that we shouldnât do this with all our block-relay-only connections, but since we only have 2 at the moment, perhaps itâs fine for now.  And then in the future if we expand to say 8 block-relay peers we might still cap the anchors at 2.  Does that reflect the thinking of others as well?",
