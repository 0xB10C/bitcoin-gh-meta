      "body" : "In the RPC I think the requirement to specify the address is a nuisance Ã¢ÂÂ esp in cases where there simply wouldn't be an opportunity to social engineerÃ¢ÂÂ e.g. where the address is itself the relevant 'account'... and I wouldn't be sad to see that feature go.  In the GUI OTOH I tend to agree.\n\nPerhaps make the verify box an input field, and if it's correct it instead tells you what the address should have been in the sorry you lose box?   This way use case that don't need to know the address in advance can still get it, but users are still encouraged to let the machine do the comparison.",
