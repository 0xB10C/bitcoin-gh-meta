It was there the last time I built from your same branch.\n\nI can't see what you've changed because it appears that you've overwritten the previous commit with the new one.\n\nRemember when @Diapolo said:\n\n\"can we work with seperate commits until we are final? It's impossible to track changes when it's rebased all the time\"\n\nand you replied:\n\n\"I suppose separate commits makes sense for this one...\"\n\nand I thought that meant we'd be using separate commits for this one?",
