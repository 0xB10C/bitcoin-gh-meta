Connecting through Tor 50% of the times annihilates 100% of that hard won privacy. \n\nYou seem to have routing issues with your network. Fix these, or use a load-balancing proxy or VPN to work around it. But don't try to fix this in bitcoin.\n\nThis option is only confusing. NACK.\n",

Would you be willing to let me know of the software that does this?\n\nI think it's a simple enough change, and I agree that a minority of people will use it. Would it be more agreeable if the proxytoo option was not mentioned in the syntax output?",
