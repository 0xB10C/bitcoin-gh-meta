Then you can have your master branch follow the master of each repo and set up topic branches off master.\r\n\r\n> While making the changes I realized it requires manually doing it carefully. So not sure if it could have been done with script.\r\n\r\nUnless I am missing something this is a find and replace which can be done using a scripted-diff. I don't think this will be merged without a scripted-diff but someone more experienced can correct me if I am wrong.\r\n\r\n> I will keep the things in mind while submitting a PR in future, let me know if this needs changes/closure or can be merged.\r\n\r\nAs I said I don't think this will be merged as is.
