This PR replaces the custom text file mechanism with the new manifest approach.\r\n\r\nIt is planned that vckpg manifests will include the ability to version dependencies in the future. Dependency versions would solve a number of issues that currently require workarounds with the appveyor CI.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
