      "body" : "Thanks for the clear bug report! Agree this behavior is not good. I tend to think a simpler fix would be to just disallow relative -conf paths entirely, making specifying any relative -conf path an error, instead of interpreting relative -conf paths differently depending on the source of the -conf value (command line vs config file vs settings.json).\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of making specifying a relative -conf paths an error instead of changing the interpretation would be that that if someone is relying on current behavior and upgrades they can encounter an explicit error instead of a subtly broken configuration.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is too extreme though? @brianddk maybe you had a use-case for specifying a relative path instead of an absolute path?\r\n\r\nA compromise option instead of forbidding relative -conf paths outright, or interpretting relative -conf paths differently depending on where they are specified might be to only forbid relative -conf paths when a -datadir value is specified.",
