      "body" : "Code review ACK df7a0ab34606c6203eb53ff4061f656293ab0f7f. Code change looks fine, but I think this is a bad approach for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- The approach is more complicated than it needs to be. There is no need to have a macro-wrapped fake lock class just to assert a mutex is locked. The ASSERT_CAPABILITY annotation literally exists for this purpose. If you have a can of beans, I'm sure you can probably open it with a hammer and screwdriver, but you are probably better off using the can opener.\r\n\r\n- This is introducing a new macro to do what clang developers specifically told us [not to do](https://reviews.llvm.org/D87629#2272676): \"please don't use [ACQUIRE](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#acquire-acquire-shared-release-release-shared-release-generic) when the capability is assumed to be held previously\"\r\n\r\n- This change makes LOCK_ASSERTION look like safer alternative to AssertLockHeld when actually it more dangerous (it is not checked at compile time unlike AssertLockHeld). It would be nice if the naming could give an indication of which assert should be preferred. (Of course we can get rid of two asserts with #19865).\r\n\r\n- Unclear why it's called a \"quick fix\". It's basically the same size as #19918 except it has fewer comments and an incomplete description with no stated rationale",
