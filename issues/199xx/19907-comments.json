It's impossible to know if the user just needs to sign again or combine. Having `COMBINE` could be confusing to users if they are in the processing of signing, whereas having `SIGNER` is clear that signing still needs to take place.\r\n\r\nMaybe just an addition to `need_sig_text` to say that the sigs can come from combining PSBTs would be a better option.",

Because if the combiner role is missed from the code, while mentioned in the docs, it is also confusing (I was confused when I was studying PSBT implementation where it has gone). And, then, we can adjust the message as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's not clear to me who to classify the situation where _some_ (but not all) signatures are present? With what you have wrote, this could happen when a user started adding signatures in sequential mode, but has not completed this process, i.e. when (s)he is signer - and also with a parallel process when (s)he is combiner. If this is true, I propose to change the current implementation to match this logic (right now it was that the signer role is detected only when none of the signatures are present, otherwise the user classified as updater, which is incorrect).",
