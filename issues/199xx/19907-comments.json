Everything that can be parallelized and thus involves combiner can also be done serially without combiner. You can't know whether the user is doing a parallel process or a serial process.",

      "body" : "Concept NACK\r\n\r\nAs @achow101 points out, this is only adding `COMBINER` to `analyzepsbt` which doesn't make sense imo. It's impossible to know if the user just needs to sign again or combine. Having `COMBINE` could be confusing to users if they are in the processing of signing, whereas having `SIGNER` is clear that signing still needs to take place.\r\n\r\nMaybe just an addition to `need_sig_text` to say that the sigs can come from combining PSBTs would be a better option.",
