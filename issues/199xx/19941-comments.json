Those characteristics are good too.\r\n\r\nI would suggest some additions.\r\n\r\n- PR opened by a (semi-) experienced reviewer (e.g. @fjahr, @pinheadmz) who can provide guidance on how to review the PR in the initial comment and answer questions. I don't know if a good first issue PR/new contributor's PR is a good candidate for this.\r\n- PRs that people won't mind being noisier in the comments than most.\r\n- PRs that can be left open for a sufficient time to give new reviewers time on them before being merged. Any PRs that are urgent or holding up other PRs being merged are obviously not good candidates for this.\r\n\r\n",
