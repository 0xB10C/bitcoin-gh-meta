But after a crash the node says it doesn't have that node. I then send a getblockchaininfo to the node and realize that it has less blocks than my database (2 blocks the time I did it but sometimes more blocks).\r\n\r\nAs my node is regtest, no other node sends the missing block so I am forced to delete the last blocks from my database (which is left in an inconsisten state with invalid transactions).\r\n\r\nWhere could I find node logs?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
