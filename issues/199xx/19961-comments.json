If you want to run a dual stack, reachable\n-\t                from both Tor and IPv4 (or IPv6), you'll need to either pass your\n-\t                other addresses using -externalip, or explicitly enable -discover.\n-\t                Note that both addresses of a dual-stack system may be easily\n-\t                linkable using traffic analysis.\n+    -externalip=X   You can tell bitcoin about its publicly reachable addresses\n+                    using this option, and this can be a .onion address. Given\n+                    the above configuration, you can find your .onion address in\n+                    /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/hostname. For connections",

My concern is that the doc doesn't really help the most common end users.  \r\n\r\n> Connecting to Tor's control socket API requires one of two authentication methods to be configured. It also requires the control socket to be enabled, e.g. put ControlPort 9051 in torrc config file. For cookie authentication the user running bitcoind must have read access to the CookieAuthFile specified in Tor configuration.\r\n\r\nThis is nonsense/scary to most people. This ultimately means that most users either don't end up enabling Hidden Services, or have to go to other websites/tutorials to do so (which could be giving them wrong information).  I think our docs could do a much better job explaining to the layperson how to do so.",

Automatically listen on Tor\n \n-Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket\n-API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' onion services programmatically.\n-Bitcoin Core has been updated to make use of this.\n-\n-This means that if Tor is running (and proper authentication has been configured),\n-Bitcoin Core automatically creates an onion service to listen on. This will positively\n-affect the number of available .onion nodes.\n-\n-This new feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening (`-listen`), and\n-requires a Tor connection to work. It can be explicitly disabled with `-listenonion=0`\n-and, if not disabled, configured using the `-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings.\n-To show verbose debugging information, pass `-debug=tor`.\n-\n-Connecting to Tor's control socket API requires one of two authentication methods to be\n-configured. It also requires the control socket to be enabled, e.g. put `ControlPort 9051`\n-in `torrc` config file. For cookie authentication the user running bitcoind must have read\n-access to the `CookieAuthFile` specified in Tor configuration. In some cases this is\n-preconfigured and the creation of an onion service is automatic. If permission problems\n-are seen with `-debug=tor` they can be resolved by adding both the user running Tor and\n-the user running bitcoind to the same group and setting permissions appropriately. On\n-Debian-based systems the user running bitcoind can be added to the debian-tor group,\n-which has the appropriate permissions. Before starting bitcoind you will need to re-login\n-to allow debian-tor group to be applied. Otherwise you will see the following notice: \"tor:\n-Authentication cookie /run/tor/control.authcookie could not be opened (check permissions)\"\n-on debug.log.\n-\n-An alternative authentication method is the use\n-of the `-torpassword=password` option. The `password` is the clear text form that\n-was used when generating the hashed password for the `HashedControlPassword` option\n-in the tor configuration file. The hashed password can be obtained with the command\n-`tor --hash-password password` (read the tor manual for more details).\n+Since Tor version 0.2.7.1, Bitcoin Core makes use of Tor's control socket API to\n+create and destroy ephemeral onion services programmatically.\n+\n+This means that if Tor is running and proper authentication has been configured,\n+Bitcoin Core automatically creates an onion service to listen on. The goal is to\n+increase the number of available onion nodes.\n+\n+This feature is enabled by default if Bitcoin Core is listening (`-listen`) and\n+it requires a Tor connection to work.
