If you want to run a dual stack, reachable\n-\t                from both Tor and IPv4 (or IPv6), you'll need to either pass your\n-\t                other addresses using -externalip, or explicitly enable -discover.\n-\t                Note that both addresses of a dual-stack system may be easily\n-\t                linkable using traffic analysis.\n+    -externalip=X   You can tell bitcoin about its publicly reachable addresses\n+                    using this option, and this can be a .onion address. Given\n+                    the above configuration, you can find your .onion address in\n+                    /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/hostname. For connections",

My concern is that the doc doesn't really help the most common end users.  \r\n\r\n> Connecting to Tor's control socket API requires one of two authentication methods to be configured. It also requires the control socket to be enabled, e.g. put ControlPort 9051 in torrc config file. For cookie authentication the user running bitcoind must have read access to the CookieAuthFile specified in Tor configuration.\r\n\r\nThis is nonsense/scary to most people. This ultimately means that most users either don't end up enabling Hidden Services, or have to go to other websites/tutorials to do so (which could be giving them wrong information).  I think our docs could do a much better job explaining to the layperson how to do so.",
