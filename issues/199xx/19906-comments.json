But instead, when a timer hits, we might connect to a tried address (from tried collisions), instead of a feeler. And the next feeler will be attempted after 2 more minutes.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's exploitable: an attacker can't force us to do this all the time. It's just currently logically incorrect.",
