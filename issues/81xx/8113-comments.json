      "body" : "Yes, agreed. Maybe that's a future possibility after the net refactor. IMO the most important privacy invariant for DNS changes is that we don't ever do DNS queries when `-dns=0` is set. Would be nice to have an auto test of some kind for that.\r\n\r\nIn any case that's a tangent. I think #8097 was nice in that it was only a local change to an (apparently rarely used) RPC call. This involves some regression risk for code outside that as well. On the other hand this is a more thorough solution, and at least one person (@thebluematt) cares about the functionality it seems better to do that.\r\n\r\n@theuni can you take a look?\r\n",
