      "body" : "I agree that it's complicated to a display a appropriate signing-verification (on a hardware wallet screen or similar) by just having the raw transaction. You only know which outputs are controller by the HWW and you cannot calculate the fees. An MITM attack could Ã¢ÂÂ in theory Ã¢ÂÂ make you pay insane fees and there is currently no way (with one of the current available hardware wallets [Ledger/Trezor/Keep-Key/etc.]) to avoid this possible attack.\r\n\r\nImplementing something like `SIGHASH_WITHINPUTVALUE` (soft fork or hard fork version) is not the right way IMO. It's to invasive on the protocol level.\r\nA hardware wallet always needs a controller software a.k.a. a watch-only-wallet. Maybe there are other ways of providing a prove to the HWW that can be used to verify the input amounts (=calculating the fees).",
