They're tests of the number implementation used in script, which long ago used OpenSSL but does no more.\r\n\r\nI agree these could be removed, today the only value they provide is additional chances of catching our implementation changing between versions. If they did turn up a disagreement with the current code now and OpenSSL, we'd ignore it: I don't believe the openssl based code is in widespread use on the network anymore. This would be better handled by copying an implementation (like wumpus says, 0.10's) into the tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
