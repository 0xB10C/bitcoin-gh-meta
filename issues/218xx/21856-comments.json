I found that most bugs fall into one of the categories:\r\n* Silent merge conflict (forgetting to update the fuzz target after code changes)\r\n* A bug in the fuzz target itself\r\n* A recently introduced critical (exploitable) bug, but only present in the `master` main developement branch\r\n* A minor (non-exploitable) bug, potentially present in previous releases\r\n\r\nI believe none of the previously found bugs would warrant an extended disclosure timeline. However, it is not possible to exclude that such a bug may be found. For the hopefully extremely rare case, we may opt to hide a bug report for longer than 90 days. See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/739#issuecomment-614831028 for an example where a longer deadline would be needed.",
