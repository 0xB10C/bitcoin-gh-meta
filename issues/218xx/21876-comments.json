      "body" : "> What would this feature be used for? Why would you want to broadcast a transaction to one specific peer and not other peers?\r\n\r\nPrivacy: Ensure that your transactions cannot be linked to your IP address\r\nFreedom: Users will have more control over the peers selected for broadcasting a transaction.\r\n\r\nThere can be different setups a user or any open source wallet using Bitcoin Core in the backend might want to try for broadcasting transactions. \r\n\r\nTwo examples:\r\n\r\n1. User checks outbound connections and randomly select 1-2 peers for each transaction while broadcasting. If the node has 8 outbound connections, 2 out of 8 are spy nodes, they wont know about each transaction broadcasted.\r\n2. User wants to create a setup similar to [Dandelion](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/building-on-bitcoin/2018/dandelion/) with short stem and guard node like Tor. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/117567673-bcb0e200-b0da-11eb-9a71-0a32ca8b179b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n`A`: Node used by Alice regularly for broadcasting transactions\r\n`B`: Another node managed by Alice\r\n`C`: Random node in Bitcoin peer to peer network\r\n\r\n_Assume we also have two options in `bitcoin.conf`. One can be used to save addresses for nodes that will used for broadcasting transactions, so we don't mention it for every transaction. Other option to randomly select one peer from outbound connections for broadcasting._ \r\n\r\nSetup 1: Node `A` broadcasts all transactions to only `B`. Node `B` randomly selects one peer from outbound connections to relay this transaction. Node `C` is using default options to it relays all transactions to all the peers. \r\n\r\nSetup 2: Node `A` broadcasts most of the transactions to `B`. Node `B` works same as `C` in this case and relays all transactions to all peers. \r\n\r\n> Do you know what is used for in libbtc?\r\n\r\nNot sure.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOther alternatives for privacy are Tor and i2p. Only 20% nodes use Tor according to [Bitnodes](https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/?days=365) and i2p support is recently merged. I don't expect 100% usage of Tor/i2p ever and few ipv4/ipv6 nodes should exist for reasons mentioned in [docs/tor.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6bf33db373588582c85ee537cd5e9302c593cb02/doc/tor.md#4-privacy-recommendations). Not sure [Dandelion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20203) will be implemented in Bitcoin so adding such option can only help in improving privacy for users or making things difficult for spy nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
