The wobbling happens most often when the actual isn't moving much:- \r\n\r\n> 2021-04-30T05:59:05.941 send feefilter WOBBLE 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=110\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:02:07.715 send feefilter WOBBLE 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=56\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:03:33.621 send feefilter WOBBLE 2527 (actual: 2346) peer=110\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:08:49.501 send feefilter WOBBLE 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=98\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:09:21.618 send feefilter WOBBLE 2527 (actual: 2346) peer=76\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:10:31.663 send feefilter WOBBLE 2527 (actual: 2346) peer=88\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:11:43.064 send feefilter WOBBLE 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=88\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:14:01.180 send feefilter WOBBLE 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=81\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:15:41.912 send feefilter WOBBLE 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=110\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:16:39.465 send feefilter WOBBLE 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=76\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:18:14.436 send feefilter WOBBLE 2527 (actual: 2346) peer=87\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:21:56.656 send feefilter WOBBLE 2527 (actual: 2346) peer=81\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:22:31.126 send feefilter 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=114\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:25:48.578 send feefilter WOBBLE 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=87\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:26:08.049 send feefilter WOBBLE 2527 (actual: 2346) peer=88\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:30:05.929 send feefilter WOBBLE 2527 (actual: 2346) peer=78\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:31:18.270 send feefilter WOBBLE 2527 (actual: 2346) peer=98\r\n> 2021-04-30T06:32:56.377 send feefilter WOBBLE 2297 (actual: 2346) peer=78\r\n\r\nI'll edit this comment in a moment to refer to the code I'm using, but the WOBBLE lines are essentially the existing logic, and the non-WOBBLE lines are the new logic. Hopefully you can see that the messages go up and down around the actual, thereby actually revealing the actual more than if this didn't happen.",
