Wait until it has completely\n+shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the\n+installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\n+or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\n+\n+Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is\n+possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old\n+wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.\n+\n+Compatibility\n+==============\n+\n+Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems\n+using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer. Bitcoin\n+Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as\n+frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on\n+unsupported systems.\n+\n+From Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no\n+longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance\n+when macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\n+\n+Notable changes\n+===============\n+\n+Taproot Soft Fork\n+-----------------",
