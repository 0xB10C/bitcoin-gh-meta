Build is clean, only skimmed the code for now.\r\n\r\nIdeas:\r\n- perhaps try displaying the balances before the wallet names, as the balances have a fixed length\r\n- maybe display the connections on one line `connections: in 10, out 10, total 20`...a good opportunity to save on vertical space, as getinfo was previously pruned down due to its output being considered too long\r\n- maybe s/Blockchain/Block chain/ (see https://github.com/bitcoinops/bitcoinops.github.io/blob/master/STYLE.md for a bitcoin writing guide)\r\n- add spaces between words like verificationprogress, relayfee, and timeoffset\r\n- maybe display `\"\"` for the default wallet\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-05-03 12-10-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2415484/116864897-22433100-abf8-11eb-93e4-b7c19ef0fb4b.png)\r\n",
