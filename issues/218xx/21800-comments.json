Treating every transaction in the package as each other's ancestor and descendant is a good, conservative heuristic to use, since it can never underestimate the true number of ancestors/descendants.

Perhaps we can have a regtest-only rawpackage RPC with a `test_accept` parameter (in my opinion users should never have to interact with packages)? And testmempoolaccept can be for users / L2 testing?",
