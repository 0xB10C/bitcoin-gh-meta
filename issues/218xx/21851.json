I've currently taken this from Xcode 12.2.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n- [ ] Qt doesn't work yet. Unclear if it will be trivial to make work with 5.12.x.\r\n- [ ] I don't have hardware to actually test the binaries. Some I compiled earlier are [available here](https://github.com/fanquake/build_artifacts/releases/tag/m1_test).",
