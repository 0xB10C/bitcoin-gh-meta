   "body" : "After live-demo-ing a Guix build (which completed successfully!) on achow101's stream, I realized there were a few quality of life improvements which can be made to improve the user experience of our Guix build process. Here are a few of them.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n1. When `MAX_JOBS` is specified, both `guix time-machine` and `guix environment` will now build up to `MAX_JOBS` packages at a time when creating the build environment\r\n2. The instructions for using substitutes were incorrect, and has now been replaced with a `SUBSTITUTE_URLS` environment variable, which works well with shell's IFS splitting rules\r\n3. New `ADDITIONAL_GUIX_{COMMON,TIMEMACHINE}_FLAGS` options, for more granular customization of the build process.\r\n4. README cleanup",
