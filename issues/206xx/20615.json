Though for failing tasks, a failure should ideally be shown to the author and reviewer as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nCompute credits can be used to schedule immediately: https://cirrus-ci.org/pricing/#compute-credits. Running all tasks with compute credits will probably be more expensive than our previous CI invoice. However, they are also more flexible.\r\n\r\nAs a start we could enable only a single task and revisit/re-evaluate the next steps in a month.",
