While I think it's helpful for `net_processing` code to be using a more meaningful function name rather than check for nullptr in all these places, it's not entirely clear to me whether it would be best to have the helper function be checking the connection type, or just checking whether `m_tx_relay` is nullptr or not.\r\n\r\nI opted for the latter approach, because right now (nearly) all those nullptr checks are done before dereferencing `m_tx_relay`, so I didn't like the idea of getting rid of the explicit check that the object isn't null.  But if others think that this is not the best way to clean this up, I'm open to suggestions.",
