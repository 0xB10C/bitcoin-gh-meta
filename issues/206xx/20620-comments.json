Descriptors could well start supporting 17-20 key multisig when wrapped in wsh(), without affecting any network policy (also there is no strict reason descriptors can't support nonstandard things too, but I think we want to avoid that if possible).\r\n\r\n@sanket1729 I believe v17-v20 multisig inside P2WSH is standard, as inside P2SH/P2WSH template matching isn't used to determine standardness (otherwise ~all of miniscript would be nonstandard...).",
