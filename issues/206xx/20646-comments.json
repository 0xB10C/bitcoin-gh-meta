If your addrman is populated with those (or with rc3/final/master nodes), you won't have any issues either. The issue #20637 is purely about a vanilla start with empty addrman and the only seed being the node that is run by @ajtowns or @kallewoof (I don't remember). The solution is to update that node, not to introduce more branches in net processing.\r\n\r\nEven if people want to go forward with patching the source code, the current patch is too broad. The only thing changes should be the disconnection, not the way how addrv2 messages are recognized.",
