      "body" : "There are a few things I don't like about this implementation, such as starting the feeCutoff at 0 (instead of 1000 sat/kb).  But I do think an approach like this would work to \"solve\" this problem in 0.10 and 0.11 backports.  The problem with #6673 is there was no limit to how high the fee went, but if its capped at some value that is still potentially reasonable for a min relay fee (like in this pull), then it might be better than just changing a hard coded value.",
