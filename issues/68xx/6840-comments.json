(sounds like it is the same one over and over)\r\n\r\n**edit**: In fact, this takes up most of the first third of your log.\r\nIt also seems to be binding to your local interface instead of your public (which most 'other' nodes seem to be connecting to).\r\n\r\nIs there anything irregular about your set up other than just `bitcoind` on a box?",
