      "body" : "So, you mean the scenario where we have a high fee-rate transaction that is spent by one or more low fee-rate transactions? For instance suppose we have two transactions in our mempool: tx1a, 1KB w/ 1mBTC fee, which is spent by tx2, 10KB w/ 1mBTC fee. We get tx1b, 10KB w/ 2.1mBTC fee. Since the overall feerate of tx1b is higher than tx1a+tx2, it'll be accepted, even though a miner might have rather mined tx1a instead, ignoring tx2 (for now).\r\n\r\nI agree that's less than optimal. If we make the assumption that there's always more demand for blockchain space than supply, it might be reasonable for the replacement logic criteria to be whether or not we're increasing the fee-rate of any subset of the mempool. (while still paying more fees than the replaced transactions)\r\n\r\nWithout taking CPFP into account, you could simply use the same kind of priority heap logic as in CreateNewBlock() on the list of transactions that would be replaced by the new transaction. You'd iterate through the heap from highest priority to lowest, stopping once you had found as many bytes worth of transactions as the candidate replacement. If the fee-rate of the replacement is higher than the fee-rate of those transactions, accept the replacement into the mempool.\r\n\r\nTo take CPFP into account... Thinking about it more the mempool package tracking is probably backwards from what we want. Right now it tracks descendants, when really what we want to know is \"what's the total fee-rate if I mine this transaction, and all ancestors?\" If we kept track of \"packages\" that way, we'd be able to do the comparison by determining if the total fee-rate of the new package created by the replacement is higher than the fee-rates of all the packages invalidated by it. I actually did some work on something along these lines a few years ago, though didn't finish it - the implementation is a lot simpler now that we have strict ancestor limits. (when limiting, just throw away the tx associated with the lowest fee-rate package, which is guaranteed to have no descendants)\r\n\r\nFor now though I'd be inclined to merge this PR as-is, as all the above options are pretty complex. I also don't see any way this code could be used in an DoS attack.",

      "body" : "Right, the distinction between ancestor and descendant package is what I was getting at.\r\n\r\nDescendant packages are I think the right thing to use for mempool limiting.  I don't follow what you're saying about a limiting algorithm that uses fee with ancestors -- it's entirely possible that the worst thing under that sort would have descendants in the mempool.\r\n\r\n(FYI I have a branch that implements [ancestor packages] (https://github.com/sdaftuar/bitcoin/tree/ancestor-tracking).  I might propose merging it at some point if it looks like we can take advantage of it in the mining code, but I'm not ready to advocate that now.)\r\n\r\nAnyway in this code, we are comparing the feerate of the replacing transaction (with uncalculated/unknown fee rate including its ancestors) to an estimate of the feerate of the descendants of all the conflicting transactions.  This strikes me as incorrect on both fronts; by not putting any bounds on the ancestor fee rate, we might be accepting a replacement transaction that is unlikely to confirm anytime soon.  On the other hand, by looking at feerate with children (and overcounting those children, at least in the current implementation), we might be making it so that miners would prefer the original transactions to the replacing one.\r\n\r\nI don't know that either of these issues constitutes an attack, but I do think it's useful to try to help users avoid shooting themselves in the foot, say by accidentally adding an input that is part of a long unconfirmed chain (causing the replacing transaction to be worse), and to give miners code that doesn't require further optimization to do the economically rational thing.\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, how about this:\r\n * Require that any new inputs that show up in the replacing transaction be already confirmed.  In the future, if we do merge something like ancestor package tracking and better mining code, we could update this test appropriately.\r\n * Require that for each entry E in setConflicts, \r\n ```feerate(replacing transaction) > max(feerate of E, feerate of E with descendants)```.  That doesn't completely eliminate the possibility that it could be somehow worse for a miner to accept the new transaction, but it eliminates some degenerate cases (where a high fee rate transaction is dragged down by lower fee rate transactions) and is easy to calculate.",

(after all, I'm writing this patch pro bono)\r\n\r\nAs for your example where it would matter, that'd require wallets that attempted to both get txs to non-RBF miners and RBF miners simultaneously by broadcasting one then the other. It's a good idea, but doing that doesn't yet save you any money due to the rule that replacements must pay >= the fees of the transactions being replaced.",

      "body" : "@jtimon Yeah, it's tricky though, because we reuse allConflicting later in the removal code for performance, and that in turn requires us to hold a lock; the way the code works isn't really modularized yet. That said compared to my previous patch we do at least take advantage of other mempool-related code, CalculateDescendants(), so we're a bit ahead.\r\n\r\nI'd be inclined to leave it as-is right now, and do the refactor later when we add RBF-related code to the wallet and/or RPC - that's when we'll have a better idea of what the refactor should look like and how the refactored code should interact with both uses. For instance, the ability to calculate on demand how expensive it would be to replace a specific transaction would be useful.",
