When loading a\n 0.12 wallet into an older version, it will automatically rescan to avoid\n failed checks.\n \n+BIP65 - CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY\n+---------------------------\n+\n+Previously it was impossible to create a transaction output that was guaranteed\n+to be unspendable until a specific date in the future. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY is a\n+new opcode that allows a script to check if a specific block height or time has\n+been reached, failing the script otherwise. This enables a wide variety of new\n+functionality such as time-locked escrows, secure payment channels, etc.\n+\n+BIP65 implements CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by introducing block version 4, which adds\n+additional restrictions to the NOP2 opcode. The same miner-voting mechanism as\n+in BIP34 and BIP66 is used: when 751 out of a sequence of 1001 blocks have\n+version number 4 or higher, the new consensus rule becomes active for those\n+blocks. When 951 out of a sequence of 1001 blocks have version number 4 or\n+higher, it becomes mandatory for all blocks and blocks with versions less than\n+4 are rejected.\n+\n+Bitcoin Core's block templates are now for version 4 blocks only, and any\n+mining software relying on its `getblocktemplate` must be updated in parallel\n+to use either libblkmaker version FIXME or any version from 0.5.1 onward. If\n+you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade Bitcoin Core,\n+which must be done prior to BIP65 achieving its 951/1001 status.  If you are\n+mining with the stratum mining protocol: this does not affect you.  If you are\n+mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool: this will affect you at\n+the pool operator's discretion, which must be no later than BIP65 achieving its\n+951/1001 status.\n+",
