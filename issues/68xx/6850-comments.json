      "body" : "Just to add some more rationale - at Bittylicious, we have a situation where we sent a transaction involving some unconfirmed change. This will never confirm because the original transaction that generated the change became mutated. Thus, we needed to zapwallettxes in order to remove this transaction and restore balances.\r\n\r\nThe restore process was going to take about 10 hours (wallet and blocks on SSD) on our huge 500 MB wallet. This was too much downtime for Bittylicious. After a lot of difficult profiling, I determined that it was AddToWallet that was taking all the time because of the iteration to find nTimeSmart. When rescanning, we a) just assume this is the block time anyway, and b) restore the metadata for nTimeSmart anyway.\r\n\r\nThis was tested by comparing the wallet from the traditional zapwallettxes (before this commit) to the wallet after this patch. It looks the same based on a random sample of transaction and overall wallet balance.\r\n\r\nI think that this patch should be accepted because this fix:\r\n\r\n 1. Doesn't actually change the logic at all (reviewers should definitely check this)\r\n 2. Is very simple, adding just a simple if statement (essentially)\r\n 3. Has a massive speed improvement when rescanning\r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd look into creating new indices and get rid of OrderedTxItems but that's more invasive, has some other performance impacts, and wouldn't make a huge difference for small wallets.",

If you want to fix that, I agree these aren't mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nI said #6851 is faster, because I actually compared it to the same base with smart times removed entirely (effectively what this would do). I was mainly just asking you to confirm my results on your own wallet. (*Why* it's faster, I'm not really sure - I would guess there's something outside smart times using the ordered wallet.)",
