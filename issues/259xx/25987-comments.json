And it is the\n> right thing to do.\n>\n> SQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE\n> <https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html#omit_shared_cache>\n>\n> Omitting the possibility of using shared cache allows many\n> conditionals in performance-critical sections of the code to be\n> eliminated. This can give a noticeable improvement in performance.\n>\n> Also: https://www.sqlite.org/sharedcache.html\n>\n> Shared-cache mode is an obsolete feature.\n> The use of shared-cache mode is discouraged.\n> Most use cases for shared-cache are better served by WAL mode.\n> Applications that build their own copy of SQLite from source code\n> are encouraged to use the -DSQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE compile-time\n> option, as the resulting binary will be both smaller and faster.\n>\n> SQLITE_OMIT_JSON <https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html#omit_json>\n>\n> Starting with sqlite 3.38.0 the JSON extension became opt-out rather\n> than opt-in, so we disable it here.\n>\n> --disable-rtree\n>\n> An R-Tree is a special index that is designed for doing range queries.\n> R-Trees are most commonly used in geospatial systems...\n> https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html\n>\n> --disable-fts4 --disable-fts5\n>\n> FTS5 is an SQLite virtual table module that provides full-text\n> search functionality to database applications.\n>\n> On my Linux box this results in a libsqlite3.a that shrinks from ~1.7mb\n> to ~1.3mb.\n> On macOS, libsqlite3.a shrinks from ~2.2mb to ~1.3mb.\n> ------------------------------\n> You can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\n>\n>   https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25987\n> Commit Summary\n>\n>    - 24b344e\n>    <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25987/commits/24b344e459162c0aefe69405f88dc3af1d9b9ebd>\n>    build: use more recommended sqlite3 compile options\n>    - 64f4ef0\n>    <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25987/commits/64f4ef037e7eacb7ae264979e20b1a2feb630ba6>\n>    build: pass --enable-debug to sqlite when DEBUG=1\n>\n> File Changes\n>\n> (1 file <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25987/files>)\n>\n>    - *M* depends/packages/sqlite.mk\n>    <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25987/files#diff-9dda0f980cb053a3b18924bd06068bfcbc0a33251a704377266ec78746962419>\n>    (4)\n>\n> Patch Links:\n>\n>    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25987.patch\n>    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25987.diff\n>\n> â\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25987>, or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AVJT5TAOQDITVMOBL7FRCWDV4IUFJANCNFSM6AAAAAAQDNOVWU>\n> .\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.Message\n> ID: ***@***.***>\n>\n",
