      "body" : "Concept ACK\r\n\r\n@MarcoFalke, a bug is a bug, even if it was done on purpose. @jnewbery can clarify here, but I do not think this was even purposeful. My guess is that this breakage was unwanted, but acceptable in order to get the refactor from #21160 done. It later required fixup attempts like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24691 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25176.\r\n\r\nSo, what happened? The `relaytxes` and `minfeefilter` fields were always present, and documented as such, in the output of the `getpeerinfo` RPC. #21160 changed it so that they could sometimes be missing. I guess the issues (both for GUI and RPC) were neglected during the review with a comment like [will almost always be true, so this isn't a big issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21160#discussion_r598567395). Well, it turned out our own tool `bitcoin-cli` broke due to the missing but expected fields. Some user apps will break too (if we don't fix it in 24.0).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24691 documented the fields as optional, but that is not appropriate because in the previous version they were not-optional. When users wrote their apps they assumed the fields will always be present. I think the \"optional\" flag should only be added when a field is initially introduced. Adding it later is the same as dropping the field - it breaks the \"contract\" with the user that the field will be present.\r\n\r\nOn this PR: I think it is ok to display the values `relaytxes=false` and `minfeefilter=0` in those corner cases. This is what the code did before #21160. If this is stripped to the bare minimum needed for the fix, I think it will have higher chance of making it to 24.0",
