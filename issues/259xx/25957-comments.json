      "body" : "Concept ACK\r\n\r\nLimiting the functionality to descriptor wallets is fine. We could add an argument to `loadwallet` that prevents a rescan, so a user can migrate (#19602) to a descriptor wallet and then rescan.\r\n\r\nIs there anything in @jamesob's #23549 you can reuse here?\r\n\r\nThe `rescanwallet` RPC help should mention that having `-blockfilterindex=1` dramatically speeds things up. It might also be good to have log message somewhere that it's using the block filter.\r\n\r\nI tried a rescan from genesis on a simple mainnet wallet. It was blazing fast (in comparison) and it found all transactions. It's  also slightly faster than the little helper script I wrote for [#23549](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23549#issuecomment-1149904391).\r\n\r\nBonus feature for a followup: fetch any matching pruned blocks.",
