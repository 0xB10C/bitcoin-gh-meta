It could be a non issue for those that spend more time here than me.\r\n\r\nYep, non-issue. It comes from the segwit definitions (BIP141).\r\nThe transaction id is the hash of the transaction data serialized. The witness transaction id is the hash of the transaction data serialized + a marker, flag and witness data.\r\n\r\nif the witness data doesn't exist (or isn't there), then you are serializing only the regular transaction fields, thus why the tx id is equal to the witness id.\r\n\r\n> wallet_transaction_tests.CreateMultisigScriptAndImportDescriptor: Is there any reason why this test code creates a 3-of-5 multisig instead of a 2-of-3?\r\n\r\nNot really. For the test purposes, it could had been a 1-of-2 as well. I just liked more to present a scenario where the user looses data that is hard to re-do if keys are spread across different devices/places.\r\n\r\n> Was the removal of src/test/util/wallet.h and src/test/util.wallet.cpp part of routine cleanup? Because there is a src/wallet/test folder with way more in it and it doesn't make sense to have wallet unit tests in two places?\r\n\r\nBoth files were just containing utility functions to interact with the wallet. None of them are unit tests.\r\nThey were sharing the same purpose and the wallet code should be placed inside the wallet directory.\r\n\r\nPlus, as `wallet/test/util.h` and `wallet/test/util.cpp` were not part of the util library, we weren't able to use the functions on the bench and unit test modules (them are on different units). Which would had forced me to duplicate the `DuplicateMockDatabase` function that was inside of one of benchmarks to be able to use it in the new unit test case.",
