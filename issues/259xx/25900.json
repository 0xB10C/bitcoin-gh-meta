   "body" : "Previously, everything in the ci docker image ran as the root user. This would lead to certain directories (`ci/scratch`, `depends`) being owned by `root` after running the ci locally which would lead to annoying behavior such as subsequent guix builds failing due to `depends/` being owned by root.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a simple Dockerfile and an `entrypoint.sh` script which creates a non-root user in the container and chowns the mounted working directory. All the `docker exec` commands now run as the non-root user, except for the few that still need to run as root (mainly, installing packages).\r\n\r\nTo test this I checked out a fresh copy of the repo, applied my changes, ran the CI, and verified all the local file permissions were unchanged after the CI was finished running.",
