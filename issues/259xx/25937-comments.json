The pruning tests are in the `EXTENDED_SCRIPTS` and take a long time to run on my 2-core toaster, so it would be easier/more practical to test this if the new test could be reached sooner (if only it could be in, say, `wallet_transactiontime_rescan.py` or `test/functional/wallet_hd.py` instead). I'll retry running this a bit later tonight or overnight.",
