   "body" : "This is a followup to #19698.\r\n\r\n- There was a bug in the `ExcludeIndividualFlags` function which is fixed here.\r\n- Fixing this bug also showed that there is a test that's supposed to fail (already existing in tx_invalid.json) in tx_valid.json, so I removed it. Other than that, the tests should all pass. \r\n- This also made me notice that using `BOOST_CHECK_MESSAGE` for running the test itself was a lot more helpful in reporting errors than `BOOST_ERROR` so I used that instead.\r\n- Also implements a few suggestions I received offline: removing the `OP_1`s from the invalid tests (similar to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/19db590d044efe7d474a16720e5b56e7b55db54c), comments, and style.\r\n- While I was here, it also seemed appropriate to add the valid flag combinations check to tx_invalid (similar to a260c22cad0672dda11f42f649ebdc7cfa53b16a).",
