I'm seeing the feature_blockfilterindex_prune.py failure during the sync_all() call https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5429627528151040?command=ci#L3364 and a \"[ProcessGetBlockData] Ignore block request below NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED threshold from peer=0\" message in the logs.\r\n\r\nBut I don't understand what the log message means means or why replacing one generate/sync sequence with two would fix the problem. I also don't understand why this error seems to only happen on one platform, and I can't tell from the bug report whether this is happens reliably is some kind of race condition.",
