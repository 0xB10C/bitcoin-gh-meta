Bitcoin.org arguably inherited an implied license from Satoshi, but I have seen nothing concrete to clearly show Satoshi has licensed it for distribution elsewhere. Considering that the whitepaper is of little relevance to the released code (even in 2009) nor understanding it (modern terminology differs significantly), I don't see any reason to add it to this repo.",
