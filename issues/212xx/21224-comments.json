      "body" : "> This PR halts the processing of unrequested transactions in Bitcoin at TX message reception. An unrequested transaction is one defined by which a \"getdata\" message for its specific identifier (either txid or wtxid) has not been previously issued by the node.\r\n\r\nI don't see the point of this? An attacker with valid utxos can generate invalid txs that are costly to reject, and simply announce their txids and wait for a request. That's limited to 5000 txs in a batch (MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS), and I think each batch would have at least a 4s window (NONPREF_PEER_TX_DELAY + OVERLOADED_PEER_TX_DELAY). But that seems like it should be enough to keep the CPU busy? Even then, we'll make progress through every other node in between dealing with each tx from the attacker, so this shouldn't cause a denial of service as far as I can see? Presuming the tx's are consensus invalid, the attacker will get given a Misbehaving score for each invalid tx and eventually kicked.\r\n\r\n> It comes with a meaningful delay of running the framework (e.g +4min to run p2p_segwit.py)\r\n\r\nErr nack? :) Maybe better to add PF_RELAY to those tests than slow them down?",
