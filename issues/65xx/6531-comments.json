Considering that, in a healthy fee market environment, there will always be new transactions with a fee that causes new work to be required to match the filter, I'm not too concerned with churn causing poor filter matches. Remember such a metric is really only to make such systems work in the face of an attacker who is deliberately breaking them.\r\n\r\nRegarding the need for such a system: it isnt just about centralized systems. It makes just as much sense in a decentralized one as well, if that one has a need for mempool syncing to compress blocks (all current block compression protocols have this requirement). In a decentralized one, you would need to sync your mempool-discard-transaction-selection to use the same metric.",
