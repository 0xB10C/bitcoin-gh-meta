      "body" : "ECDH addresses have been previously discussed in the Dark Wallet \"stealth address\" scheme.  I'm not a super big fan of that scheme which has never been completely specified.\r\n\r\nIt results in addresses which are more than 2x larger than our current ones, largely so it can support a secure delegated scanning mode.  But, of course, the scanning delegation totally undermines the privacy of the system.  Adam Back and I spent some amount of time exploring fancier crypto to try to repair the scanning damage, but short of ought switching to pairing based signatures (which are slow to verify) we don't really have a way to fix the delegation.\r\n\r\nBut the ECDH code in libsecp256k1 can scan something like 40,000 transactions per second on a fast desktop. With that in mind, we could instead forget about delegation. \r\n\r\nI was contemplating a scheme for a future elements update called \"Donation addresses\" which would give you a stealth like ephemeral address which is as short as (or shorter) than a current Bitcoin address. But you couldn't securely delegate the scanning: someone who could scan for your payments could spend the coins.  This might be a worthwhile trade-off.\r\n \r\n\r\n",

In that sidechain CT is implemented as a major change to the transaction format, so it would be a hard fork to apply it directly.\r\n\r\nBut it's actually possible to implement CT as a soft fork, though ... more than a little kludge. Ignoring how ugly that might or might not be for a moment--\r\n\r\nWhat performance envelope do we think needs to be achieved for something like this to deploy it in Bitcoin?\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be helpful if I made a brief table that laid out the performance implications very clearly?\r\n\r\nThere are other schemes which could be considered, for example Zero Cash, but it's less clear how to soft fork deploy them (except e.g. via the extension block concept). Again, it's unclear how we can go about reasoning on the acceptable trade-offs in this space.",
