So how about instead we aim at making pluggable coin-selection?\r\n\r\nMaybe something as simple that pipes the target addresses and amounts, target fee (per kb), list of unspent, and a list of possible change addresses. The coin selector reads this in, writes out a set of inputs and outputs. Bitcoin could sanity check it, and then convert to a raw transaction and sign.\r\n\r\nHaving stand alone coin selection system would really encourage the development of good solutions, testing all free of the constraints of doing it from within bitcoin core itself :D",
