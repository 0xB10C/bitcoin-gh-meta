One of those contributions was importing a third party repository into the code base (the leveldb subtree) which I presume is what is distorting your results.\r\n\r\nOther projects also import large amounts of outside code, and you should take care to avoid misattributing in those cases. (In addition to leveldb, bitcoin also embedds other codebases such as libsecp256k1).\r\n\r\nPieter and Wladimir are substantial contributors. However:  From your text it sounds like you're counting who created files, for many projects including Bitcoin most files are created not as a result of authorship but as a result of moving code around, and so if you are measuring creation this may not be a useful metric. (In our case the most important authors also move code around, but in other projects the metric may be worse).\r\n\r\n(b) I don't know.  We may find out..\r\n\r\n(c) The project has successfully cycled out contributors during its lifetime already. So we do have an existence proof to some extent.\r\n",

There's a number of other independent groups working on forks of Bitcoin (altcoins) with varying degrees of expertise, significant ongoing documentation effort (Bitcoin Wiki, Stack Overflow, I believe it's now part of some degree courses). The technology is well understood, loss of any individual developer is more likely to be an issue of finding a highly skilled replacement, than of lack of knowledge or documentation.\r\n",
