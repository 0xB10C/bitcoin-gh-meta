What I'm trying to say is that I believe that bitcoin-tui should at least have a chance to be discussed on ideological level by the developers and not to be dismissed on a whim.",

Regarding the 'strong push' - I think there will never be a very strong push to include TUI from public at large the same way for example that most Firefox users don't push for Firefox Developers Tools to be included in their browser. But those niche groups who push for it are as important for the survival of the ecosystem as the big groups are; as those, most of the times, will be power users and developers themselves.",
