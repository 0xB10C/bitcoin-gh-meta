      "body" : "ACK concept.\r\n\r\nLong unconfirmed chains are inefficient - use RBF to replace txs with ones with more outputs - and post problems for future scalability improvements as they reduce parallelism opportunities in block processing.\r\n\r\nI'd implement it differently though as an additional depth value recorded for each tx in the mempool - nMaxDepth - where nMaxDepth = max(nMaxDepth of all parent txs) This is efficient to calculate, requiring only a single O(n) pass every time a block is found. There's lots of other use-cases for that kind of architecture too.",
