However without expiration of low fee transactions it's a pretty dangerous change, as the moment you fill up the mempool with junk that miners don't or can't mine your node stops relaying transactions - better to have nodes crash with OOM errors and get restarted than that.\r\n\r\nThe simplest thing to do is for the purpose of the pull-req, disable the limit by setting it to something ridiculously high by default to match the existing behavior. (or just add in the expiration code)",
