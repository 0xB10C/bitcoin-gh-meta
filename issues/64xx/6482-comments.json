      "body" : "Self-reviewing after having a chance to sleep on this:\r\n\r\nThis change would mean an unconfirmed transaction gives potential attackers some inputs that belong to me, but are signed so that they are committed to sending the coins to a particular set of outputs but NOT to-a-particular-set-of-outputs-but-only-when-bundled-with-a-particular-set-of-inputs.\r\n\r\nSo an attacker could:\r\n1) Replace the SIGHASH_ALL first input with one of their inputs. Costs the attacker however many coins are in the first input, not a very interesting attack (unless part of a larger attack that requires transaction malleability to pull off).\r\n\r\n2) If the first SIGHASH_ALL input's amount is less than the transaction fee, attacker could relay/broadcast without that first input. Not very interesting, worst case the alternate lower-fee transaction gets mined, user saves some coin.\r\n\r\n3) If the wallet has TWO or more unconfirmed, multi-input transactions with exactly the same outputs (paying exactly same amount to same address-- if change is generated, then  change address/amount exactly the same for both), then there is a worrisome attack:  attacker can combine all of the SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY inputs from the transactions into one big transaction that has an oversize fee, and mine that instead of the two transactions.\r\n\r\nWe can say \"don't re-use addresses\" ... but (3) is a good reason not to merge this as-is\r\n",
