This wasn't the case, when using bitcoind however, at least for me.\r\n\r\nIt turns out this seems to be another locale related issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/7e98a3c642222edc0813ced945d4b6e548cb8ca8 added [ParseDouble()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7e98a3c642222edc0813ced945d4b6e548cb8ca8/src/utilstrencodings.cpp#L461), which uses `strtod`.\r\n\r\n`strtod` is locale dependent, and with a locale, where the decial point isn't `.`, the resulting numbers are unexpected, and `ParseDouble()` fails, due to it's check, whether there are [trailing characters](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7e98a3c642222edc0813ced945d4b6e548cb8ca8/src/utilstrencodings.cpp#L471) left.\r\n\r\nWhen using QT, then it looks like `LC_NUMERIC` (and friends) are based on the user's locale, while bitcoind appears to use the `\"C\"` locale for all `LC_xxxx`.\r\n\r\nThe configuration option `\"-lang\"` seems to have no effect here.",
