The \"production rate\" of coinage is bounded, which means that one can set a minimum priority for transactions and a certain reserved size in each block and be ensured that, on average, all free transactions fit in this reserved block space forever.  I think that's a nice feature of the current fee policy, because it allows free transactions (psychologically appealing to users) for everyone who does not overuse their coins.  No spamming or DoS possible.\r\n\r\nBut of course, I agree that the change makes the code much simpler.",
