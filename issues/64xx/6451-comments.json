That would allow (for ex) a different blocksize or flagday on testnet so that we could test before the real thing.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think we could avoid a good bit of competing proposals if we pulled in a generic version of this that just parametrizes things as necessary to make the block size dynamic. It'd then just be a matter of debating what ```MaxBlockSize(uint64_t nBlockTimestamp)``` does internally.\r\n\r\nWe could even go as far as making it:\r\n```uint64_t MaxBlockSize(uint64_t nBlockTimestamp) { (void)nBlockTimestamp; return 1000000; }```\r\nfor now, which should be 100% uncontentious, and could be merged immediately.\r\n\r\nAny real blocksize changes would then be very straightforward in code.",

Furthermore with this pull-req every block mined on the original Bitcoin chain acts to 51% \"attack\" the Garzik chain; you *can't* mine original Bitcoin without participating in that 51% \"attack\".\r\n\r\nNote how the normal nVersion supermajority soft-fork mechanism is explicitly designed so that once 95% support is reached, that overwhelming majority \"attacks\" the 5% minority, ensuring that users still on the 5% minority only see the secure, 95% majority chain. Equally, the Bitcoin Core software is designed to allow that \"attack\" to happen, because with a 95% majority we'd prefer to go along. (the definition of a soft-fork!)",
