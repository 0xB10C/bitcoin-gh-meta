Without that change, nodes that received a headers message would otherwise wait to download blocks through the existing parallel fetch mechanism, which would generally make headers-announcement inferior to inv-announcements (because we have direct-fetch code in the inv-processing logic, which means we'd be quicker to request a new block).\r\n\r\nConsequently I think it makes sense for nodes to somehow opt-in to the new behavior.  0.10 and 0.11 nodes should continue to receive inv's even after this code is merged.\r\n\r\nOne thing that wasn't clear to me was whether it's really necessary to do the protocol version bump in order to deploy the new p2p message, given that the new message is backwards compatible -- nodes are free to ignore it.  However I'm not sure I have a good grasp of how the protocol versions should be thought about.\r\n",
