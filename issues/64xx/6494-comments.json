Without that change, nodes that received a headers message would otherwise wait to download blocks through the existing parallel fetch mechanism, which would generally make headers-announcement inferior to inv-announcements (because we have direct-fetch code in the inv-processing logic, which means we'd be quicker to request a new block).\r\n\r\nConsequently I think it makes sense for nodes to somehow opt-in to the new behavior.  0.10 and 0.11 nodes should continue to receive inv's even after this code is merged.\r\n\r\nOne thing that wasn't clear to me was whether it's really necessary to do the protocol version bump in order to deploy the new p2p message, given that the new message is backwards compatible -- nodes are free to ignore it.  However I'm not sure I have a good grasp of how the protocol versions should be thought about.\r\n",

      "body" : "@sipa @gmaxwell My preference for not sending a new messages comes from an event-driven implementor's POV. If a remote nodes are allowed to switch preferences mid-stream, it can greatly (and needlessly) complicate the local node's sending logic.\r\n\r\nThe easy way to avoid that is to disallow changing the preference _back_ once set (this seems to be the case in @sdaftuar's BIP). Taking that a step further, it also makes sense to only accept the message early in the connection process, say directly after version/verack, and before any inv. And if that's the case, it may as well just be considered as part of the handshake.\r\n\r\nEssentially, I would much prefer to avoid making life-of-the-connection properties stateful unless necessary. Extending the version message makes sense to me, but I understand @sipa's objection there. \r\n\r\n@gmaxwell's suggestion seems reasonable, assuming that the \"flags\" message had the requirement of being sent directly after version/verack. Absence of the message would actively (though perhaps unknowingly) communicate the desire for default flags (historic behavior). Again, this just seems like an extension of the version message to me, but if changes there are deemed problematic, this would be my preference.",
