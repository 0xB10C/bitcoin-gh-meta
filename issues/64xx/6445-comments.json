      "body" : "@NanoAkron Actually, no, I haven't. I don't really think the improvement will be that great, but hopefully it will be obvious to reviewers that performance can only be better, not worse (and the code is also cleaner IMO).\r\nOne thing is not easy to benchmark is changing the order of checks, for example, moving the check that impedes transactions from creating new money before checking the \"standard-ness\" of input scripts. Is that better? Well, that depends on how many of the transactions checked my acceptToMempool don't have standard scripts and how many are attempting to create new money, etc. So it basically depends on the test set and benchmarking that is not really that interesting. I can move those checks less if I'm asked to though.\r\n\r\nBut benchmarking the other changes (less repeated operations if the transaction is affected) would be great. @sipa do you have some advice (or maybe a code snippet to copy) on how to benchmark this?\r\n",
