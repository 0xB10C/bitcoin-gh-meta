This translates to often be x3 what you would expect it to be, and not consistent with the priority code. \r\n\r\nThis means:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbitcoin-cli settxfee `bitcoin-cli estimatefee 2`\r\n```\r\n\r\nis very unlike actually having the estimated fee target as 2. \r\n\r\nAnother side effect of this, is that the when using paytxfee it has an extremely unpredictable fee priority, as the true fee/kilobyte can easily vary by a factor of x3. When using paytxfee, I've noticed some transactions confirm in the next block (for fee reasons) while others have been stuck >5 blocks",
