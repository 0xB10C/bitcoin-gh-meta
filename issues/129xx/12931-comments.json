Unlike other kinds, winehq's wine doesn't age well.\r\n\r\nThis is their \"wine-stable\" so we don't (as we shouldn't) take upon us the job of testing experimental new wine, either.\r\n\r\nWould even more prefer to bump entire test environment to a more recent distribution (ref #12511) but I don't think Travis makes that possible (or easy), so this is a good intermediate step.\r\n\r\nutACK https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12931/commits/a833fe6df5c86c7cf3bae319a000b70048031e31\r\n\r\nAdditional motivation (from IRC):\r\n```\r\n<aj> wumpus: ^^ is a first pass at stopping 686-w32 travis builds from being constantly horrible\r\n```",
