      "body" : "This is @achow101's #11497 rebased and reworked. Notable differences:\r\n\r\n- I've moved the RPC method deprecation up into the `CRPCTable::execute()` function. That's perhaps a little bit messy (rpc/server.cpp ideally wouldn't have knowledge of individual Bitcoin RPCs), but it saves a lot of code duplication and will be removed in V0.18, so I decided it was acceptable to have it there.\r\n- Some methods (`sendmany` and `listtransactions`) have alternative help text depending on whether the `-deprecatedrpcs=accounts` switch is used. That means some duplicate text, but it makes the help text a lot clearer in all cases (since it's not filed with \"if using accounts this else that\").\r\n- I've avoided the argument repositioning that achow101 used, since that breaks the way rpc server fills in positional arguments from named arguments. That means that `sendmany` and `listtransactions` now have a dummy argument in the same way that `move` did. We can do another API change in a future version if that's offensive to people.\r\n\r\nThis PR also renames `rpc_listtransactions.py` to `wallet_listtransactions.py` (since it's a wallet test). This makes it clear that only wallet tests are affected by this change.",
