      "body" : "In my use-case (rust-bitcoinconsensus) we don't know anything more about the environment than non-configure Bitcoin. Re-implementing just enough of Bitcoin Core's configure to define the appropriate symbols seems like the wrong way to go (and would be entirely unmaintainable), actually running autogen/configure would also be a pain as we'd have to figure out what environment we're targeting and appropriately convert gcc flags to configure flags (as well as probably reimplement parts of the \"compile a C dependency\" rust module that is well-maintained by others). Not sure of another easy solution aside from this, but if we don't take it we should almost certainly add a #ifndef HAVE_CONFIG_H #error \"You need to run configure first\" in a bunch of places.",
