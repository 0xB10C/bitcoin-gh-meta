You could easily change that by updating `get_rpc_proxy()` to pass in the node_number, have that stored by `AuthServiceProxy`'s `__init__` method, and then have it passed into the `JSONRPCException`.\r\n\r\nIt's quite unusual that the stack trace doesn't indicate which node the RPC is being called on, and it's fairly easy to add pdb tracepoints or additional logging where that's not the case, so I don't know how useful this would be in general.",
