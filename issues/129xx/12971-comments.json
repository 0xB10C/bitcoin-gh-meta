It is though as soon as you are trying to cross compile to windows (which requires Mingw5.3). \r\nI originally did not want to open the pr for this reason, since it would mean that the current travis tests would be broken because of the windows build requirement. I heard though that @theuni is working on getting the entire toolchain on depends, so I decided to publish the patch nevertheless to prevent duplicate work and enable other developers to already compile bitcoin static with a modern Qt version. \r\n\r\nThe macos build needs some further investigation. It fails upon creating qmake and the current qmake patch does not seem to work. Upon some investigation, I saw that multiple people had to do some manual property setting on xcode to make the build work. I am not sure if this is related though. ",
