      "body" : "Thank you @dooglus for bringing attention to this in #11317 and opening #11320. \r\n\r\nThis is #11320 with the following changes:\r\n * rebased on master\r\n * added the wallet name in three additional logging messages for `rpcdump.cpp`'s `importwallet` function\r\n\r\nIn #11320 @promag and @luke-jr suggested approaches to reducing the repetition of `\"[%s]\" GetName()` boilerplate. @jimpo, in the context of #12954, what are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nThis is outside of the scope of this PR and may be controversial, but I do think we would benefit from automated testing of log messages. This could either be done by checking the `debug.log` of nodes in existing tests, or as a separate test script.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n1. There are logging calls in two `WalletBatch` methods where it's not immediately apparent to me how to get the wallet's name: `WalletBatch::FindWalletTx` and `WalletBatch::RecoverKeysOnlyFilter`. Is there something I'm not seeing? If the only solution is refactoring then I'll leave them alone in this PR.\r\n\r\n2. `CWallet`'s `m_name` defaults to an empty string, so we end up with lots of empty square brackets in the log messages. Should we have a default wallet name?",

      "body" : "I luke-jr's suggestion of `CWallet::LogPrintf`. The main benefit is not even reducing boilerplate, it's to reduce the amount of refactoring required if someone decides that there is a better way of presenting the wallet info on the log line. Also, I think it'll be more obvious that way when people add new log statements in wallet files as compared to noticing the extra log argument and having to realize that it's a standard.\r\n\r\nWith regards to #12954, I don't see any issues. Won't even be a git conflict, I don't think.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of a case where [structured logging](https://stackify.com/what-is-structured-logging-and-why-developers-need-it/) might be useful (being able to tag log statments with key-value pairs in a not-ad-hoc way). I know the Bitcoin ABC team is thinking about this.",
