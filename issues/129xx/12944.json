This is fixed by a restart of the wallet.\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble re-creating this inside the functional tests(it's passing when it shouldn't without my fix), though I think the logic here is clearly better.\r\n\r\nIf people are ok with a fix without a test, I can remove the test, or perhaps gather some suggestions on how to hit this corner case.",
