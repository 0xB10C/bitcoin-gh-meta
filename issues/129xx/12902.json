This can cause a race condition when restarting the node, where\r\nthe test framework might try to connect using credentials from the\r\nold cookie file, just as the node will generate new credentials and\r\noverwrite the old file.\r\n\r\nIf this happens, the test framework will receive an 'Unauthorized'\r\nresponse from the server. Handle this the same way we deal with missing\r\ncredentials (sleep and try again).",
