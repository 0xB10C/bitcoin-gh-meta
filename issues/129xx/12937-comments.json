It could be moved to `script/script.cpp` if we also moved `Solver` to that file, from `script/standard.cpp`\r\n\r\n`CScript::IsWitnessProgram` is necessarily publicly visible.\r\n\r\nIn both of the latter cases, we could overload the method in a deprecated way to enable ongoing support for any external callers. I'll take y'alls call as to whether that's necessary.",
