No other code changes besides adding/removing `U` to/from values.\r\n\r\n~~I am considering a different fix, where a new `BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL` macro is created that ignores signedness, since this had an unexpected amount of line changes (although extremely trivial, that may appear contentious or disruptive to other PR's...).~~ (Too hacky, and diff doesn't shrink in the end.)",
