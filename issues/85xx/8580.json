   "body" : "This is an alternative to #8451.\r\n\r\nInstead of making CTransaction mutable-but-with-cached-hash, it makes it actually fully immutable and never modifies any of its elements (apart from wit) after construction.\r\n\r\nTo do so, we heavily rely on C++11. CTransaction gets a (CMutableTransaction&&) constructor that efficiently converts a CMutableTransaction into a CTransaction without copying. In addition, the stream classes get a Construct() method that deserialize-and-construct an element on the fly. CTransaction implements such a constructor by deserializing into a CMutableTransaction and then converting it using delegation to a CTransaction.\r\n\r\nThe only downsize is one very ugly performance hack. If CTransaction is immutable, no transaction inside a vector can be modified in-place. Unfortunately, this is needed in some of the mining code to update the coinbase. The only solutions I see are either fully copying the entire block (with a deep copy!), or using placement new to destroy and reconstruct the coinbase in-place. This PR implements the latter - which I believe to be well-defined but very ugly. Suggestions or rants welcome.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Another downside is the duplication of some of the serialization logic in CMerkleTx and CWalletTx. If this approach is deemed acceptable, we could probably improve the serialization framework to automatically generate deserializing constructors for functions from the single SerializationOp implementation. I don't want that kind of refactoring here yet, as it's only used in one place, and this PR touches already enough code.",
