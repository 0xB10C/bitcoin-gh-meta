I looked into how other projects handle the manpages.\r\nAnd it seems most of the stuff gets automatically handled by automake, just need to define a few things.\r\n\r\nSo I got inspired by how gnome does it: https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/tree/Makefile.am\r\nand played a bit around in trial&error mode. And came up with this: https://github.com/nomnombtc/bitcoin/commits/man_automake\r\n\r\nBut I wasn't sure about the license of the debian manpages, only one is MIT the others are GPL.\r\nThen I found this program called `help2man`, which creates manpages from running a binary with -help option and so I just created a few manpages on my own.\r\n\r\nA positive side effect of all of this is that those manpages now also end up in the tarball that gets created by `make dist`  - which was my goal with this PR we are commenting in here ...\r\n\r\nIf you think this is the correct way of doing it and you can clarify if the debian manpages can be included because of the GPL license, we could use this for 7626.",

I don't have an answer there. I do not know what the licensing rules are for documentation, but I'd feel better to have them under the same license as Bitcoin Core itself.\r\n\r\nWe could ask the authors if they agree with re-licensing.\r\n\r\nGood idea to auto-generate the man pages! that will prevent them from being eternally out of date. The installation step looks ok to me.\r\n\r\n- As `gen_manpages.sh` is a tool to be manually executed by developers in a suitable environment, please put it in `contrib/devtools`, the scripts to update translations and such are there too.\r\n",
