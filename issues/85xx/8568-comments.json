      "body" : "Indeed this would make sense. I looked into how other projects handle the manpages.\r\nAnd it seems most of the stuff gets automatically handled by automake, just need to define a few things.\r\n\r\nSo I got inspired by how gnome does it: https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/tree/Makefile.am\r\nand played a bit around in trial&error mode. And came up with this: https://github.com/nomnombtc/bitcoin/commits/man_automake\r\n\r\nBut I wasn't sure about the license of the debian manpages, only one is MIT the others are GPL.\r\nThen I found this program called `help2man`, which creates manpages from running a binary with -help option and so I just created a few manpages on my own.\r\n\r\nA positive side effect of all of this is that those manpages now also end up in the tarball that gets created by `make dist`  - which was my goal with this PR we are commenting in here ...\r\n\r\nIf you think this is the correct way of doing it and you can clarify if the debian manpages can be included because of the GPL license, we could use this for 7626.",
