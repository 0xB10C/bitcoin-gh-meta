   "body" : "This undoes some of #7749. It's unnecessary most of the time to disconnect from a node simply because the advertised services (which could be weeks old) said it used to offer certain services yet now does now. The services actually needed from a node are anyway determined at connect time, and never (well, not so far) at a time BEFORE trying to connect to a node. The advertised services should never be relied upon anyway, as they could always change between being advertised and the node eventually being tried.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this disconnect should be removed and only in the situation where a node needs services and the node is found to not provide them, disconnect. E.g. for an Initial Blockchain Download, it will need the NODE_NETWORK services, so in this case it would be reasonable to disconnect from a node unable to provide historical blocks. However, just because a node once advertised historical blocks, and upon connection it is found it does not, then disconnecting simply because our node feels deceived is counterproductive if our node doesn't even need historical blocks!",
