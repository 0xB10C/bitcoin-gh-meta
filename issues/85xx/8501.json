   "body" : "This PR adds a statistics collector class which aims to collect various types of statistics up to the configurable maximum memory target. At the moment, only mempool statistics will be collected.\n\nInstead of constant polling, I think there should be a core class that manages stats collecting that aims for a very small impact on performance.\n### Motivation\n\nAdding more statistics and visualization to the GUI would leverage its usage. To do so, we need stats that are collected even when the visualization is not visible (example: the GUI network graph will only draw data when it's visible which is kinda unusable)\n### How it works\n\nThis PR adds a simple stats manager that does the sample collecting without an additional thread.\nAvoiding a thread should reduce the locked states and indirectly improves performance.\n\nInstead, it will hook in at the point where the observed data-set will be mutated (for mempool at the point where transactions are added or removed). This will result in not explicit locking for stats collecting. To not overcorrect, the `addSample` routine will ensure a min time delta.\n\nThis will result in non-fixed-timespan samples which are easy to handle during visualization (either draw non-linear or interpolate).\n\nTwo new startup arguments are added:\n- `-statsenable` **default disabled**\n- `-statsmaxmemorytarget` **10MB default** maximal memory target to use for statistics.\n### What's includes\n\nThis PR does not include UI changes (currently working on those) but it includes a simple RPC dump (`cs_main` lock free).\nAdding the RPC stats API does allow third party apps to visualize data without being responsible for endless polling of the data (which could result in performance issue if you poll to aggressive or with multiple applications).\n",
