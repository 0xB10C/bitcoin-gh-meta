This changes the meaning for state.CorruptionPossible() for transactions from \"witness possibly invalidated\" to \"witness stripped\". This is faster (no need for 3 script checks) and simpler for the DoS logic.\r\n\r\nThis also removes the special logic to not assign DoS for witness failures for non-witness peers. That logic already exists in more generic form, through the non-mandatory script verify flags.\r\n\r\nSee also #8279.",
