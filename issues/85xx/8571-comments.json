The code you\nare removing also does not disconnect whenever the services just differ -\nthey must differ in one of the bits set in nServicesExpected.\n\nNODE_NETWORK right now encompasses both the ability to serve historical\nblocks and the ability to relay new blocks. We should never make an\noutbound connection to nodes that do not have NODE_NETWORK, so if we notice\nthat an IP we are connecting to actually does not offer it, we should\ndisconnect and try another peer that can give us what we want.\n\nIn the future, there may indeed be a separation i  flags between the\nability to relay and the ability to serve old blocks, and we may choose to\nnot demand the old blocks capability in nExpectedServices anymore after\nIBD, but that is still something that can be determined before connecting.\n",
