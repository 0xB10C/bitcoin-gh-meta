   "body" : "Signing transactions with ANYONECANPAY has a number of advantages:\r\n\r\n1) Anyone can bump fees by adding a (small-valued) input: This can get struck\r\ntransactions unstuck more effectively than CPFP, which may not work if the\r\nparent transaction hasn't gotten to a miner's mempool due to low fees.\r\n\r\n2) Privacy/Fungibility: If inputs aren't signing each other, they're not making\r\nany explicit statement about the relationship of one input to another. In\r\nparticular, any input that's less than the transaction fee is possibly from\r\nanother wallet, confusing taint analysis with plausible deniability.\r\n\r\n3) Discouraging Re-Orgs: By allowing anyone to add inputs to any transaction,\r\nwe make malicious re-orgs targetting particular coins more disruptive, as the\r\nset of non-targetted transactions unrelated to the target coins can grow\r\nfaster, increasing the colateral damage of a malicious re-org attack.\r\n\r\nThe downside of ANYONECANPAY is mutability, but if we're not spending zeroconf\r\nchange that's irrelevant; enabling ANYONECANPAY if zeroconf change is disabled\r\nis an easy and low-risk first step towards using ANYONECANPAY more widely.\r\n\r\nI've also opened an issue for joinmarket to implement this: https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket/issues/599",
