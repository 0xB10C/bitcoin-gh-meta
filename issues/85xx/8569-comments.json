      "body" : "As defined in the [bitcoin.org developer documentation](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#version) a ```verack``` should not be sent (at all) before a mutual exchange of ```version``` messages.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the linked developer documentation superceeds actual reference client behavior, but it only seems good and proper that all clients must observe this handshake behavior.\r\n\r\nRather than move functionality to where it will activate (because of protocol breach), or queue a ```verack``` message until its *probably* associated ```version``` message arrives, it seems best that client code enforces the correct order? I assume (but have not established for a fact) that this is already the case for Core. \r\n\r\n> Ok, I realize all these examples are the same node, ...\r\n\r\nYour logs show four peers are misbehaving: peers 2, 8, 11 and 4. Do you mean that you have only observed these renegade ```verack``` messages on the node whose logs you quote above?",
