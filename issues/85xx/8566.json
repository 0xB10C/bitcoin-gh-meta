All of the commands are pulled from various documentation on gitian building.\r\n\r\nThe script allows you to specify unsigned or signed builds, which os to build for, the signer, the version (or commit/branch), and build arguments (threads and memory).\r\n\r\nRight now setup is designed for debian based systems.\r\n\r\nIt runs a few commands that require sudo. For best automation, add apt-get, lxc-start, lxc-execute, and ifconfig to your sudoers file.",
