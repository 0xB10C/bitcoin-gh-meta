Yet most understand about what percentage of their balance they want to send, and they can then check the percentage to be certain that it's not excessive or too little.\n\nIf someone is to send two or more transactions at once, to adjust the percentages accordingly. \n\nOR:\n\nShow a cautionary message by the transaction form if the amount exceeds a configurable percentage of balance.\n",
