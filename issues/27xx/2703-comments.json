That just creates higher transaction fees for your users, prevents you from implementing proper security (an offline wallet), and propagates harmful myths about Bitcoin (such as that transactions have \"from\" or \"return\" addresses).\r\n\r\nWhat real problem are you trying to solve here, that you think needs each user to have isolated coins?",

      "body" : "@luke-jr My original idea was just to use \"account\" as a ledger.\r\nThat is : using the balance of each account in order to implement a simple exchange system.\r\nMy idea was : if two users are on the same wallet : do the transaction off-the-network (move) instead of a regular sendfrom(). For this I needed to check that the sender has enough funds confirmed by 6 blocks (hence the move [minconf]).\r\nBut I guess that writing my own ledger/account system is a better idea.\r\n",
