Incoming zero fee transactions like 99XX bytes with sufficient priority would be accepted by nodes with nBlockPrioritySize 27000 but rejected by otherwise identical code with nBlockPrioritySize of 10000 with \"not enough fees\".  The mempool in both nodes had a few small 225 byte high priority transactions.  Wouldn't you expect the node with  nBlockPrioritySize of 10000 to accept a 99XX byte transaction and keep it in the memory pool until there is room in a later block?",
