This is a case of database error that goes undetected likely, so incorrect data is read back at some point, which mismatches the chain spends.\r\n\r\nI'd very much like to know whether it is consistently the same block that triggers it (and if so, which). Can you try to reproduce the problem again, and report the exact InvalidChainFound errors reported (in particular \"InvalidChainFound:  current best=%s  height=%d  log2_work=%.8g  date=%s\" lines)?\r\n\r\nThat would be very helpful.",

It was only after I restarted it (via `bitcoind stop` and `bitcoind -daemon`), and then for a connection to register, that the \"Warning: Displayed transactions [...]\" error started showing up.  I seem to remember that this is what was happening before, as well.  But the transaction verification process was clearly stuck at progress=0.280715 regardless.  For the second run, `bitcoind getinfo` was reporting the error when I went back to check it.\r\n\r\nI still have all the logs from both failed runs.  Is there any more info I can provide, or further tests I can run?\r\n",

I deleted (renamed, actually) `~/.bitcoin`, re-ran `bitcoind -daemon` using the pre-built binary in the tarball (and again, after setting the `rpcuser`/`rcppassword`), left it running for several hours and then checked `bitcoind getinfo` and the logs for errors.\r\n\r\nThe machine this is running on is well used and has not shown any memory- or cpu-like errors.  All the same, I ran memtest86+ for over an hour without error, just to be sure.  If it's something odd about my system that's causing this, it may be that I am using Debian sid/unstable (with a few packages from experimental).  So I wouldn't rule out the kernel or the few shared libraries that the pre-built binary uses from the system.  Should I try the pre-built binary on a live-CD of, say, Ubuntu 13.04 to see if it exhibits the same problems?",

So, it looks like I'm getting a fairly reliable 100% failure rate when *not* using `par=1` and 100% success rate when using it.\r\n\r\nI'll try to run the above test (live CD of another distro, running binary from your tarball, no `par=1`) tomorrow, while I'm at work, and report back in the evening. Since Ubuntu is based on Debian, though, would it be wiser to try something more different, like Fedora? Or would you rather I use Ubuntu?",

This is not technically database corruption, but it does end in an incorrect state. This seems like a hardware problem, but there could be a bug too of course - though I would expect it to be reported much more often in that case.\r\n\r\n@epros 's is actual corruption, with LevelDB detecting a corruption, and after continuing noticing a missing transaction output in the chainstate. That is certainly outside of bitcoind's control (either hardware or a LevelDB problem).",

Interestingly, a bitcoin 0.8.1 could build the block chain just fine.  And then that block chain was \"acceptable to the newer versions mentioned.  The error seen was an infinite loop (recursion) in 0.8.6 starting in SetBestChain()\r\nbut getting trapped forever in InvalidBlockFound calling InvalidChainFound() apparently forever.  I didn't wait to see if it was actually doing some long crawl back up a tree?  In bitcoin 0.9.1 there  was a similar apparent infinite loop, though the code is different in this area, so I can't say what exactly it was repeating.  Needles to say, I don't think it is hardware related, since the different versions behave differently with apparently the same data coming in.  Just a straw in the wind.\r\n\r\nRon",
