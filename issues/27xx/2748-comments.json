In the meantime, though, @warren has helped me to get the gitian descriptors up and running for win32, and linux should be easy after that.\r\n\r\nI've gotten the same vibe from the others, so I'll finish up with the impression that back-compat is not needed. Also, @laanwj said he is ok with figuring out some solution for himself for the .pro file, so I'll not concern myself with that either.",
