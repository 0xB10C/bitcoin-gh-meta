That would be nice to have, but unfortunately it wouldn't be portable because prefixes will vary. I think I'd rather leave that out.\r\n\r\nFor the shared libs, it's important to remember that the SONAME is libbitcoinconsensus.so.0, which affects linkage. So either we need to maintain the symlinks (1 level, at least), or handle versioning ourselves. Personally, I'd prefer the former.",
