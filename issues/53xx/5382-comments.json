My one reservation with removing is that I think we currently have no RPC method to find out about orphaned blocks that we know... otherwise this output is completely redundant with what you can get more easily via rpc.\r\n\r\nActually, scracht that... with getchaintips we can even get the orphans. So ACK removal, since it's redundant to data already better available in RPC.  If you want to be snazzy you could feel free to just add a commit removing it on top of this commit fixing it; so a fixed version is in the history if someone wants it. :)",
