Bitcoind can also create a tor hidden service automatically (with `-listenonion`) but those two are not exclusive. Specifying both will not cause an error, it will just result in two hidden services.\r\n\r\n> Seperately (Yes, no not support questions..) is it also necessary to -setexternalip= for Bitcoin Core to your onion service at command line / in bitcoin.confas the linked document suggests, even when using 'ephemeral' hidden service working with AddLocal message?\r\n\r\nThe automatic hidden service will automatically be regarded as local address and thus gossiped. Unless you override the external IP with `-externalip`, in which case I think you do need to specify it because that overrides the automatic setting.",
