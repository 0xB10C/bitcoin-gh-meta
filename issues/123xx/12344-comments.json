      "body" : "I agree that setting `onlynet=onion` should tell your node to only attempt outbound connections to onion peers but, v0.15.1 still makes some IPv4 connections (I presume they are made using the proxy settings - I have no easy way to check at hand - my network log box is away in storage!). Onion peers always report as `us=[::]:0` in the log but these were IPv4 addresses as noted. As you can see from the `bitcoin.conf` file I have posted I am using `bind=127.0.0.1` already and do not expect any incoming connects on IPv4 either. All of the connections from the log snippet I posted are outbound, I have added peer 6 to that now.",
