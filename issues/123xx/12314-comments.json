I don't see a reason why regtest should produce addresses that can be confused with testnet.\r\n\r\nReasons:\r\n\r\n* It introduces additional complexity. And therefore  good reasons to actually introduce such distinction should be given, and not good reasons not to introduce it. What practical problems does having this distinction solve?\r\n* For good or bad, the existing address formats were the same on testnet vs regtest. There is a lot of existing code out there that expect no difference between tesnets and regtests addresses. Such distinction breaks some long established assumptions.\r\n* It creates confusion. Many places are not even mentioning this prefix when listing details of bech32. Example: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes . From what I've discovered in the discussion above, not even [BIP-173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) mentions it. :confused: \r\n*  (I think,) the reason to have distinction between mainnet and testnet is to protect end users from making mistakes by confusing them, which could lead to losing real mainnet bitcoin. Such confusion between regtest and testnet is benign. Protecting users from loosing testnet coins on regtest, or tegtest coins on testnet is pointless.\r\n* One way to test complex systems integrating Bitcoin, is to swap a normal node with a regtest node, and manually drive it to exercise certain scenarios (say: reorgs) and drive the block creation much faster than a real testnet/mainnet. That was all great before, but now with this change the \"compex system\" under test has to be altered (possibly in many places) just to make it support another \"network\". A network that is exactly like testnet network, but with one little difference that does not seem to have much reason to exist in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere is still not too late to get rid of `bcrt`. It's not a consensus change (since regtests are in consensus with themselves anyway), and I doubt anyone would miss it.",
