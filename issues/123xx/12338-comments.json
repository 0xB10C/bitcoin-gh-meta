      "body" : "@licklake  it appears the version of libevent installed is incompatible. \r\n\r\nYou can work around it by building the deps as well from src, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd depends\r\nmake\r\ncd ..\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure --prefix=$PWD/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nif you don't need QT/GUI and say UPNP you can change the first `make` (the one in depends) to \r\n`make NO_QT=1 NO_UPNP=1`\r\n\r\n\r\nhope this helps!",
