   "body" : "I performed a 'Send Bitcoin' transaction from my really old Bitcoin QT Core client (V0.7 2-beta) a few days ago as a Test. The client is YEARS out of date regarding the Blockchain.\r\n\r\nI can see the Transaction Status on the client about an hour after sending it was given as -->\r\n\r\n\"Status: 0/unconfirmed, broadcast through 28 nodes\".\r\n\r\nI sent the nominal BTC transaction to an address beginning with \"1B..\" a legacy BTC address. There was a Transaction fee added natively by the Client (0.0005 BTC).\r\n\r\nIÃ¢ÂÂve got a BTC Transaction ID for the Send BTC - but it is not showing up on blockchain.info, after over a week now.. ?\r\n\r\nAnyone know what might be the problem ?\r\n\r\nps - If this is a hopeless scenario - is there anywhere I could reverse that transaction ?\r\n\r\nUnderstand a Core Client Upgrade would be the way to go - but I was just checking if I could so a Send (as a Tester), to save me all the time to get my setup up to date, download 145gig etc..\r\n\r\nThanks!",
