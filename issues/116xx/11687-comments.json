You had to configure each client with the absolute path of the wallet. These clients can be others than bitcoin-cli. Now the server operator decides it has to move the wallet to a new location. \r\n\r\nI don't see how this is much different than the server renaming the wallet. If a server admin wants to create a stable name for a wallet, it's perfectly possible to do that by creating a symlink or just manipulating the -datadir or -walletdir (#11687) settings to be able store the wallets in different locations without changing the name. I believe this PR actually gives server admins more flexibility in this regard rather than less, because previously wallet symlinks were disallowed.\r\n\r\nBut to take the example at face value, you have a server admin who accidentally exposed a non-stable wallet name, instead of a stable wallet name over the rpc interface to clients on the internet outside of his control. What solutions would you like to see for this problem? Would it be good enough to use `fs::path(walletFile).filename()` instead of `walletFile` as the wallet name passed to `CreateWalletFromFile` like I suggested earlier? Do you want wallet names to be configurable on the command line? Do you want them to be configurable by RPC? Do you want wallet names to be stored inside wallet databases like Jonas suggested?",

      "body" : "> The PR doesn't do this (and never did). The first commit of the PR is a refactoring specifically to add support for opening multiple BDB environments.\r\n\r\nSorry! I didn't read the code but was apparently confused by all the screaming about dangerousness. If you added support for multiple database environments you get my concept ACK.\r\n\r\n> Suggest renaming wallet.dat in the directory to wallet.bdb to convey the fact that you can't just copy the file to make a proper backup.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should be changing the default naming of wallet databases. People have been backing up separate wallet.dats forever, and generally it works because bitcoin core leaves the wallet in consolidated state. So I'd prefer documenting that behavior instead.\r\n\r\nEven a backup with the last update stripped is better than no backup. From that it's usually possible to recover due to the mempool or HD seed. But if they can't find 'wallet.dat', they might decide not to to a backup at all.\r\n\r\nTurning the abstraction in the user's mind of wallets into directories is going to be an upstream fight as well. I'm not against it, but I think it will result in a lot of confusion.",
