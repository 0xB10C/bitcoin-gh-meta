You can run Bitcoin Qt client as admin or simply try to choose another folder for data.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want `%AppData%`, it's understandable, but believe me, %ProgramFiles% isn't a good choice and you'll probably forget to back it up before you reinstall Windows, hence lose your wallet and your coins. If you have enough room in your `%UserProfile%` folder, you can create a folder there for Bitcoin wallet (`%UserProfile%` is usually in `C:\\Users\\YourNameHere\\`).",
