   "body" : "This change consists of two commits. The first commit removes the restriction that two wallets can only be opened at the same time if they are contained in the same directory. The second commit removes the restriction that `-wallet` filenames can only refer to files in the `-datadir` directory.\r\n\r\nBoth commits are pretty straightforward. The first commit adds around 10 lines of new code and then updates a bunch of function signatures (generally updating them to take plain fs::path parameters, instead of combinations of strings, fs::paths, and objects like CDBEnv and CWalletDBWrapper). The second commit removes two `-wallet` filename checks and adds some test cases to the multiwallet unit test.\r\n",
