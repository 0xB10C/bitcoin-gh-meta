I would at least like to see a percent indicator based on what percentage of blocks have been processed.  This wouldn't have to update constantly, updating once every 10 minutes or so would help a lot.  I realize that the status of this source code has almost reached religious significance for those of us who are bitcoin maximalists, but I think this would be a great feature to add, if anyone wants to do it.
