For me the issue ended up disappearing and I assumed the bitcoin automake scripts had been adjusted but I guess not. \r\n\r\nIt might be path related. I always do my builds from /usr/src/bitcoin rather than one of the Windows mounted drives, /mnt/*. I'll have another crack at tracking it down. In the meantime one possible fix may that's worked for some people is:\r\n\r\n> make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32 V=1 AUTOMAKE=:\r\n\r\n",
