The default value can already be changed with `-walletrbf`. This also happens with, for instance, `-keypool` and `keypoolrefill` RPC. Agree in adding release note but more regarding `-walletrbf` and the impact in coin control, these RPC and the wallet transactions.\r\n\r\nI still think the UI change is independent of this, and subject to other discussion (aim for easier reviews).",

      "body" : "@ryanofsky that previous PR turned on RBF by default for both the wallet and RPC.\r\n\r\nA number of objections were raised. I'll address the ones that I think are relevant:\r\n\r\n@luke-jr (and @instagibbs):\r\n> Probably shouldn't be merged until something can actually use it (preferably from the GUI).\r\n\r\nThat's the case now.\r\n\r\n@RHavar:\r\n> I was supportive of bip125 because it was marketed, sold and even titled: \"Opt-in\". But this simple change in defaults really makes it \"Opt-out\" and will end up causing huge impacts to people who are currently relying on 0-conf transactions, as suddenly everyone is going to be accidentally sending \"opt-in\" RBF.\r\n\r\nI suppose that's unchanged. I think opt-in refers to the fact that it's a soft fork? I think the best way to counter bad press is to make the feature work great and have users and (most) merchants love it.\r\n\r\nThere were some issues with usability at the time, which I'm guessing have been addressed since?\r\n\r\nThere was also discussion about RBF vs. CPFP. Given that the RBF check box made it into the UI, I don't think that's relevant (at least not for the scope of this issue). Although perhaps we could warn users that using RBF breaks the ability of CPFP for the recipient (does it?). I could imagine a merchant using CPFP for large purchases as a customer service gesture.\r\n\r\n@TheBlueMatt:\r\n> Obviously I'd agree we shouldn't do this unless bumpfee goes in.\r\n\r\nThat's there now. \r\n\r\n@gmaxwell:\r\n> As far as your zero-conf comments, that is why my comment here and on the bumpfee PR talk about being able to after-the-fact turn it off.\r\n\r\nIs this currently possible? If not, should we wait for that?\r\n\r\n@RHavar:\r\n> If this is going to be the default, it seems that bumpfee first at least be able to handle all transactions (e.g. ones without change)?\r\n\r\nI don't understand RBF really well, but if transactions without change can't use RBF, it would be good UX to grey-out and the checkbox for those transactions (and set it to disabled). We don't want the wallet to throw errors with default settings. Does it mean you can't send the transaction at all, or just not bump it? Both are problematic though.\r\n\r\n> Likewise it would also make sense to have \"reverttransaction\" as a prerequisite too. It would help people fully realize how revertible bip125 transactions are\r\n\r\nI'd like that feature too, but I think it can be added later.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the bump fee feature is pretty well hidden in the UI, but that's another issue...\r\n\r\nSome original objections might still hold since @laanwj closed it, but others have been addressed since early this year. So it seems useful to discuss this again",

But a setting \"enable bip125 (if we have change)\" is the logical behavior, but annoying to explain.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAll that said, I'm still very against this change. The reiterate my objections:\r\n\r\nBip125 was explicitly sold as \"opt-in\" to turn it to \"opt-out\" is rather distasteful, and has a lot of externalities. \r\n\r\nI would drop this objection if there was a significant (>5%) of hash power that was maliciously mining 0-conf double spends. But there simply isn't.\r\n\r\nMy latest project has in the last weeks processed 279 transactions worth 339 BTC with 0-confirmations transaction (after passing a few safety checks) without a single successful double-spend. I'm aware it's probably going to break horribly in the future, but it would be appreciate if yall didn't go out of your way to break shit that works and gives users a good experience.\r\n\r\nAnd my other objection is, that core users can't even take full advantage of bip125. Unless there's an exposed simple \"bump fee\" (that works reliably) and \"revert transaction\". It seems totally premature to expose users (and the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem) to all the disadvantage of bip125, without at the very least allowing users fully take advantage of it.",
