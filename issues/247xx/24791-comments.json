It's a limited palette so having any unusable colors is a waste. The default color scheme tends to be most suitable for white backgrounds (usually) but every terminal will allow you to change them.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not against changing the colors but it seems like a literal shed-painting issue, there's always going to be someone with a background shade / palette combination that will have trouble seeing some color.",
