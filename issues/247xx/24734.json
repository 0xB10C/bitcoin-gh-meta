   "body" : "PRs #22736, #22904 and #23223 changed lock contention logging from a `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive to a runtime `lock` log category and improved the logging output. See the discussion around https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691277896 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-902851054 with respect to performance/cost aspects; there are [concerns](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2022-03-31.html#l-620) that `Base::try_lock()` may be costly or [dangerous](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22904#issuecomment-930484001) compared to `Base::lock()` in this very frequently called code. \r\n\r\nOne alternative to keep the run-time lock logging would be to gate the `try_lock` call behind the logging conditional, for example as proposed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ccd73de1dd969097d34634c2be2fc32b03fbd09e and ACKed [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#issuecomment-901980815). This would add the cost of `if (LogAcceptCategory(BCLog::LOCK))` to the hotspot, instead of replacing `lock` with `try_lock`.\r\n\r\nFor now, out of prudence and for backport in v23, this pull reverts the lock contention logging to a  `DEBUG_LOCKCONTENTION` compile-time preprocessor directive while retaining the logging improvements as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22736#discussion_r691280693 and the linked IRC discussion.",
