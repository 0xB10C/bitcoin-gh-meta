   "body" : "Now that the commit (7c08d81e119570792648fe95bbacddbb1d5f9ae2) which changes taproot to be enforced for all blocks is sufficiently buried by other commits, and thus less likely to be reverted,  it seems a good time to remove no longer needed non-consensus code.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the taproot deployment status will be reported on RPC. However, the result is neither wrong nor correct. While it can tell the block height at which taproot activated, it doesn't reflect that the rules are enforced since genesis. Since it is possible to determine the taproot activation height by running a previous release or simply looking it up in the BIP, there is no need to report it in a field.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the `feature_taproot` functional test is cleaned up to no longer run against a previous release. Since previous releases are static and impossible to change, it is sufficient to run the test once against the release. Now that this is done, the check can be removed without decreasing test coverage.",
