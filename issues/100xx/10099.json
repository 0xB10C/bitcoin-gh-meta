The worst offender, `test_CheckQueue_Correct_Random` ran 3.4X faster. \r\n\r\n1. Removes `GetRand()` and replaces it with a single deterministic FastRandomContext instance.\r\n\r\n1. Exposes more parallelism with relaxed atomics, increasing chance of catching a bug. This does not change performance on my machine.\r\n\r\n1. Makes one test case more restrictive (xor instead of or, see #9938).\r\n\r\n",
