      "body" : "Another (more general) approach, also used in many other daemons, would be to support include statements in configuration files, this would allow including any options from other places besides the main configuration file not just the password.\r\n\r\nBTW `rpcpassword` is deprecated. If you use the newer rpcauth mechanism (introduced in #7044, first in 0.12.0) you can use hashed passwords in the configuration file. This is not a workaround for storing secrets in world-readable locations but makes it non-trivial to recover the cleartext password given access to the configuration file.",
