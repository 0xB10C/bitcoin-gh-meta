      "body" : "This was one of my gripes as well when nLockTime was started to be added by default. Note that there is some mitigation for this by randomizing the nLockTime in one of then cases:\r\n```c++\r\n    // Secondly occasionally randomly pick a nLockTime even further back, so\r\n    // that transactions that are delayed after signing for whatever reason,\r\n    // e.g. high-latency mix networks and some CoinJoin implementations, have\r\n    // better privacy.\r\n    if (GetRandInt(10) == 0)\r\n        txNew.nLockTime = std::max(0, (int)txNew.nLockTime - GetRandInt(100));\r\n```\r\nSo up-to-date nodes will occasionally send older locktimes as well.\r\n\r\nThere might be additional privacy improvements possible, of course.",
