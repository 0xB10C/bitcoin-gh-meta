      "body" : "Thanks @TheBlueMatt . I originally didn't add logging to proxy_test.py because it was printing in `__int__()`, which is before logging has been set up. Looking a bit closer, it's very easy to move the logic from `__init__()` into `setup_nodes()`, which I think is where it belongs.\r\n\r\nnulldummy.py was just an oversight.\r\n\r\nI'll squash these commits once they've been reviewed.\r\n\r\n",
