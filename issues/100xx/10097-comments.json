In general it's\n> better if test_runner.py has no knowledge of special cases for\n> individual tests and is a general purpose test runner.\n> ------------------------------\n> You can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\n>\n>   https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10097\n> Commit Summary\n>\n>    - Move zmq test skipping logic into individual test case.\n>\n> File Changes\n>\n>    - *M* test/functional/test_runner.py\n>    <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10097/files#diff-0> (25)\n>    - *M* test/functional/zmq_test.py\n>    <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10097/files#diff-1> (21)\n>\n> Patch Links:\n>\n>    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10097.patch\n>    - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10097.diff\n>\n> Ã¢ÂÂ\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10097>, or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AGGmv4BZGpuh9duLpkF5cPOQke7I_8zmks5rp-CdgaJpZM4MqfhX>\n> .\n>\n",
