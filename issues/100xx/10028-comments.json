      "body" : "Bitcoin Core's maintainers do not, and do not want to, decide what the network's rules are. If there is widespread agreement about a change, it will be merged. But if you want to rally for such a change, the correct place is in public fora that involve the whole community, not on the issue tracker of just one software project.\n\nAs far as me individually and several others are concerned, we have gone through a large scale effort to bring a capacity increase in a safe and backward-compatible way, known as SegWit. At this point it is out of our hands and up to the community to adopt it. So please don't accuse people of inaction.",
