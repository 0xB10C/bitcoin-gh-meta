   "body" : "### Describe the issue\r\nWhen setting up the gui to connect through tor, bitcoin-cli commands fail to work if accessed through the Windows command prompt with a message about failing to get rpc credentials. This problem does not occur for me once I revert those settings.\r\n\r\n### Can you reliably reproduce the issue?\r\n#### If so, please list the steps to reproduce below:\r\n1. Start bitcoin-qt on Windows 7, using a custom data directory.\r\n2. In settings > network, set proxy and tor checkboxes and connect through 127.0.0.1:9150 for both.\r\n3. While tor is running and there are active connections to the bitcoin network, attempt any bitcoin-cli command from the command prompt, for example bitcoin-cli help\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nNormally this would result in the help text for bitcoin-cli being displayed.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nInstead, I receive this text:\r\nerror: Could not locate RPC credentials. No authentication cookie could be found, and no rpcpassword is set in the configuration file (C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin.conf)\r\n\r\nSetting an rpcpassword value in bitcoin.conf yields:\r\nerror: couldn't connect to server: EOF reached (code 1)\r\n(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)\r\n\r\nServer is set to 1. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What version of bitcoin-core are you using?\r\n0.14.0 official binary\r\n\r\n### Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process.\r\nIf needed I can provide a debug.log; I'm not sure if that would be valuable in this instance. Happy to provide any other information..",
