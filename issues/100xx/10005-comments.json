Here is a gist of the entire debug.log @TheBlueMatt https://gist.github.com/sheldonth/2ba09ba625375bee7f2f64957ca4fe10\r\n\r\nI have yet to be able to get the QT UI to appear. I am using 0.14 -- one factor to note is that my bitcoin data directory is on an external drive which also had Time Machine backups start on it (automatically) while bitcoin was trying to open. I realized this morning that I was simultaneously Time Machine'ing a backup onto the same drive that Bitcoin was working off of. I wonder if that could've casued the locks referred to above. Since I can currently reproduce the problem I will try starting bitcoin with the -debug flag and sending any other logs over. ",
