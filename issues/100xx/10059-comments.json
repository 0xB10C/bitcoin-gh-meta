      "body" : "If your going to start removing specific Boost functions, I'd suggest looking over the codebase and seeing if it makes sense to remove all usages in one go, to save lots of similar pull requests. It also make review easier.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we only have two usages of ```ends_with```, in core_read.cpp and netbase.cpp.\r\n\r\nThere are 5 usages of ```starts_with``` (the 16 in leveldb/ don't count) in bitcoind.cpp, core_read.cpp, netbase.cpp, wallet/rpcdump.cpp and util.cpp as you've removed here.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest updating this PR to remove all usages of both. Then please update the PR title, and drop [trivial].\r\n",

Will update this with those other usages.\r\n\r\nIn the past I've been told that sweeping refactors (such as my for-each PR: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8801) are generally discouraged and to update things as they are touched.  Obviously this isn't as large of a set of changes, so I'm still working on finding the right balance.\r\n\r\nThanks for the pointer.",
