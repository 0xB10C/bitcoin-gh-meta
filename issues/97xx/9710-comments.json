Something like:\r\n\r\n\"bitcoind started with -zapwallettxes, but there is a mempool file in the data directory. Unconfirmed transactions in the mempool file may be scanned and re-added to the wallet. To remove all unconfirmed transactions, you may wish to delete the mempool.dat file from your data directory.\"\r\n\r\nIf users are finding it too onerous to remove the mempool.dat file manually we could add a `-mempoolerase` option.\r\n\r\nSound good?",
