   "body" : "Fix test fragility described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8456#issuecomment-272256286\r\n\r\n>I ran into a lot of spurious errors related to `fundrawtransaction` in the bumpfee tests while trying to add a simple test for this. fundrawtransaction would sometimes chose different sized inputs than the `small_output_fails` and `dust_to_fee tests` were expecting, so I rewrote these tests in 13960f870c1ba94f391012f9c9243c59951ea6ab to manually create RBF transactions with the right inputs.\r\n>\r\n>I also ran into problems with `fundrawtransaction` using up all the right-sized inputs before these tests could use them, so I changed the order of the tests so they would run before any fundrawtransaction calls.\r\n>\r\n>I also ran into problems with `fundrawtransaction` sometimes chosing a higher fee for the RBF transaction than the `test_rebumping` test expected, causing the bumpfee command in the test to fail with an \"Invalid totalFee, must be at least ...\" error. I did not figure out what was causing this, but it seemed to somehow be related to the number of `peer_node.sendtoaddress(rbf_node_address, 0.001)` calls made during the test setup.",
