      "body" : "> I've set MAX_MAX_SIG_CACHE_SIZE absurdly high (16GB) for now, so setting maxsigcachesize to anything unreasonably large will still cause a bad_alloc for most users. Input welcomed on what a more reasonable MAX_MAX_SIG_CACHE_SIZE should be, or whether we should leave it out entirely.\r\n\r\nI'd say that is reasonable. We don't want bad_alloc for negative amounts (which you fixed), but if the user specifies a higher value than available memory then it's what you expect. Even better error handling would catch the bad_alloc and print a friendly error message, but that's overdoing it in this particular case.",
