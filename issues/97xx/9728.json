   "body" : "I will add tests to this PR if there is some interests to use it in Core.\r\nThe user create a new wallet by removing the old wallet.dat and running `./bitcoind -hdwatchonly=[ExtPubKey base58]`.\r\n\r\nThe advantage in doing it that way is that software built on top of core do not need to much different code path in order to outsource their key signing operations to an hardware wallet, rather than storing the keys in core.\r\n\r\nI will use it in my own projects. My HW is giving me the ExtPubKey, and I want to use bitcoin core just for coin selection and tracking. I also did not wanted to break bunch of old code. Ping @jonasschnelli \r\n",
