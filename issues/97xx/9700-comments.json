I know you prefer primitives/* to be very dumb-data-storage objects, but since CTransaction is const, it would be quite a waste to not use that to store any precomputed thing we can in it. @sdaftuar had a previous version of this patch that made CTransactionRef a wrapper around a shared_ptr to the CTransaction as well as the precomputed data, but that, too, goes in primitives and ended up just being more complication for no reason.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we're already halfway between \"dumb storage\" and \"precalculated\" anyway, since we precalculate the hash and store that. The distinction of not precalculating the witness hashes seems arbitrary to me.",
