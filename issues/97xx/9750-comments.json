When a function is larger than trivial size, such an assurance helps you to quickly read and understand a function. If you know that the value of side won't change, then you don't have to worry about keeping track of its value over time as you read. Under some circumstances, this might even help the compiler generate better code.\r\n\r\n> A non-trivial number of people do this as a matter of course, considering it generally good style.\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/8714250/isnt-const-redundant-when-passing-by-value\r\n\r\nThere is no harm to making this change, and at best, there is the gain that the above sorts of bug won't later be introduced. Also, in theory such an annotation could help the optimizer better inline such a function.\r\n",
