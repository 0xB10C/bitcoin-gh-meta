   "body" : "This is supposed to address the concern from @gmaxwell in #9761 that importmulti rescans on pruned nodes could unsuccessfully scan pruned blocks and fail to inform the user.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach of just simply disabling importmulti rescans on pruned nodes was initially discussed in https://botbot.me/freenode/bitcoin-core-dev/msg/81023921/, but running being able to import keys and do partial rescans on pruned nodes was determined to be an important use-case.\r\n\r\nPosting this PR for feedback. The code has not been tested at all, and I'm actually not sure how I'm going to go about writing a unit test because there doesn't seem to be an easy way to target individual blocks for pruning inside RPC tests.",
