There will only be incoming connections if your node listens and the listen port is reachable. The number of outgoing connections will never exceed 8. It has nothing to do with who requests blocks from who, bitcoin P2P connections are bidirectional in that regard.\r\n\r\n2. Sure, the colors could be swapped, I have nothing against that. Or maybe using red and green is not a good idea at all as people ascribe good/bad meaning to them (and some colorblind can't distinguish them - at my last employer this was informally called \"the christmas tree effect\").",

This still induces some conflict with those who don't know the terminology and try to reconcile data on these two tabs. I don't know, maybe \"in\" and \"out\" should have different names on the Network Traffic tab (like \"uploaded\"/\"downloaded\" or something else).\r\n\r\n2. Yeah, the logic was very reduced and generalized here (\"good\", \"bad\", etc), to make it commonly understood. You could use different colors, but without colors I don't know how to effectively distinguish them - using different line strokes may be an option but seems inadequate.",

As I remember, in master (which will be 0.10.x) the in/out in the bandwidth chart window has already been changed to received/sent.\r\n\r\n2) I'm all for using colors, but I'm open to using more neutral ones which are easier to distinguish for color blind people. But I don't really mind here, the chart is just for fun and is not essential to using the program.\r\n",
