With my code, this is mitigated significantly, and it's highly unlikely and unusual for a node to not start sending a block within 10 seconds of it being requested - this is based on over two years of testing. On what are you basing your argument?",

Effectively a two minute timeout increases the minimum bandwidth that can keep a node running bitcoin by more than 5 fold. This of behavior means that moderate or short lived DOS attacks (or just high utilization) can cause disconnection potentially allowing an attacker to partition the network.\r\n\r\nYesÃ¢ÂÂ malicious nodes attacking the network can potentially slow down receiving blocks (and thats still true with your change). This is part of why the standard advice (and widespread practice) for mining nodes is to not expose them to the public network directly. Increasing partition risk, or reducing the ability to run slow or overloaded links at all isn't a good trade-off.\r\n\r\nI'd really encourage you to spend time testing headers first.",
