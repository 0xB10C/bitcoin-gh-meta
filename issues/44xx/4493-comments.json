So does that mean its not a deadlock risk in actuality?  Although the LOCK() calls are in the opposite order, there may be no chance of deadlock?",

If they are all TRY_LOCKS then indeed a deadlock cannot happen, but maybe livelock or thread starvation could (if both threads refuse to give up the other lock after getting the other one fails).\r\n\r\nAs for IsInitialBlockDownload: one idea would be to change it to return a global flag that is cleared only after the initial block download (+ check at initialization time). This would be more efficient than executing the checks every time as well.\r\n\r\n",
