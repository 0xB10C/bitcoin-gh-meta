      "body" : "@sipa I understand that your benchmarks have been maybe in hash/s which is what someone CPU mining with bitcoind in either mainnet or testnet would care about. My point is, as discussed we want to maintain the regtest miner which we use for testing. So my question was, did anybody tested how the performance of the tests suffers with this?\r\nIt is plausible that is even faster.\r\n\r\nAnyway there's other solutions to encapsulate the proof of work related parts of miner.o in pow.o without removing the optimization so I think it's worth asking here.\r\nThe most obvious solution was to move the whole optimization to the Proof class, which @laanwj and I dislike.\r\nI'm open to code several possibilities to help people chose what they like most. \r\n\r\nBut in my opinion one thing is clear: all of them will look much nicer if I can just get rid of the hashmeter first.\r\nWould anybody oppose to the removal of the hashmeter?\r\nUsers of bitcoind's miner hashmeter, show yourselves.\r\nOh, wait, @sipa were you using that for the benchmark?\r\nMhmm, if so, it is not a fair comparison since my version works more for the hashmeter, look https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4423/files#diff-4a59b408ad3778278c3aeffa7da33c3cL519\r\n\r\nAnyway, jokes apart, I'm just looking for some more feedback on how to encapsulate the mining part of the pow in the Proof class.\r\nI promise that if my regtest-only argument it's not convincing, I won't insist like I did with CTxDestination.",
