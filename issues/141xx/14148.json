   "body" : "When a block reward is spent together with other outputs in the wallet and that block reward is later orphaned, the wallet does not show the other funds as available anymore.  Even a `-rescan` is not enough - only `-zapwallettxes` or an explicit `abandontransaction` \"recovers\" the funds.  I prepared a [test case](https://github.com/domob1812/bitcoin/blob/wallet-bug-invalidated-block-rewards/test/functional/wallet_bug.py) that shows this behaviour.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue or the expected behaviour?  While this situation is something that will presumably not occur in practice (as it requires a long reorg), I wonder if that transaction should be automatically abandoned as it seems clear it won't be able to be confirmed anymore.",
