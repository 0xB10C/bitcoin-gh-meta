   "body" : "This introduces a new BlockFilterIndex class, which is required for BIP 157 support.\r\n\r\nThe PR is massive and can be broken up if reviewers would like, but I opened one big one to start with for completeness. The RPC method and some of the early refactoring commits are good candidates to separate out.\r\n\r\nMain design questions:\r\n- The PR currently puts the index for each block filter type in a separate database. An alternative would be to have one LevelDB database for all filter indexes, and put each one under a different key prefix. The difference is minimal right now since BIP 158 only defines one filter type.\r\n- Should the `CBlockUndo` be added as a parameter to the `ValidationInterface::BlockConnected` callback like in #14035?\r\n\r\nStats (block height = 539700):\r\n- Syncing the index from scratch takes 52m\r\n- Total index size is 3.4 GiB\r\n\r\nDepends on:\r\n- #14085 \r\n- #14172",
