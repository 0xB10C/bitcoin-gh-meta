We need to be able to cross compile binaries for all targets that we do binary releases for from a linux build system due to gitian. For developers on Windows we do have [msvc build](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/build_msvc) support already.\r\n\r\nOne issue with cmake is that it's a makefile generator while autoconf is a configure script generator, the configure script created by autoconf is designed to be portable, there isn't really a direct equivalent with cmake AFAIK. In general autoconf projects are considered easier to work with for people packaging software even though the build system may be somewhat more complex to maintain.",
