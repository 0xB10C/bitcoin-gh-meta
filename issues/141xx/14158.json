   "body" : "This is C++, inline functions in a headers do not need to be `static`. Making it so is a pessimization as it will generate functions with internal linkage in every translation unit including the header. (Note that `inline` in C is different from `inline` in C++).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a static function in a cpp file already has internal linkage, making it `inline` has no effect.\r\n\r\nTemplates already have an inline-like property of being allowed to be defined multiple times, and having the linker deal with it. Making them `inline` is also redundant.\r\n\r\nThis change does 3 things:\r\n1. removes `static` from all inlined functions in header files\r\n2. removes `inline` from all `static inline` functions in .cpp files\r\n3. removes `inline` from templates",
