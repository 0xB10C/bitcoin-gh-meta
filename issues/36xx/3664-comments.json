Probably deprecate it. \"label address\" wouldn't really be a sensible thing.\r\n",

      "body" : "@laanwj what is the different between label and account? I need a move command to mirror my internal account system. I am ok with how accounts work at the moment, but it's quite non-obvious how to implement intermediary applications on top of bitcoind. \r\n\r\nA basic use case is this. some merchant/exchange (trusted third party TTP) manages his own ledger. the users have accounts with that TTP. the TTP implements his own (web-) application, which has concepts of users, accounts and balances. the TTP provides a BTC address for deposits. The question is what gets done by an account system (application layer) and bitcoind (address/wallet layer). All of these transactions on the TTP ledger are internal to his wallet. \r\n\r\nSo the needed bitcoind base operations would be:\r\n* set label (label <=> address)\r\n* unset label (balance goes to the \"main\" label)\r\n* move (labelA to labelB)\r\n\r\nThe application operations would be:\r\n* map user to BTC address for deposits (user <=> label <=> address)\r\n* withdrawal function\r\n* transact function (moving balances from userA to userB)\r\n* users and labels are mapped in this database and synced\r\n\r\nEach request from the web application needs a sync with the application database, which is a costly operation. It would be better to have a hook mechanism, so that any outside transaction has a callback.\r\n\r\nIt might be a good idea to have an opensource sample application to describe some use cases in detail. I'm not sure what other consumers of bitcoind expect from such an intermediary layer.",
