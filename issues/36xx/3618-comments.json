It also made the whole (Bitcoin) program very slow at times of high resource contention. (although that might be better if only one thread was running at low IO priority). I don't think this feature was designed with programs with constant IO in mind, it turns off read ahead (and does various other things) so it can stop HD reading at a moment's notice and not impact other programs. I witnessed significant blocking (in the programming sense) when syncing the block chain, the TCP window was almost always full while downloading slowly. Back to normal IO (relaunch) -- 50x faster.\r\n\r\nBut for a high IO program like Bitcoin low IO priority makes the HD thrash like crazy. It didn't make the _computer_ slower than bitcoin with normal IO even with all that thrashing (IO priority works great. [Thanks Win7!]). I don't think this is a good idea to use for bitcoin.",
