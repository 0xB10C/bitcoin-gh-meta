(or some more complicated scriptPubKey with an or like property).  A transaction singing with one key may be very different from the user's perspective, and which of A or B signed may have substantial contractual or legal implications.\r\n\r\nOr flipping the other way, consider transactions made ANYONE_CAN_PAY purposefully so that more inputs can be added to boost fees without resigning (but could be changed by other people too). These are still effectively the same transactionÃ¢ÂÂ pay the same people, achieve the same purpose, yet their normalized IDs would change.  (I understand a large bitcoin company is planning on using these soon). \"Oh no, malleability is back!\"Ã¢ÂÂ if you wrote your wallet assuming the normalized IDs won't change out from under you and you start getting lots of payments from the aforementioned unmentioned company, you may be in for a surprise.\r\n  \r\nJust some food for though.

As @gmaxwell explains in his second post it may not be possible to come up with a generic 'normalized txid' that satisfies everyone and every use case. So the focus has to be narrowed to something practical. They want an ID to track a specific network transaction.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be invariant under coinjoin and other input/output mangling you should use the destination address for tracking. That's a different use-case though.\r\n",

As MtGox asked for this, I published my proposal for that on the mailing list, and now here as a pull request to simplify testing. Someone will have to come up with test vectors, compare implementations, check that it satisfies all requirements, and maybe write a BIP (sorry, I currently don't have time for this myself).\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think the implementation as such (or it being accepted in the reference client codebase) is that important. The purpose was to set a standard. I don't think we can force one, especially as it is not something that affects the protocol or the reference client directly. If people want to see it deployed, ask that services adopt it.\r\n\r\nBack to this implemnentation: I do believe that (IF the reference client adopts this standard, which can be independent from whether other services do), we need to be able to look up wallet transactions by it. The opposite would be encouraging a feature that only works with the presence of centralized block chain indexing services.",

Now, in the long run, you may end up with 2 unrelated transactions in the blockchain with different TXID (common) but with the same normalized TXID (very very improbable). \r\n\r\nOr said in another way: very very improbable, but a new transaction can be issued and latter confirmed, which could have the same normalized TXID than an unrelated previous transaction in the blockchain (that previous transaction having a different TXID and either be spent or not). The normalized TXID gives the impression of a unique ID that seams misleading. \r\n\r\nIf this is not dealt properly then normalized TXID is king of a cheap fix and should only be used as an internal tool for individuals (or exchanges) at their own risk of getting confusing info (again very improbable, but then again, the blockchain deals with this).",

      "body" : "@sipa, BIP34 guarantees that 2 coinbase transactions cannot have the same content (whole transaction content, by adding the block's height in its scriptSig). Thus stopping the trivial reappearance of the same TXID in the blockchain for coinbase transactions (and also for subsequent transactions in their spending chains).\r\n\r\nBut it is important to clearly state that TXIDs are not guarantied to be unique (I believe that there is no validation of this in the code, but maybe I am mistaken and would like to be clarified). Now with BIP34 it is highly improbable for 2 transactions to have the same TXID. No one can trivially duplicate TXIDs as it was possible before, but that does not guaranties uniqueness (And yes, there maybe not enough time in the universe to come up with a duplicated TXID now, I know). \r\n\r\nEven if enforcement of unique TXID is introduced in the blockchain, it would not guarantee NTXID uniqueness, it would just continue to be very improbable and not trivial.  \r\n\r\nThings should be addressed as they are so no misconceptions get spread so this patch and other alternatives can be better compared/evaluated.\r\n\r\nAgain, if NTXID is introduced, I would suggest it should have its own format in order to differentiate it from other elements.

      "body" : "I don't think this should be considered as standard. My reasoning follows. I would strongly prefer this to be considered as best-practice only as there are clearly some benefits of using this, but this is only limited to specific scenarios and even this is limited to current situation where malleability of transactions is possible. This is a this temporally solution to a design flaw of Bitcoin protocol and by making this \"hot-fix\" a standard we are accepting this flaw as something correctly designed.\r\n\r\n  * Standards are here to make cooperation between *different* parties easier and in many cases even possible.\r\n  * Proposed approach does not brings any benefit to cooperation between different parties because it is by design created to be used by sending party only\r\n  * The primary goal of normalized transaction hashes is to allow sending party to identify their own transaction and match it to possible muttated versions of it. There is a obvious benefit for sending party to know if that concrete transaction made it into the blockchain and this can be done only by matching muttated versions.\r\n  * For the receiving party to make sure that a concrete transaction made it to the blockchain there already exist a way to do so and using normalized transaction id for this purpose therefor does not bring any benefit. In fact using normalized transaction hash is more difficult than current available methods as a new hash need to be obtained from the sender. If the receiving party chooses to it can simple do this tracking by using different receiving address for every transaction.\r\n  * Normalized transaction hash cannot be used by receiving party for accounting purposes contrary to usage by the sending party. \r\n  * As there is not a single usage of normalized transaction hash by receiving party that cannot be done by already available means there isn't actually any reason for receiving party to bother about it or know it.\r\n  * As there is no need to publish this new hash by sending party because there is no external benefit for doing so, this hash should be kept internal.\r\n  * As normalized transaction hash is only used internally by sending party, it's computation is not dependent on any internal structures or inner working of bitcoin client software, it is computable from a standalone transaction, this computation can be done by external application and it's usage is applicable strictly outside the bitcoin software, we should not \"enforce\" a way to compute this hash and let this to a decision of sending party.\r\n  * When/if malleability of transactions is properly resolved this new hash will be creating no other benefit for the sending party compared to using regular transaction id. this duplication should be avoided in front and making this a standard would make it much harder in future to get rid of.",

Automatic correction of up to two errors in input, and highly probable detection of non-recoverable errors.\r\n3. Normative ids begin with the characters \"tx\"\r\n4. Visually distinctive grouping of 8 \r\n\r\nThe purpose of these changes is not to bring additional security, but rather to accomplish goals which will save time and money for customer-service operations:\r\n\r\n1. Make normative IDs and protocol transaction IDs visually distinctive so as to prevent user confusion. \"I just read you the hash, what other number are you looking for?\"\r\n2. Correct small transcription errors, of the sort which inevitably result from reading a string of 64 digits/numbers over the phone in a customer support scenario.\r\n3. Provide visual grouping to assist in human transcription from paper or 2nd device, or over the phone.\r\n\r\nThe result is a normative ID that would look like the following:\r\n\r\n    tx5x14j6-5cqqkytc-tq646pss-2hq3sm6k-pw1vxz1m-r7jkkjsy-ts0rx1dx-f79mv3jw\r\n\r\nI'm expecting a reviewable pull request to be done today, if all goes well.",

      "body" : "@T4Truth This normalized hash stuff doesn't have anything to do with coin lossÃ¢ÂÂ the kind of doubled payments you're talking about can only be prevented by making sure the reissued transaction conflicts with the original, giving you atomic exclusion. Nothing else is safe, since nothing else prevent both txn from going in (even if the inputs were already conflicted by another transaction, due to the possibility of a reorg).\r\n\r\nWhat this is supposed to help with is the user confusion related to a giving the user one txid and having another show up. Since some transaction types are inherently malleable (as a feature!) this can't work for all transaction types, but for the common, boring ones, it could. For internal use, there are better things that you can do, like finding the conflicting transaction and actually comparing it (allowing you to also handle ordinary double-spends).\r\n\r\nI don't think any of the core developers here view this particular piece of software as a high priority right now, relative to the DOS bugfixes, however.  Probably the discussion for this should move to the mailing lists like other ecosystem standards stuff.  Regardless, a second independent implementation will really be needed to move it forward. @maaku You weren't planning on writing a second implementation, by any chance?",

There is also the fact that people using regular bitcoind as backend won't be able to do that either.\r\n\r\nKeeping only a service-specific ID stored in the transaction is not a solution either, as it would be difficult to index globally (ie. we have to find the right txs from the whole blockchain).\r\n\r\nAnyway we came up  with this new hash solution because:\r\n- it requires no change to the protocol and will not cause any forks or issue to people not using it\r\n- because bitcoind already has facilities to exclude the txin script from a tx to hash it,  it is very easy to implement\r\n- because it's a hash of what is actually signed, anything causing this hash to change would also invalidate the signature\r\n\r\nAs for CoinJoin, I believe the client will have a view of the transaction before it is actually sent (to ensure it includes its outputs and to sign it). As such it is perfectly possible to fetch this hash at that stage, even before knowing the actual tx hash (and it could remove the need for the client to see the actual tx to know its hash as they potentially wouldn't need it anymore)",

      "body" : "@MagicalTux   Reissuing a transaction without reusing the inputs is unsafe. You cannot do this and be confident you will not be robbed, because there is nothing preventing both transactions from going through. No amount of checking can provide protection in that case, because the prior transaction may not have gone through _yet_ but still may go through for as long as it has not been conflictedÃ¢ÂÂ or even after it has been, if the conflict can be removed in a reorg. It may be slow, it may not work super well, but it is the _only_ way to prevent transactions from being paid twice. This has nothing to do with malleability: You simply cannot pay someone twice and not risk them actually getting paid twice, unless their original payment is impossible or the transactions are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nIf including this patch is going to make even one service believe they can safely reissue in this manner than we must not do it.\r\n\r\nPull requests here are not used to define standards, normally \"standards\"Ã¢ÂÂ in so far as we have them at all in the Bitcoin communityÃ¢ÂÂ are defined using BIPs.  The GitHub page was a quick way to get code up so that people could start commenting on itÃ¢ÂÂ and get it if they needed something to use internally to help sort things out.\r\n\r\nIt is not our responsibility to run your service, so if you're waiting on anything on this pull req you are doing something wrong.  You already issue several kinds of mtgox proprietary ID with your transactions. \r\n\r\n> anything causing this hash to change would also invalidate the signature\r\n\r\nThis isn't true for all transactions, it's true for the conventional ones you issueÃ¢ÂÂ indeed. Some transaction types are inherently malleable and no ID can be both unique and non-malleable for them.\r\n\r\n> Keeping only a service-specific ID stored in the transaction is not a solution either, as it would be difficult to index globally\r\n\r\nI am not a fan of putting an extra ID in transactions because it bloats them, it's bad for privacy, and can potentially be simulated in other transactions (unless you go through the heroic effort of making it a signature)...  But there is no reason why it should be any more difficult to index than any other data from a transaction.  Instead of running the normalized ID extraction, you run the service ID extraction, and index that if there is one.\r\n",

It seems at the moment the only way to properly \"cancel\" previous transaction which failed to be confirmed is to spend at least one of it's inputs. But what if that fails as well? Then you have yet another stuck transaction to worry about and keep track of.. Would it be possible to add something opposite to nLockTime, time or block height after which transaction becomes expired and should not be included into a block?",

The point is that the method of achieving this speed benefit is strongly bound to business category and these categories nor methods hasn't been even enumerated yet. This proposal is a best-practice for one of this category and one method but is presented as been a magical standard solution for everybody.

The customer Y wants to withdraw.\n\n* Y requests payment (out of band, http for example)\n\n* I perform a payment.\n\nNow either I can CLAIM to have made the transaction, and the user has to\nwait 10*x where x >= 1 to know if I'm right. OR I can give him the txid.\n\nIf X gives him the txid it might get malleaded and fail and cause a big\nfuzz. This is not a neat choice, but might be the best we can do.\n\nX could give Y metainfo, like which inputs were spent. This is pretty\ncomplicated. X could give the whole transaction. That's not at all easier.\n\nX could issue a proprietary ID. Then the only place to check on the tx\nwould be X's service or those allied with X. Y likely doesn't have any\ncapacity for checking.\n\nThus: Mt Gox asks for a unique ID for unverified transactions. The use case\nbeing pre-confirm communication. This is considered to be important.\n\nSuch an ID Y can dump into his client and see \"transaction in network\",\n\"transaction might be next in block\", \"transaction confirmed once\" and\nafter a few \"transaction confirmed\" (when cost-of-falsify > value of tx).\nEven if Y unknowing.\n\nInternally this ID might help X. Especially interesting will be the\nconfirmed once then reverted in another, longer, chain with a different\ntxid bugs.\n\nOn the flip side I have to say it is disappointing to see Mtgox crash our\nfine currency like this. It has a lot of people very worried about what's\nreally happened. Extra so as it is very much solvable by Mtgox itself,\nalthough the solution would not be as pretty.\n\nBottom line I am buying and hoping Mtgox is secretly working in a fix akin\nto Coinbase's fix, to reopen withdrawals ASAP.\n\nFurthermore I would like to see a txid be something that can not be\nchanged, like an output could not be changed. As this malleability thing is\nhard to spell and confusing.\n\nI think Mtgox should reopen and this problem must be given its fair\nattention.\n\nFor now this is not standardized in a BIP and is not fixable. I wouldn't\nmind a \"practical standard\" for now, but this is not my decision.\n\nCheers.",

Normalized transaction hashes try but are not by definition unique and sender needs to put out large effort to assert that transaction which he issues has non-colliding ntxid with another one already included in the blockchain if he wishes to use this hash for accounting purporses or eg. as a relation databases' key.\r\n\r\nFrom BIP0030:\r\n> Blocks are not allowed to contain a transaction whose identifier matches that of an earlier, not-fully-spent transaction in the same chain.\r\n\r\nReverting this it is possible and legal for a transaction with identical txid to by included in the blockchain in multiple copies. \r\n\r\nBIP0030 s enforcing the uniqueness only on the set of transactions which have each one or more unspend output. Proposed ntxid is not reducing this set of transactions in any way as this global uniqueness in the chain is here one of the main desired properties. Making sure that this uniqueness is not broken requires for every client to maintain an index of every transaction ntxid in the blockchain and to check for potential colision on every signing of transaction. It is possible and probable, that such cases breaking this uniqueness are already included in the blockchain and together with high cost this brings to assert this uniqueness this proposal has high potential of causing hard-forks.\r\n\r\nI now personally declare this proposal as broken by design.",

The patch in this pull request has the potential to result in duplicate ntxid's for coinbase transactions since the coinbase string which contains the BIP-34 block height is a scriptSig and therefore stripped from the normative data structure. At this time I cannot imagine why you would need a normalized transaction ID for a coinbase transaction. But just because I can't imagine a use doesn't mean there isn't one, and services indexing the block chain need to make a decision about this edge case.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the code now provides error correction coding for arbitrary length base32 strings, and complete coverage with a suite of unit tests. It also corrects two bugs that were found in the encoding algorithm, which were uncovered in the process of writing the tests. All that remains to be done is to write a BIP documenting its inner workings.",
