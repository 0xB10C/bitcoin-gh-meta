This is really weird.\r\n\r\nOne possible reason is that the VM building in gitian master changed since I did it (and it no longer includes g++ by default?). We had a similar problem with the disk size that was increased to 10GB. Some people still had old images and couldn't build the Qt dep due to lack of space. So maybe we need to add a recommendation to re-generate your `precise` images even if you already have them...\r\n\r\nEdit: going to re-generate images and see. \r\nEdit2: WIth pristine images dependency building still goes fine. I don't get it. Somehow, the setup must make a difference.\r\n",
