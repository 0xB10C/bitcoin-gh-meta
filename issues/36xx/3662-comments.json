These issues need to be handled altogether differently.\r\n\r\n[and](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3661#issuecomment-34940046):\r\n\r\n>> **sipa:** That's a confusion that afaik as existed forever in the source code: IsConfirmed should be called IsTrusted or something instead (it means confirmed OR from ourselves).\r\n\r\n> But the larger point is that a transaction from oneself cannot actually be trusted; due to transaction mutability, any source other than the blockchain itself is irrelevant (for various degrees of risk aversion). So, this is not just a question of naming; it's a question of real risk.\r\n\r\n> When you think about it, you cannot be terribly miffed about this larger point, because that's all Bitcoin ever proffered, anyway: \"Data buried in the blockchain is what can be trusted.\" It's better to work with that reality rather than against it.",
