I wouldnt expect it there either, but it works for me.\r\n\r\nIn the addressbookpage.cpp, we have set ResizeToContents on the last column, to ensure its contents are always visible. I think this might be a good idea for the new receive-tab and also the transactions-tab too. So unless there is any other very important reason, why someone would want to resize the last column, I would rather say we consider this as an upstream qt problem.",
