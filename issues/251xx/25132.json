   "body" : "BIP 341 specifies [constraints on the size of the control block _c_ used to compute the taproot merkle root](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#script-validation-rules).\r\n\r\n> The last stack element is called the control block _c_, and must have length _33 + 32m_, for a value of _m_ that is an integer between 0 and 128, inclusive. Fail if it does not have such a length.\r\n\r\nThe actual merkle root is computed in `ComputeTaprootMerkleRoot` ([interpreter.cpp@1833](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1833)) - this code does _not_ check these constraints.\r\n\r\nAll the callers do check the constraints before calling `ComputeTaprootMerkleRoot`.  But in the future there may be more callers, and these checks may be inadvertently omitted at those future calls.  Therefore _this PR adds those checks as `asserts` directly in `ComputeTaprootMerkleRoot`_ to help prevent that error.\r\n\r\nNo unit tests provided: they'd have to be death tests as these are `assert` statements which raise `SIGABRT` and kill the program.  Boost Test has a way to implement death tests (see the in-progress draft PR #25097 at [this code (you may have to click to expand the diff)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25097/files#diff-21483d0e032747850208f21325b29cde89e9c1f55f83a7a166a388cc5c27115aR1089) and could be added here if desired by reviewers.\r\n\r\nCurrent callers of `ComputeTaprootMerkleRoot`:\r\n- `InferTaprootTree` ([standard.cpp@1552](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/standard.cpp#L546))\r\n- `VerifyTaprootCommittment` ([interpreter.cpp@1859](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1859)) does a partial check, but it is called from `VerifyWitnessProgram` ([interpreter.cpp@1922](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L1918)) where a full check is done\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst.
