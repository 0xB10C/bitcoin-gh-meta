   "body" : "Backport of #24498 to 22.x branch\r\n\r\nThis was already backported to the 23.x branch in #24511, but vasild discovered the issue can affect 22.x as well https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15936#issuecomment-1115992866:\r\n\r\n> While testing this, 22.x crashes if `settings.json` contains `\"prune\": 1234` due to #24498 which was fixed in 23.0. So, if this PR is included in 24.x and a user upgrades to 24.x and then downgrades to 22.x his 22.x would crash at startup.\r\n\r\nIt's not very important to backport this to 22.x because I can work around the issue other ways, but I do see 22.x is listed as an active branch https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/branches, so if there is another 22.x release, it would be nice to have this fix and not have a wonky uncaught univalue exception waiting to be hit\r\n",
