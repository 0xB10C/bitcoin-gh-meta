As opposed to `net.cpp` including everything it needs (that is, adding https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/e0f804a0090b54e25b5742da422d8ca510960724 to this PR, or wouldn't have to be this PR I guess).\r\n\r\nAs is (without this other commit), `net.cpp` compiles, but it may not in the future if one of the headers it includes stops including (for example) `chrono`, which `net.cpp` uses. In contrast, if that commit _is_ merged, then `net.cpp` is more resilient to changes outside of itself (changes in other header files). The downside of adding those includes is that compiling is slower (even though they're just redundant includes so not that bad).\r\n\r\nI'm probably not explaining this well, making it more complicated than it is, but do I have this right?\r\n\r\nIf so, my opinion is that it _would_ be good to add that commit, but I don't feel strongly either way.",
