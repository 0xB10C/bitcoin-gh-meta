      "body" : "Actually I don't think they are different behavior. They just are set and checked at different times so these two variables appear to be controlling different things.\r\n\r\nIf `m_add_inputs == false`, then we only filter for the preset inputs in `AvailableCoins`. If `fAllowOtherInputs == false`, we also only filter for the preset inputs in `AvailableCoins`. In `SelectCoins`, if `fAllowOtherInputs == false`, we have an optimization where we just select all of the preset inputs and exit early. For `m_add_inputs == false`, we don't do the optimization but instead select all of the inputs, do the coin selection algorithms, and arrive at the same selection of all of the preset inputs. So these two options fundamentally do the same thing and could actually be unified.\r\n\r\nThere is some weird interactions between then, such as when `m_add_inputs == false`, but `fAllowOtherInputs` is force set to `true` in `FundTransaction` - in this case `m_add_inputs` \"overrides\" `fAllowOtherInputs`, but it just isn't as obvious that it does. This would definitely be cleared up if they were the same variable.\r\n\r\nSo there is no need to introduce `m_use_manual_selection`.",
