In SelectCoins, if fAllowOtherInputs == false, we have an optimization where we just select all of the preset inputs and exit early.

So these two options fundamentally do the same thing and could actually be unified.\r\n\r\nI came to the same conclusion but.. the reason behind the new flag are all the `AvailableCoins` checks prior appending the coins to the `vCoins` vector that are being skipped in the second part of the `SelectCoins` process (where it loops over the `CoinControl` manually selected outputs and forcibly adds them to the tx, getting them from the wallet tx map directly instead of looking them inside `vCoins`..).\r\n\r\nIn other words, the usage of `m_add_inputs=true` was telling the wallet: \"add this outputs as inputs into the tx; don't care if they are spent, locked or whatever state they are. Just add them\".\r\nWhile `HasSelected() + fAllowOtherInputs=false` is a \"add this outputs as inputs into the tx only if they are in a valid state, not locked, with enough depth, etc\".\r\n\r\nAn easy example of this is the locked coins skip that is inside `AvailableCoins` but not in the second part of `SelectCoins`:\r\n\r\nThe locked coins are, forcibly, selected inside the second part of `SelectCoins` while they were skipped inside `AvailableCoins`.. so if I change the current behavior (which I agree that is completely redundant: further notes below) and use the first part of the `SelectCoins` process: as the locked coins aren't inside `vCoins`, the process will not be able to select them, throwing an \"Insufficient funds\" error.\r\n\r\nTo try it, you can just set the new flag `m_use_manual_selection` to true at line 609 of `rpc/spend.cpp`, which without something like https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin-core/commit/1291ba7d2463c062242b82df879fba8ca29ba627 will fail at line 140 of the `rpc_psbt.py` test (which is the test line that checks that coin locks are ignored for manually selected inputs).\r\n\r\nSo.. conclusion:\r\n\r\n I agree with you and have been working on it on a local branch. Unifying and cleaning most of these redundancies (thus why found #25005). And added the manual flag here in order to not add a bulk of changes that are required to keep the same current behavior (explained above) without entering into the rabbit hole.\r\n\r\nGetting deeper, some of the rabbit hole changes, linked to this work, that I have been working on locally (WIP) are:\r\n\r\n1) The `SelectCoins` process shouldn't be searching coins in the wallet. That is exactly what `AvailableCoins` is already doing --> It only needs to be focused on the coins selection algorithm.\r\n2) The wallet shouldn't be looping across the entire wallet's tx map if the user wants to select an specific set of inputs and nothing else --> it can just select them right away (skipping all the `AvailableCoins` checks using the manual selection flag).\r\n3) The locked coins skip/add can be customizable by the user at selection time.",

Those 3 RPCs all use the same `FundTransaction` function which currently does `fAllowOtherInputs = true`, so they always add the specified inputs regardless of state. The GUI only allows users to preset input that are shown in a list - a list which is created by doing `AvailableCoins` (with the addition of locked coins, but the GUI does not allow selecting locked coins). So those inputs already only consists of coins that are in a valid state, and hence any additional checks for those valid states are redundant. So `HasSelected + fAllowOtherInputs=false` is not materially useful and we could just unify both parameters to what `m_add_inputs=false` does (with the optimization to skip running the selection algos) and users would not observe any difference.",
