   "body" : "Seeking to make the `CoinControl` options less confusing/redundant.\r\nIt should have no functional changes.\r\n\r\nThe too long to read technical description; remove `m_add_inputs `, we can use the already existent `fAllowOtherInputs` flag.\r\n\r\n### Context:\r\n\r\nIn #16377 the `CoinControl` flag âm_add_inputsâ was added to tell the coin filtering and selection process two things:\r\n\t- Coin Filtering: Only use the provided inputs. Skip the Rest.\r\n\t- Coin Selection: Search the wtxs-outputs and append all the `CoinControl` selected outpoints to the selection result. Nothing else.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in `CoinControl` we already have a flag âfAllowOtherInputsâ which is already saying:\r\n\t- Coin Filtering: Only use the provided inputs. Skip the Rest.\r\n\t- Coin Selection: If false, no selection process -> append all the `CoinControl` selected outpoints to the selection result (while they are on the `AvailableCoins` filtered vector).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nAs can notice, the first point in the coin filtering process is duplicated in the two option flags. And the second one, is slightly different merely because it takes into account whether the coin is on the `AvailableCoins` vector or not.\r\nSo it makes sense to split the coin filtering behavior from the coin selection one: merging the âm_add_inputsâ and âfAllowOtherInputsâ into a single field for the coin filtering process while introducing another flag to keep the different behavior for the coin selection process.\r\n\r\nThe result is:\r\n\r\n1. \"fAllowOtherInputsâ: is in charge of telling the coin filtering process whether the user/wallet want to select other inputs outside the manually provided ones or not.\r\n\r\n2. âm_use_manual_selectionâ: is in charge of telling the coin selection process whether the user/wallet wants:\r\n    (A) no coin selection algorithm to be used -> Append all the provided inputs to the selection result. Or\r\n    (B) use the coin selection algorithm/s -> Select the best matching result out of the provided inputs and available coins.\r\n\r\nNote: so far, the âm_use_manual_selectionâ is only customized in âFundTransactionâ which sets it to false by default. In the future, this parameter can be another customizable option.\r\n\r\nââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ\r\n\r\nJust as an extra note:\r\nOn top of this, Iâm working on unifying/untangling further the coin filtering and selection processes so we have less duplicate functionality in both processes.",
