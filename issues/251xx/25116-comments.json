If people spot tests failures they should open issues. If other people see the same thing / can provide more info, they can comment on them. If eventually they can't be reproduced / disappear, the issue can be closed. Consolidating all of that into a single thread doesn't seem like it's going to improve things, other than be quite confusing / noisy.",
