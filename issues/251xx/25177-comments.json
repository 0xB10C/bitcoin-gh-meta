It is only one factor of many but I don't see consensus compatible forks as an irrelevance (especially in the light of motivations of Core subprojects like libbitcoinkernel).\r\n\r\nCorrect, `libbitcoinkernel` by design assumes to be reused as a library. But Bitcoin Core shouldn't care about code compatibility with any other bitcoin client. It just creates unneeded engineering burden in this repo. ",

This is noise. Hence for future conversations on broader issues that aren't specific to a PR I'd ask you to discuss it on IRC, open an issue etc rather than adding noise to the review of a PR with an uninformed Approach NACK. The review process doesn't work if we start getting billions of parrot NACKs and they somehow have to be factored into the merge decision.\r\n\r\nI have the understanding of things being discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25153 and do not agree with the way pull request was merged.
