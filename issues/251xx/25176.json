   "body" : "CLI -netinfo frequently returns \"error: JSON value is not a boolean as expected\" since the merge of #21160, which moved fRelayTxes (renamed to m_relay_txs in that pull) from CNodeStats to CNodeStateStats.\r\n\r\nThis change made getpeerinfo \"relaytxes\" an optional field that can return UniValue IsNull(). It is the only optional field used by -netinfo that didn't already handle that case.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24691.\r\n\r\nAlso rename the NetinfoRequestHandler::is_block_relay data member to is_tx_relay. The naming is out of date and incorrect, as lack of request of tx relay does not imply block relay, and a preference for tx relay doesn't imply that block relay isn't happening . Thanks to Marco Falke for noticing this.\r\n\r\n(I may look at reducing the number of optional node stats fields via refactoring at the net processing level, but ongoing refactoring there may make that slow or complicated and this is a one-line fix that works now.)",
