We have [removed support for system univalue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22646), and the API is already [marked as broken in our univalue repo](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue-subtree#library-usage):\r\n> This is a fork of univalue used by Bitcoin Core. It is not maintained for usage by other projects. Notably, the API is broken in non-backward-compatible ways.\r\n\r\nI think we are at the point where we could remove the univalue \"subtree\" entirely, as having to go through the current cycle of merging changes into our subtree, and then pulling them here, only makes refactoring / cleanups more complicated, and results in us having to carry a stack of additional files we don't actually need in this repository.\r\n\r\n> and seems to have no upsides.\r\n\r\nThere are upsides. They are outlined in the PR description, and two other linked PRs.\r\n\r\n> It would appear to serve no purpose other than to try to make more work for others.\r\n\r\nIf by more work, you mean, it might make it more difficult for you to maintain Knots, which maintains build options and code that we have removed, then yes, that's possible. However Bitcoin Core isn't making engineering/maintainence decisions based on whether or not they are benficial for forks of this codebase.",
