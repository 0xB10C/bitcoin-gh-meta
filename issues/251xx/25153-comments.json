We have [removed support for system univalue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22646), and the API is already [marked as broken in our univalue repo](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/univalue-subtree#library-usage):\r\n> This is a fork of univalue used by Bitcoin Core.

Notably, the API is broken in non-backward-compatible ways.\r\n\r\nI think we are at the point where we could remove the univalue \"subtree\" entirely, as having to go through the current cycle of merging changes into our subtree, and then pulling them here, only makes refactoring / cleanups more complicated, and results in us having to carry a stack of additional files we don't actually need in this repository.\r\n\r\n> and seems to have no upsides.\r\n\r\nThere are upsides.

However Bitcoin Core isn't making engineering/maintainence decisions based on whether or not they are benficial for forks of this codebase.",

And the work they are doing is completely invaluable, so I think their opinions should carry a lot of weight in design decisions that affect it, as long as they are reasonable and don't cause serious problems.\r\n\r\nIf this change causes more work for you, could something else be done to alleviate it? It might help to know what the specific problem is.\r\n\r\nOn the code review process and dealing with NACKs, maybe there are some improvements that could be made there, but we should worry about not slowing things down too much and creating more work for maintainers.

It might help to know what the specific problem is.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, it breaks compatibility with the official UniValue. If there was a reason or benefit to doing so, I might agree with you that it's justifiable, but this doesn't - it's essentially just a rename that does nothing but break compatibility.\r\n\r\n>On the code review process and dealing with NACKs, maybe there are some improvements that could be made there, but we should worry about not slowing things down too much and creating more work for maintainers. \r\n\r\nBitcoin Core claims to be a decentralised project, not run on the whims of maintainers. If fanquake wants his own personal derivative where he calls the shots single-handedly, he is welcome to have one.\r\n\r\nP.S. Note this isn't *just* Knots affected (though the anti-derivative mindset itself is a serious problem); reasonable people packaging Bitcoin Core (not just myself) reasonably wish to use shared libraries.",
