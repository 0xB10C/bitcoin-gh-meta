If someone knows how to reproduce the fixed failure behaviour on a Linux/BSD system, would be nice to know.\r\n\r\nAgree, it would be nice to be sure :) My assumption is that the Windows build is just slower than everything else and that's why we have only seen it there so far. Looking at https://cirrus-ci.com/github/bitcoin/bitcoin it always seems the be the job that takes the longest time.",
