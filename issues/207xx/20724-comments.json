That function takes a required  `message` argument which gets logged to the `NET` category. That'd fix all instances of net_processing not logging disconnections, and ensure that none are introduced in future.\r\n\r\nThe branch is here: https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/commits/2020-12-log-disconnect. It doesn't necessarily need to go in at the same time as this, but it might make sense to try to fix this definitively.",
