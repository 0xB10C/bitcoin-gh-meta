Pointers to the file system can be considered implementation details subject to change.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, the format of the block files *specifically* hasn't ever significantly changed, and is (I think) unlikely to change. \r\n\r\nTo be clear I definitely see when this can be useful. For example the size of our own `contrib/linearize` tool could be cut in half by using this.\r\n",
