The Bitcoin P2P protocol is stateful and in\r\ngeneral cannot handle messages being dropped. Dropped\r\nversion/verack/ping/pong messages will cause the connection to time out\r\nand be torn down. Other dropped messages may also cause the peer to\r\nbelieve that the peer has stalled and tear down the connection.\r\n\r\nIt seems difficult to uncover any actual issues with -dropmessagestest,\r\nand any coverage that could be generated would probably be easier to\r\ntrigger with fuzz testing.",
