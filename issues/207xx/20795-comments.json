Surprised that nobody replied anything yet here.\r\n\r\n> And, now that I am thinking of this, isn't there the expectation that if my initial transaction was done using Coin Control, and then if my fee bump (RBF) needs another UTXO input to cover the increase in fee, that Coin Selection for that will occur (regardless of whether or not the change address was a Custom Change Address)?\r\n\r\nAtleast user should be given warning if inputs are being changed. Let me share the details of my test transaction below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/104236072-f00c9880-547b-11eb-945f-a433fab1ded8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial tx with RBF enabled, selected one input from wallet, a custom change address (new address from same wallet):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/104235649-4a592980-547b-11eb-8be7-9df32955a909.png)\r\n\r\nReplacement transaction: https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/ae3975a21c646c1c74c228e388672f652883f4d312cc7a437b9180cc1390515b\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/104235750-69f05200-547b-11eb-9893-061990e3ef14.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
