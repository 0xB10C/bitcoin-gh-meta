      "body" : "@sipa Thanks for taking a look!\r\n\r\n> If I understand it correctly, the BIP idea doesn't concern itself with this being outbound->inbound or not, but the implementation only ever announces it in the outbound direction, and will disconnect if it's received from a (full) outbound peer. Is that worth pointing out (e.g. \"Peers MAY decide to not serve peers that announce this flag\").\r\n\r\nYes good observation.  When I was working on this, I realized that there was no protocol need to restrict this as being a message from inbound->outbound peer, so while I didn't have an immediate use case for outbound peers sending this message to inbound ones, I also thought there seemed to be little downside to permitting it in the future.\r\n\r\nThe only case where I thought it could be problematic is if we connect out to a peer that we expect to be a full-relay peer, and it turns out the peer tells us we won't get any transactions from them -- in this case I think we ought to disconnect.  (Arguably it's a bug that today we don't do this when we get fRelay=false from such a peer in their version message.)\r\n\r\nI'll update the BIP to reflect that peers should feel free to use this information in deciding who to stay connected to.\r\n\r\n> Should interaction with tx-relay specific other messages like mempool, filterload, filteradd, filterclear, feefilter be specified (e.g. these messages are disabled/forbidden/ignored on block only connections)?\r\n\r\nYes, I should both specify that those messages are not permitted, and I think disconnect peers who send them to us after negotiating BLOCKRELAY. I think this will require an extra piece of state for outbound peers who might send us a BLOCKRELAY message, but that seems no big deal.\r\n \r\n> Maybe it's worth pointing out that blocktxn/getblocktxn still function?\r\n\r\nI'll update the BIP to explicitly reflect this as well.\r\n",

It's a 20 line change, and doesn't seem too complex.\r\n\r\nThe downside to an approach like this (for both `m_addr_known` and `m_tx_relay`) is that we don't get the benefit of limiting and bounding the resources that will be used on the peer at the time of connection.  Adding a p2p message that is sent at the start of a connection (such as the one proposed here) allows us to do that.  Once we have a way to bound the resources of a peer that is connecting to us with this intent, I plan to propose that we increase the number of inbound connection slots that we can service, and reserve some of those for BLOCKRELAY peers.  From there, I think we could then start to increase the number of outbound block-relay-only connections we make without concern that we are taking over too many inbound connection slots on the network or using up too many node resources.\r\n\r\nFor some additional context, please see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-480400958 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19858#issuecomment-688918364.

      "body" : "I wondered whether the better approach would be to add a new bool to indicate whether tx-relay is disabled (like we have for compact blocks, or sendheaders, etc), or to update the connection type like I've done here. \r\n\r\nMy hesitation to add a new bool was that it seemed counter to the recent work to refactor `net` to use connection types as an alternative to the bucket-of-bool's approach for deciding how to interact with a peer.  If we have a set of semantics that we understand go together for a given peer, it's nice for code readability to encode that as simply as possible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my intention with the BIP was to allow future flexibility for what semantics might be possible (eg my intention is to allow for addr-relay to happen in the future if we add an explicit way to negotiate addr relay, as an example), so from that perspective, having a connection type perhaps implies too much of an understanding of what the peer may be doing.  And for inbound peers in particular, we never really know what they're doing, so perhaps having more than just \"inbound\" as a connection type may be misleading to future code readers as well.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of moving initialization of `m_tx_relay` to VERACK, but not sure if I'll end up tackling that here or deferring for the current refactoring work in progress to make more headway (I think we need to add a lock that guards access to the `m_tx_relay` pointer itself?)",

Given the limits overlap a little (extra outbounds vs feelers), and what to do when you have extra peers requires looking at other data anyway, I'm not sure that's very convincing though.\r\n\r\nHmm, how much we \"trust\" a connection might change over the course of a connection in future if we allow random inbound peers to authenticate themselves to us... So I guess that leaves me thinking that we should have `const m_conn_type` representing our purpose in having the connection? (Different purposes meaning substantial changes in the protocol state machine -- eg, blocks only we deliberately opt out of tx and addr relay even if we otherwise support both, feelers we disconnect after verack, addrfetch we disconnect after getting addresses, inbounds we have different delays for and send VERSION later)\r\n\r\n> (I think we need to add a lock that guards access to the m_tx_relay pointer itself?)\r\n\r\nMaybe?

      "body" : "Thanks all for the comments so far.  I've renamed the p2p message to \"disabletx\" to more clearly communicate what the effect of processing this message is.  Current draft is here: https://github.com/sdaftuar/bips/blob/2020-09-negotiate-block-relay/bip-disable-tx.mediawiki\r\n\r\nSome highlights, besides the message being renamed:\r\n * I've made it more explicit that the BIP37-related messages are disallowed\r\n * I've clarified that addr messages should be avoided for now, but could be sent/received if in the future we deploy a way to negotiate addr relay explicitly.  This accommodates existing software behavior without preventing us from cleanly separating these two ideas in the future.\r\n\r\nI don't think it makes sense to add a \"sendblocks\" p2p message, because there is no use case I'm aware of for connections on the p2p network to not want blocks (really, headers or block hashes, because unrequested blocks are themselves not widely supported on the network).  If there were such a use case, someone should feel free to propose this.  For now, I think it's sufficient for this use case -- of negotiating block-relay-only connections -- to disable transaction relay, and listening nodes can use the disabling of transaction relay as proposed here as a proxy for \"block-relay-only\" connections, to facilitate increased connection limits in the future.\r\n\r\nI do think that adding a way to opt-in to addr relay is desirable, however I think more research is required to figure out what that should look like.  Naively, I'd think it makes sense to opt-in to addr-relay on a per-network-type basis (as described in BIP 155), but how exactly that should work is intertwined with what relay strategies might make sense, and I would not feel comfortable proposing anything at this time (for instance, I'd say that we should clarify what the goals of address relay are, analyze what kinds of relay strategies optimize for that goal along with any DoS tradeoffs that might be introduced, and then determine what our own implementation might look like, before we finalize a specification).  If someone wants to work on such a proposal, I would encourage it.  However the current BIP was drafted with the goal of being compatible with any future work in this area so I don't think this should be a blocker.\r\n\r\nI'll wait a bit for more comments here, but my plan is to share this with the bitcoin-dev list soon and then return to the implementation questions that have come up so far.",

Just wanted to answer this:\r\n \r\n> * #19670 introduced a workaround to deduce inbound block-relay-only peers and protect them from eviction. After this PR, do you think we could revisit to make it more direct?\r\n\r\nI think we would wait until this has been deployed for a while and then (potentially) change the eviction logic.  Two things occur to me on this point:\r\n- Older software will continue to use the old way of (not) communicating their intentions, via the fRelayTxes flag. So to accommodate older software we may not want to switch to keying off this p2p message for a little while at least.\r\n- It seems most of the feedback has been to shy away from encoding overly broad semantics into a single p2p message; while I think that is fine it also means that from our peer's point of view, they will have to infer the connection \"type\" from the properties of the peer, rather than from the peer declaring its full intentions in a single message.  I think for now we can treat \"will never relay txes\" as essentially synonymous with these block-relay connections, but perhaps in the future there will be some distinction, and all a peer can do is rely on some set of flags that it might use to preference some peers over others -- which might put us exactly back to where we are today, with us just keying off of whether fRelayTxes is false, anyway.\r\n",

The goal of the this BIP process is to standardize/formalize these block-relay-only connections in a useful way -- in my view, this behavior has been a good thing to introduce and we want to make more of these connections and so it is worth standardizing.  \r\n\r\nSo I think the question is what is the best way to include this in the protocol.  I think there are some good reasons to make this narrowly tailored to the exact thing we need -- disabling of transaction relay -- but we should be mindful that comes with some cost to how these connections can be understood by the recipient (now and going forward as the p2p protocol evolves), and therefore code complexity in the implementation.  At any rate, I think I'm happy with the latest draft that spells out clearly that transaction relay must be disabled, and address relay is discouraged in the absence of any explicit negotiation for it (leaving the door open for a future addr relay protocol to govern addr behavior).\r\n\r\n> What is the purpose of compactblocks without transaction-relay traffic?\r\n\r\n@luke-jr You asked this question back when block-relay-only connections were introduced (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-484634796), and I answered this question back then as well (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759#issuecomment-484666402).  Nodes using these connections are welcome to also have full-relay connections to other peers, and therefore we might expect compact block relay to work just fine over block-relay-only links.  I would recommend looking at the logs of your own node(s) to see how well compact block relay works on the existing block-relay-only peers that we have; in my experience it works quite well with some block-relay-only peers being selected as HB peers (and vice versa).\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the BIP, software would be free to implement this proposal and not BIP 152, and just rely on `getdata` messages to request blocks.  Acceptance of this proposed BIP does not require acceptance/implementation of BIP 152.\r\n\r\n> > In the future, we can also save a bit of memory by not allocating (or deallocating) the peer data structures we maintain for transaction and address relay.\r\n> Can't we do that today, just by not allocating it until we know the peer wants it?\r\n\r\nAs I mention above, the goal is to be able to bound a peer's resource utilization at the time the connection is completed.  It would be unfortunate if a peer enabled tx relay later in a connection's lifetime and suddenly got disconnected just because we attempted to move it from one accounting bucket to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think for now we can treat \"will never relay txes\" as essentially synonymous with these block-relay connections, but perhaps in the future there will be some distinction, and all a peer can do is rely on some set of flags that it might use to preference some peers over others -- which might put us exactly back to where we are today, with us just keying off of whether fRelayTxes is false, anyway.\r\n\r\nAs an update, I added the user-facing connection type implementation in the GUI and CLI -netinfo, and we currently have to do the inferring @sdaftuar describes in order to distinguish between inbound full and block relay connections rather than being able to depend on `m_conn_type` alone. It's a minor point, but from that perspective, having standard `{inbound, outbound}-{full, block}-relay` types, including `INBOUND_BLOCK_RELAY`, might be useful.\r\n\r\nEdit: I see this proposal is now smaller and has been changed; will review.

See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1052/files#r575130294 which raises the same question in the bip.
