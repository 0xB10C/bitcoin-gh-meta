   "body" : "We've accumulated a collection of different ways of referring to outbound full relay and outbound block relay connection types in the codebase. In places, it is becoming less immediately clear which type of connection is referred to. The inbound block relay proposal in #20726 further highlights the need to disambiguate the naming and suggests a possible direction to take for more explicit, standard terms, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{inbound, outbound}-{full, block}-relay\r\n```\r\nFollowing up on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20726#issuecomment-748578410, this PR proposes that standardization for the outbound two with a scripted diff. The inbound two can be done in #20726 or after.\r\n\r\n",
