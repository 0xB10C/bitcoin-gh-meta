   "body" : "UPDATED:\r\nThis is an attempt to get a first commit for moving policy-related code together as proposed in #4943.\r\nThe main purpose of this PR is therefore discuss the commit \"Policy: Create CPolicy interface and CStandardPolicy class implementing it\" (currently https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/cf97f68c1b6f84a7ebab229415ce2befe5bd24b1) which may change with suggestions.\r\nThe commit \"Policy: MOVEONLY: script/standard.o::IsStandard() -> CPolicy::ValidateScript()\" (https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/0f0ec84e63c9dd28146930644e9c4631eee441fa) acts as an example for adding a method to CPolicy. \r\nThe commit \"Policy: Refactor: Move datacarrier policy logic to policy.o\" (https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/4d417d42e54eb8b3cce0fbd73144b42f7f58320d) is an example of adding an attribute to CStandardPolicy without exposing it on CPolicy or exposing CStandardPolicy itself.\r\nIn https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/ae5b16dfba42194d407f60fa747ea5df8e611fd2 the initialization of minRelayFee is moved but it's not made an attribute because it is still accesses from outside policy.\r\nAn example of a crazy custom policy that a user could implement for its local node can be found in https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/compare/policy_example\r\n\r\nThe commit \"Policy: Refactor: Move datacarrier policy logic to policy.o\" may be considered too risky and may be left for later to avoid delaying the first step. \r\nMaybe https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/22d35cf403567fc15b6d167751f1c11844a9625a is not welcomed. It is only necessary if you want to make InitPolicyFromArgs() and CPolicy::InitFromArgs() param mapArgs const and don't want to duplicate code.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry for letting the ut acks rot.",
