But it is a bit different on OS X. You don't need any compiler/linker flags because all system libs contain threads support. See https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/pthread.3.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/3/pthread for more details - especially the section INSTALLATION: *\"The default system libraries include pthread functions.  No additional libraries or CFLAGS are necessary to use these interfaces.\"*\r\n\"Silent compilation as single thread\" is thus not possible on OS X and this PR is Darwin/OS X only anyway.\r\n",

But upon closer inspection, it doesn't even try to compile without linking! It just assumes you'll forward CFLAGS to the linker, which explains why I had it setup that way to begin with.\r\n\r\nAfter trying a few things and checking deep in some docs, I now agree with @jgarzik. Your original suggestion was probably the correct thing to do, but it's just not worth doing for us. I'd rather leave a harmless warning around than risk trouble in the future.",
