You also moved main::IsStandardTx() and main::AreInputsStandard() in the more advanced policy branch you showed me (luke-jr/nodepolicy2).\r\nThe difference is that I'm also moving some constants/globals they use to policy.o at the same time and that I'm moving things to InitPolicyFromCommandLine() from init.cpp.\r\nWell, and that I'm moving these two functions before creating the class, while you create 4 new functions/methods when you create the class.\r\nOur main disagreements seem to be in the way we access the class and the abstract class/interface, as well as on policy.o depending on main.o.\r\nBut since this PR is about an uncontroversial start on policy.o, I think I could extend this PR with those movements and it will still make #5114, #5180, a rebased version of #5071 and any other policy-related PR easier to review.\r\nWhat do you think, should I bring more commits from #5180 here?
