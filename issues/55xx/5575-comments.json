The labels feature is useful, and aiming to expose it *eventually* in both RPC and the GUI would make things symmetrical, which is what many users expect.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand doing that without confusing current users of accounts even more will be difficult. Hence I like first communicating a complete deprecation of the account system as in this pull.\r\n\r\nThen introduce a *new* API for labels. This also makes it clear that the label system is separately useful and not just 'degraded accounts'. The usual warning apply - \"don't use this at the same time as the account system, or it will get confused\".\r\n",
