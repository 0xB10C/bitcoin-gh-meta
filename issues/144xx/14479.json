(Even if GCC allows it as non-standard language extension.)\r\n\r\nWe should not rely on undefined behaviour.\r\n\r\nInvoking undefined behaviour used to mean that we allow the the compiler to do anything it chooses, even \"to make demons fly out of your nose\". I think it should be clarified that those nasal demons not only fly out of your nose Ã¢ÂÂ they also intend to extract all privkeys you have in memory and upload them to a server in a foreign land (foreign in relation to you that is). We don't want that to happen.",
