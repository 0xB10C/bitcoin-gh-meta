   "body" : "With the new HD wallet code, importing wallets by xpub is now a possibility.\r\n\r\nThis would facilitate the creation of watch-only wallets. The current process, as I understand it, includes:\r\n- Create a new `wallet.dat` (with `createwallet` or on first-run)\r\n- Use `dumpwallet` to create a file with the `extended private masterkey`\r\n- Delete the wallet\r\n- Recreate the wallet from its xprv with `createwallet \"name\" true`, so it is watch-only\r\n\r\nThis doesn't consider the use case where an offline external client generates the `xprv` and `xpub`\r\n\r\nWe should be allowed to import an xpub:\r\n- At the root\r\n- At a given derivation path\r\n\r\n",
