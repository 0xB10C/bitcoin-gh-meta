Perhaps someone needs to look at the generated code, but the very similar constructions on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.17.0/src/crypto/common.h#L17L54 compile to essentially no-ops.  \r\n\r\nAs far as UB goes, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/union claims \"The details of that allocation are implementation-defined, and it's undefined behavior to read from the member of the union that wasn't most recently written. Many compilers implement, as a non-standard language extension, the ability to read inactive members of a union.\", which I believe to be true for gcc and clang. \r\n\r\nFinally, indeed it's weird that we rely on the exact memory representation of floating point numbers for serialization. However, it seems that the only place it's used (outside of tests) is for the `TxConfirmStats::decay` field, when saving/loading fee estimates to/from disk. That doesn't seem too hard to first convert to an integer or so as an independent change.",

The overall effect of that is that on BE systems, floats and doubles are byteswapped when reading/writing, which makes it incompatible across systems.\n\nThe code you suggest would not work, as it'd cast the floating point numbers semantically to integers (rounding them) rather than reinterpreting.",
