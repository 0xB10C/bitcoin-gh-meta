Note that we at the end say \"with tests\" despite using the enable feature. I'm fairly convinced this is a special case worth considering, despite GNU docs.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, we are currently using 'with(out)-gui' despite it being an internal feature. It may be a part of why I keep mixing these up, actually.\r\n\r\nI'm fine with dropping the without part, but I am hopeful I can not have to run configure twice all the time as I keep writing 'disable-test' to match up e.g. 'disable-bench'.\r\n\r\n> The other alias I'm -0, don't think build scripts should offer ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing ambiguous about accepting two versions for the same configuration option.",
