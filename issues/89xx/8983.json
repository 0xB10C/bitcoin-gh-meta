   "body" : "Displays block height and size in debug.log when a block is received.\r\n\r\nVarious people have expressed a desire for this to be logged in previous PRs.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the way I've passed the blocksize to ProcessNewBlock is the most ideal way. Very open to feedback on better ways.\r\n\r\nTested with \"make check\" now that I know about this! (Still not quite sure how to debug when tests fail quite yet though!)\r\n\r\nThe LogPrint also puts the debug message to \"block\" rather than \"net\" as part of an attempt to separate net debugs into more specific debugs. This pull does not include an update to init.cpp yet as I suspect this will want to be done as part of a later pull, once more things are using \"block\"? Apologies that I am unsure of the order in which this would be migrated. ",
