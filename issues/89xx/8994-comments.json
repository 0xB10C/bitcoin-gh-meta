Any suggestion to advance in that front in this PR instead of  #9177 (which currently doesn't work and has one unittest that is not independent) would be welcomed.\r\n\r\nYou have recently made improvements in the rpc test framework, @MarcoFalke , and are familiar with it. If you get bored and can help fix one of the 3 tests that aren't passing for custom or just comment about the python changes in general, that would be great.\r\n\r\nREM:\r\n- The last 2 commits are not necessary, but anyone feel free to comment on them.\r\n- Except for p2p-compactblocks.py, segwit.py (and now p2p-segwit.py too) all rpc tests pass with \"custom\" too",

Every time a field is added or removed all calls would need to be adapted. Note that ideally, in the future, all tests would rely on CreateChainParams but none of them on the chainparams globals (accessed to via SelectParams and Params() ).\r\n\r\nAnother simpler option would be to simply let chainparams.cpp depend on globals mapArgs and mapMultiArgs (it depends on util.o anyway).\r\n\r\nYet another option is to undo some of that changes in #9243 if that gets merged first, which would be my personal preference.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has more options, I'm all ears.",

Trying to move the bip9params args from regular args to the custom chainparams config file what was what causing errors unless self.chain = \"regtest\" before in p2p-segwit.py and p2p-compactblocks.py.\r\n\r\nsegwit.py is still failing with self.chain = \"custom\".
