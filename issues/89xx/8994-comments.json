Any suggestion to advance in that front in this PR instead of  #9177 (which currently doesn't work and has one unittest that is not independent) would be welcomed.\r\n\r\nYou have recently made improvements in the rpc test framework, @MarcoFalke , and are familiar with it. If you get bored and can help fix one of the 3 tests that aren't passing for custom or just comment about the python changes in general, that would be great.\r\n\r\nREM:\r\n- The last 2 commits are not necessary, but anyone feel free to comment on them.\r\n- Except for p2p-compactblocks.py, segwit.py (and now p2p-segwit.py too) all rpc tests pass with \"custom\" too",
