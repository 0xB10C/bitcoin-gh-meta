What about keeping both (the old \"testnet\" and the new \"chain\") for a while and mark the \"testnet\" one as deprecated in the help texts? Then remove \"testnet\" in 0.15",

IIRC we mentioned in the release notes at the time that testnet would be eventually removed in favor of chain. Maybe @Diapolo (who coded #4326)  remembers better?\r\nAt least for rpcmining::getmininginfo I think we're safe taking it out for 0.14. rpcmic::getinfo hasn't died yet, but since @laanwj said that was the plan, I don't think that should be a blocker.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
