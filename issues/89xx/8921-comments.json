IIRC we mentioned in the release notes at the time that testnet would be eventually removed in favor of chain. Maybe @Diapolo (who coded #4326)  remembers better?\r\nAt least for rpcmining::getmininginfo I think we're safe taking it out for 0.14. rpcmic::getinfo hasn't died yet, but since @laanwj said that was the plan, I don't think that should be a blocker.\r\n \r\nEDIT: Updated release notes.\r\n",
