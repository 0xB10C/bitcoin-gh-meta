      "body" : "Thanks for raising the issue but the problem is more general and not just limited to `-minrelaytxfee`.\r\nWe don't even have smoke tests for every rpc, let alone command line args.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in writing a python test for transaction relay policy, make sure it is easy to adjust in case priority gets removed. Moreover, note that there is also a transaction pool min fee, which adjusts when you hit the memory limit in the transaction pool. So for a transaction to be relayed by your node, it must satisfy (priority relay OR minrelaytxfee) AND (transaction pool min fee). ",
