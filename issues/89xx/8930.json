   "body" : "Based on #8928 because its the only way I can run tests.\nThis will conflict a bit with #8865, but that's easy to resolve, and I'd rather get some eyeballs on this sooner rather than later, so am leaving it freestanding. Once #8865 goes in the orphan processing will go into the CValidationInterface which manges \"net processing\" stuff.\n\nThis further decouples \"main\" and \"net\" processing logic by moving\norphan processing out of the chain-connecting cs_main lock and\ninto its own cs_main lock, beside all of the other chain callbacks.\n\nOnce further decoupling of net and main processing logic occurs,\norphan handing should move to its own lock, out of cs_main.\n\nNote that this will introduce a race if there are any cases where\nwe assume the orphan map to be consistent with the current chain\ntip, however I am confident there is no such case (ATMP will fail\nwithout DoS score in all such cases).\n",
