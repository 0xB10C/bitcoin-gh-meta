And for some other files (like wallet.dat or some parts of the utxo set) errors are not recoverable or at least not detectable without additional checksums/error correction.\r\n\r\nIf you want your wallet.dat to stay intact and run Bitcoin Core without consensus failures, I recommend using appropriate hardware.",
