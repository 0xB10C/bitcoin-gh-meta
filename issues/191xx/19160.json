The `LocalInit::spawnProcess` and `IpcProcess::serve` methods added here are entry points for spawning a child process and serving a parent process, and being able to make bidirectional, multithreaded method calls between the processes. A simple example of this is implemented in commit \"Add echoipc RPC method and test.\"\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR aside from the echo test were originally part of #10102, but have been split and moved here for easier review, and so they can be used for other applications like external plugins.\r\n\r\n[*] Note: the `--enable-multiprocess` feature is still experimental, and not enabled by default, and not yet supported on windows. More information can be found in [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md)\r\n",
