I mentioned why I think the name change is better: because the current name is very confusing. I think most people do not understand 'clean' to be what it is supposed to mean here. I am trying to use a name that is easy to understand and appropriate for the abstraction layer and I think setup is a neutral term that does not imply mining or loading from cache.\r\n\r\nFeel free to open an additional PR for more docs updates or give me a hint where you think I could extend this here and I will add it.",

The naming itself is misleading. So you would like it to be clearly misleading rather than not so clearly non-misleading? Anyway, I think @MarcoFalke 's suggested renaming would solve this. \r\n\r\n> * Objective: The change has consequences that are strictly worse. Changing all these files is noise and churn, messing with git history and erasing all usability of git blame for these settings across the functional test suite. These aren't copyright headers but test settings that are important enough that the convention has been to include them explicitly in almost every file. The only wise reason to change these lines is to change the setting.\r\n\r\nIf we would follow this rule blindly we would never do any refactorings. However, we do them sometimes if there is an added benefit. The benefit here is clarity of what this setting is doing. There is no doubt it's confusing as I have laid out before. And in this case, it is also less critical because this line never stands on its own. It is setup code that enables other stuff to work but is never a standalone thing that is relevant without the other code it makes work. The other will be the lines that developers will want to `git blame`, not the setup code. At least that is my impression of the code I have seen in the files I am changing.
