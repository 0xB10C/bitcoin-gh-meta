   "body" : "Inspired by #15206 and #15197, this PR moves all message header verification from the message processing layer and into the network/transport layer.\r\n\r\nIn the previous PRs there is a change in behavior, where we would disconnect from peers upon a single failed checksum check.  In various discussions there was concern over whether this was the right choice, and some expressed a desire to see how this would look if it was made to be a pure refactor.\r\n\r\nFor more context, see https://bitcoincore.reviews/15206.html#l-81.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the separation between the p2p layers, helping improvements like [BIP324](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18242) and #18989.",
