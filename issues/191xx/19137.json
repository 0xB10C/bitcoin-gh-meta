   "body" : "Adds two commands to the `bitcoin-wallet` tool: `dump` and `createfromdump`. These commands will be useful for a wallet storage migration in the future. It is also generally useful to have a storage agnostic dump like this. These commands are similar to BDB's `db_dump` and `db_load` tools. This can also be useful for manual construction of a wallet file for tests.\r\n\r\n`dump` outputs every key-value pair from the wallet as comma separated hex. Each key-value pair is on its own line with the key and value in hex separated by a comma. This can be output to stdout or to a specified file\r\n\r\n`createfromdump` takes a file produced by `dump` and creates a new wallet file with exactly the records specified in that file.\r\n\r\nA new option `-dumpfile` is added to the wallet tool. When used with `dump`, the records will be written to the specified file. When used with `createfromdump`, the file is read and the key-value pairs constructed from it. `createfromdump` requires `-dumpfile`.\r\n\r\nA simple round-trip test is added to the `tool_wallet.py`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #18971 for the changes to `ReadAtCursor` that it does.",
