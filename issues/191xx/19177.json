   "body" : "This PR touches only the p2p_invalid_messages.py functional test module.  There are two main goals accomplished here.  First, it fixes the \"invalid message size\" test, which previously made a message that was invalid for multiple reasons.  Second, it refactors the file into a single consistent style.  This file appears to have originally had two authors, with different styles and some test duplication.\r\n\r\nIt should now be easier and quicker to understand this module, anticipating the upcoming [BIP324](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18242) and [AltNet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18989) changes.\r\n\r\nThis should probably go in ahead of #19107, but the two are not strictly related.",
