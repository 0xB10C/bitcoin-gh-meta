   "body" : "The semantics of `setup_clean_chain` are off in my opinion. If it is set to true, there is actually no real chain setup, we only start with the Genesis block. That is not what I would expect 'clean' to mean. The 200 blocks chain that we set up if it is set to false could also be called 'clean' since there are no transactions or reorgs.\r\n\r\nI think this is also the reason that other people have been confused. The documentation for `test_shell` is not correct and the default has been re-declared in several tests. This PR fixes the documentation and removes settings that don't change the default. Additionally I suggest renaming `setup_clean_chain` to `skip_chain_setup`.",
