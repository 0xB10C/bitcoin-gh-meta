If we're going to remove this call can was also drop the `CheckBlockHeader` call inside `CheckBlock` ? \r\n\r\nAs the comment in `CheckBlock` states, the call is mostly redundant with the call in `AcceptBlockHeader`. With this change, we only reach `CheckBlock` after calling `AcceptBlock`, which calls `AcceptBlockHeader`, which has called `CheckBlockHeader`.",
