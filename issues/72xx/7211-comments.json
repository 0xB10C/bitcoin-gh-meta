      "body" : "@laanwj As you can see from the graphs neither CPU nor network is continuously loaded. I would rather expect it to load data as fast as it can, and validate data as they get available.\r\n\r\nAlso, when the new piece of data starts to load, there's a significant drop in CPU load. So it seems that the download starts only when there is no not validated data left, and computation starts only when some quite big piece of data got downloaded. This sounds like it's implemented as synchronous algorithm.",
