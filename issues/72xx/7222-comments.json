      "body" : "Concept ACK\r\n\r\n> Which RPC calls should return this information?\r\n\r\nI think at least `listtransaction`, `gettransaction` (wallet functions) should also support this.\r\n\r\n> Would it be helpful to distinguish between a transaction signaling RBF itself [...], versus inheriting the signal from some unconfirmed parent?\r\n\r\nYes. This would be useful IMO.\r\n\r\n> The answer can only be definitive for transactions that are in the mempool; transactions that are not in the mempool might have unknown parents which could signal RBF and we wouldn't know it. Is it worth trying to answer this question for transactions not in the mempool, and if so, what information should be returned?\r\n\r\nI don't see a use-case for getting the RBF signal for confirmed transactions (maybe for potential reorgs risk calculations?). But I agree, without `-txindex`, parents RBF signal is probably unknown.",
