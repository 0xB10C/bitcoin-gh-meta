Adding the whole dependency chain might increase the problem.\r\nI think adding more and more features for spending or estimating risks for 0-confs is the wrong direction. Also the cost for such \"features\" needs to be paid by full node operators (we already have enough resource costs there).",

The filter is already auto-updated to catch transactions that spend previously matched outputs, so it doesn't need to be constantly re-loaded after each transaction. In any case the additional load will be negligible.\r\n\r\nImproving the usability 0-conf is certainly an important goal for increasing bitcoin adoption. It's unrealistic to expect people not to use 0-conf, and there are several improvement paths, such as broadcasting partial block solutions, that can make them reliable in more situations.",

In this case, merchants will *still* accept 0-conf and consider the fraud rate part of the cost of accepting bitcoin. (The cost of waiting for confirmation is even higher in many situations.) Our goal then is to lower that fraud rate as much as practical, even though getting to zero obviously isn't possible",
