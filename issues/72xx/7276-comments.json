We could move this special case to AcceptToMemoryPool as well.\r\nSomething like https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/dc0dab8b47b13771dd6bc7ecd08ead7b4e553bee (although that commit is based on previous commits so it wouldn't be exactly like that if done alone).\r\nMaybe we can fix this in that way (also helping libconsensus encapsulation by removing the STANDARD_NOT_MANDATORY_VERIFY_FLAGS [relay policy] dependency from CheckInputs() ).\r\n\r\nOr, as always, \"that can be done later\".\r\nOtherwise utACK, good catch.",
