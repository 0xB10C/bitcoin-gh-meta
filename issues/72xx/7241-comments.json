      "body" : "@laanwj Yeah, the intention here is that this would mainly for use by pools, the only other use case I can see this being good for would be for situations were a node's local policy is more restrictive due to some other config option than the the rest of the network, which seems to be the case here since the dust limit is tied to minrelaytxfee(I can see the logic in this but I think we should have a way to manually override it). I think the best way to do this would be to also have a flag to set the submitted transaction to maximum priority when being submitted through sendrawtransaction.",
