I don't think we should offer policies that don't make sense for a user to logically choose.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the motivation for someone turning off opt-in RBF in favor of a no-replacement policy?  If it's because they don't want to personally accept transactions that might be later replaced, then I think we should just make sure that bitcoind offers whatever tools a user would need to determine whether a transaction is opting-in, so the user can reject the payment if they choose.  Not accepting opt-in transactions at all seems much more useful to the user than locally choosing to not accept replacements of such transactions.  Breaking relay of opt-in RBF replacement transactions seems to offer no additional local benefits that I can see (at least, not any local benefits that can't be better achieved a different way), while it would provide some harm to part of the network (namely those users who might use it in the future).\r\n\r\nSo offering it as a policy might be confusing to people, since having the option implies there's a good reason some might want to turn it off, and I don't think there is such a reason.  (If there is currently a reason, say because bitcoind doesn't currently make it easy for users to know whether a transaction is opting-in, then I think we should make that easy instead, which is not difficult to implement.  If there are other reasons, I'd like to hear them.)\r\n\r\nI can understand the motivation for offering full-RBF, as it makes sense to me that some users might want that policy, but given the existence of opt-in RBF, is full-RBF likely to offer meaningfully different outcomes for what gets into your mempool?  I expect not, and I don't see the need for Bitcoin Core to support what has been a controversial policy that we expect would provide minimal actual benefit to users choosing to run it.",

To @sdaftuar's point, they may want to be able to make txs non-replaceable, but that doesn't occur just by them changing their local policy.  I can't believe I'm suggesting this, but perhaps a more useful feature would be the ability to flag a single tx as non-replaceable, which might be something miners wanted to do if they want to mine a particular version of a spend.  Would require some changes to the RBF logic though..\r\n",
