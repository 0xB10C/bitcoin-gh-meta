Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis is my favourite type of contribution: it not only fixes current code but also fixes **future** code by introducing a mechanism that helps us avoid introducing new instances of the same class of issue. Exactly the type of contribution that I was referring to in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14217#issuecomment-423812131:\r\n\r\n> Personally I'm much more excited to see a PR submitted which strengthens the long term security of the project in some form compared to when I see a PR submitted which implements some shiny new feature :-)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above: `__slots__` is also an unambiguous improvement from a memory usage perspective.\r\n\r\nutACK 965c8ff9c7539719eb36bd46297358e33b571766",
