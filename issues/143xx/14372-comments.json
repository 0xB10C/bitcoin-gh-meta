We always use the local catalog to do the build, so they can just be directly replaced before calling `vcpkg remove --outdated; vcpkg install`.\r\n\r\nNote: If you want them to be removed by `remove --outdated`, you need to make sure to change the version in `ports\\leveldb\\CONTROL` when making modifications.",
