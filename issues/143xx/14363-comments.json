      "body" : "This is rather reaching. An astonishingly few amount of nodes are used for rpc purposes, and even fewer of those are going to be in a position where they can't easily upgrade. Their contribution to the amount of vulnerable nodes is negligible at best.\r\n\r\nA much directer way of supporting the goal of having users patch their nodes quickly would be to have had the patch back-ported for previous releases much faster.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do think core is a bit aggressive in how they deprecate stuff (and require using a deprecated flag) which makes upgrading a bit more painful than it should be.  And I have been bitten really badly by some instability before (namely changes in the edge-cases of ListSinceBlock which broke my application about 3 times) to the point I had to stop even using it.  However, I would argue a lot of that pain is caused by poor documentation  (some stuff literally has no documentation of what it should do so it's anyones guess what is correct behavior) and a lack of tests (to catch changes/regressions) and ultimately a lack of developers.\r\n\r\nI think increasing the maintenance burden by imposing a \"never break user space\" will just strictly make things worse.",
