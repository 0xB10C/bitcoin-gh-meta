It could be that @jimpo meant to give `seek` absolute seek (`SEEK_SET`) behaviour (alternative 2 in the PR description) and the `-6` (instead of `0`) in the test is just a typo. With that solution the switch to signed integer is not needed :-)\r\n\r\nI'll await some clarification on the intention here and adjust accordingly.",
