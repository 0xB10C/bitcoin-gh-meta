This fixes that and adds a test case for it.\r\n\r\nIt really only makes sense to check for the separator for the output maps as if an input or global map was missing a separator, the fields following it would be interpreted as belonging to the previous input or global map. However I have added the check for those two anyways to be consistent.",
