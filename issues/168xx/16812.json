This commit removes all existing whitespace errors from Core markdown files (skips `src/crypto/ctaes/`, `leveldb/`, and `doc/release-notes/`), `bitcoin.conf`, and `Info.plist.in`.\r\n\r\nFurther formatting could be done on the markdown documents, but seeing as there several coexisting styles that break a few `markdownlint` rules, a first step would be to define and add a linter to Travis. For now, the small fix is made.",
