The poisson delay maxes out at about 3 minutes, so any tx that's been around for <15m is either to new to relay, or is already in mapRelay.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would have some per-peer logic so that we only relay new txs to peer X if we've INV'ed the tx to peer X; but saving that work for a different PR in order to keep this one simple.",
