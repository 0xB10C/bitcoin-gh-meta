The poisson delay maxes out at about 3 minutes, so any tx that's been around for <15m is either to new to relay, or is already in mapRelay.\r\n\r\nIdeally we would have some per-peer logic so that we only relay new txs to peer X if we've INV'ed the tx to peer X; but saving that work for a different PR in order to keep this one simple.",

In `ProcessGetData()`, I believe we rate limit tx-getdata requests by (a) the contents of mapRelay (which should be bounded by our inv-timers), and (b) mempool requests are rate-limited by the poisson timers.  I guess also (c) we can respond to multiple tx-getdata requests in a single ProcessGetData() only up until the send buffer for the peer is full.  However, this logic for responding to getdata requests directly from the mempool bypasses measures (a) and (b) -- should we add some additional rate limiter here?~~ \r\n\r\nEdit: on further thought, I think this concern is basically misplaced.  The mempool command is not rate-limited by poisson timers (just the initial response is delayed once), and at any rate there are trivial ways to use bandwidth that are not exacerbated by this change.",
