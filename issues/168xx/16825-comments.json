I agree its only a somewhat marginal benefit, but I wouldn't discount it completely (assuming my understanding of the likelyhood of finding Tor peers by default is correct, which may not be....).\r\n\r\nc) I agree Tor listening sockets may be limited, hopefully the bump to 150 helps. Anecdotally, my Tor-listening nodes don't appear to get any more connections over Tor than normal IP, in fact much, much less.",
