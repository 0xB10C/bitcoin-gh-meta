Nice idea!\r\n\r\nCan we think of any drawbacks beyond the small amount of additional bandwidth?\r\n\r\nWhat would be the pros/cons of keeping the connect-if-tip-is-stale logic unchanged and only adjust the feeler logic so that feelers sync headers?",

      "body" : "I would break this into two features:\r\n\r\n**Feature one: syncing block headers from feelers:**\r\nI don't see any drawbacks to this and it makes eclipse attacks more detectable when all your regular connections are eclipsed but your feeler connections are not since your feelers will tell you about blocks which no one else will.\r\n\r\n**Feature two: evicting stale connections and replacing them with feeler connections:**\r\nI can see the advantages of doing this, however I worry that an attacker with mining power will exploit this eviction strategy to slowly take over your outgoing connections by making your existing outgoing connections stale. I'm not sure how possible this attack is in practice as I'm not familiar with the precise definition of what makes something a stale tip.\r\n\r\nMaybe instead of evicting connections if you get a block header that none of your other peers know about download it from that feeler connection?\r\n",
