      "body" : "This is strictly looser than what we do right now, because it lines up with existing behavior in the case where setConflicts.size() == 1, and additionally would allow some replacements if > 1.  However, it's a bit more complicated to describe the circumstances under which the replacement would succeed: using the minimum of size_with_descendants of each directly conflicting transaction should work for respecting chain limits, but it's conservative and I imagine it could be difficult for a wallet author to try to determine under what circumstances they should conflict with additional small transactions versus restricting to just replacing a single large transaction.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I think you could end up in a situation where, in order to conflict with and replace two transactions, you would have to first relay additional transactions to pump up the size_with_descendants of one of them(!).  Imagine two mempool transactions A and B, where A has a large size_with_descendants and has a parent near its descendant size limit, while B is small and has no in-mempool parents.  Then the minimum size_with_descendants of A and B is small, so any attempt to replace the two transactions with a new one would fail (because the bump size will be too low to pass the descendant size limits associated with A's parents) -- unless B's size_with_descendants were increased first.  This is obviously counterintuitive (and wasteful), so I think we should stick with simpler behavior that is easier to explain to wallet authors...",
