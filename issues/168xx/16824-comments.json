I think the point @MarcoFalke is making is that the behaviour you are describing is by design.",

Crash dumps by design contain the entire address space, which might contain private keys. \r\n\r\nMaybe there is a flag that could be set to disable crash dumps by default for the program?\r\n\r\nAnyhow, there's a best-effort attempt to clear decrypted keys after use, if your wallet.dat is encrypted, see use of `memory_cleanse`. Even this can never be 100% effective as the application might crash at any time. If your wallet.dat is not encrypted, then parts of that file (including raw private keys) might be cached and are part of the memory and it's fully expected.",
