   "body" : "Closes #16872.\r\n\r\nPR #16866 renamed the `decode` argument in gettransaction to `verbose` to make it more consistent with other RPC calls like getrawtransaction. However, it inadvertently overloaded the \"details\" field when `verbose` is passed. The result is that the original \"details\" field is no longer returned correctly, which seems to be a breaking API change.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- takes the simplest path to restoring the \"details\" field by renaming the decoded one back to \"decoded\" while leaving the `verbose` argument for API consistency, which was the main intent of #16866,\r\n\r\n- addresses [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16185#discussion_r320740413) by mentioning in the RPC help that the new decoded field is equivalent to decoderawtransaction, and\r\n\r\n- updates the help, functional test, and release note.\r\n\r\nReviewers, to test this manually, build and run `bitcoin-cli help gettransaction` and `bitcoin-cli gettransaction <wallet txid> false true`, and verify that the command returns both `details` and `decoded` fields.\r\n",
