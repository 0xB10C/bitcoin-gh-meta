   "body" : "This change is mainly a naming / organization change intended to simplify #10102. It:\r\n\r\n- Renames struct InitInterfaces to struct Node and moves it from src/init.h to\r\n  src/node/node.h. This is a cosmetic change intended to make the point of the\r\n  struct more obvious.\r\n\r\n- Gets rid of BanMan and ConnMan globals making them Node struct members\r\n  instead. Setting rid of these globals has been talked about in past as a way\r\n  to implement testing and simulations. Making them Node members is a way of\r\n  keeping them accessible without the globals.\r\n\r\n- Splits g_rpc_interfaces global into g_rpc_node and g_rpc_chain globals. This\r\n  better separates node and wallet rpc methods. Node RPC methods should have\r\n  full access to Node state, while wallet RPC methods should only have indirect\r\n  access via Chain interface.\r\n\r\n- Adds Chain::addClient() method and replaces Node::chain_clients vector with a\r\n  linked list. This helps #10102 deal more gracefully with killed wallet\r\n  processes, and makes it possible for new wallet processes not started by the\r\n  node to connect and disconnect independently\r\n  (https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/conn-export).\r\n\r\n- Adds Node& reference to interfaces::Chain class and interfaces::MakeChain()\r\n  function. This is needed to access ConnMan and BanMan instances without the\r\n  globals.\r\n\r\n- Gets rid of redundant Node and Chain instances in Qt tests. This is\r\n  needed due to the previous MakeChain change, and also makes test setup a\r\n  little more straightforward. More cleanup could be done in the future, but it\r\n  will require deduplication of bitcoind, bitcoin-qt, and TestingSetup init\r\n  code.",
