This would happen naturally since the estimates use a exponentially decaying moving average and would happen quicker for estimates for shorter confirmation times.   It's possible it doesn't work quite like this, or this doesn't aggressively enough disable estimates, but I don't know without further investigation.  \r\n\r\nFor a non-lightning use case, the slightly stale estimates are still designed to be good enough to be usable for getting transactions confirmed and I think make more sense than having no estimates.  I'd never considered a design goal of trying to keep estimates in sync with peers. ",
