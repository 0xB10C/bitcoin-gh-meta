   "body" : "When using the `linearize-data.py` contrib script to export block data, there are edge cases where the script fails with an `Invalid magic: 00000000` error. This error occurs due to the presence of padding bytes that occasionally appears between consecutive blocks in the block data file.\r\n\r\nThere's an ongoing conversation about this in #14986. @sipa also admitted that it is a bug in #5028. Fortunately, this is not an issue in bitcoin core as it handles this type of situation gracefully and so no fix in bitcoin core is required. \r\n\r\nThis PR is an improvement on how the script handles these \"invalid magic bytes\". Rather than failing, this patch allows the script to search for the next occurrence of the magic bytes and then starts reading the block from there.",
