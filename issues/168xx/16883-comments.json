      "body" : "As a proof of concept and first time contribution this is pretty cool! Thanks for the PR. I built and ran on my macOS machine; it worked out of the box. \r\n\r\nWhilst I don't think this is something that we'd merge into this repository (for a number of reasons, although build system additions like #16110 are more welcome), it's definitely the kind of thing I'd like to see built on top of Bitcoin Core. As the [process separation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102) and other refactoring work continues, building alternative GUIs should become easier.\r\n\r\n> * verifying transactions only while in foreground or charging (to preserve battery)\r\n> * enabling phone to phone transactions (NFC or bluetooth for enhanced privacy)\r\n> * providing services to other local apps (think Lightning wallets, they could get the blockchain state from Core, no wasting of resources)\r\n\r\nThese are all interesting discussions to have, but would be best suited for the repository where this GUI code eventually lived. i.e We wouldn't want to end up having discussions about some Android NFC stack here. Although I assume you'd be leveraging Qt's built in support for either.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in other mobile development, there is also a [PR open](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/12557) to try and support building for iOS devices. If you have other related thoughts / questions, feel free to reach out to me directly.\r\n\r\n![startup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863730/65114841-d3905580-da19-11e9-9dcf-9a67be1339f7.png)\r\n\r\n![transactions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863730/65114854-d5f2af80-da19-11e9-88e1-707d25efcc5a.png)\r\n\r\n![good](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/863730/65114870-da1ecd00-da19-11e9-95bc-4adc6567b400.png)",
