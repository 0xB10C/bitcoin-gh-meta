We use it as a pure workflow and communication tools which can exchanged relatively painfree.\r\n\r\nSwitching away from GitHub just because of eventual expected friction makes little sense to me (as of today).\r\nAFAIK we'r still mirroring everything,... including the GitHub communication (comments, pulls, etc.). I also regularly fetch all pulls/issues html (which is nowadays incomplete with the lazy loading approach of comments and reviews).\r\n\r\nMaybe we should reinvestigate in mirroring \"everything\". Weekly fetching of all issues/pulls including all comments, etc. by the JSON API.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are viable GitHub alternatives (like GitLab) which probably makes it harder for Microsoft to add things like \"everyone needs a Microsoft account\". But sure, that could change.",
