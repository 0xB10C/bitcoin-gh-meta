For consistency the interface of `getblock` (verbosity 0, 1, 2) could be reused.\r\nMaybe `getblockfrompeer` could just be a flag of `getblock`.\r\n\r\nAlso, IMO `GetBlockChecked` should notify the user to use `getblockfrompeer` for block that are not on disk.\r\n\r\n**Check if the node is connected**\r\nChecking for connectivity could be done with `connman->GetNodeCount` as in [mining.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/rpc/mining.cpp#L666).\r\n\r\n**Mark the block as in flight**\r\nInstead of mark the block as in flight and persist the block, I would add 2 fields to the public interface of `CNode` the first to notify `ProcessMessage` that a block with a certain hash is  expected, the second to check (in a loop) for the requested block.\r\n\r\n",

That also allows inspection using the regular methods, `getblock`, `getchaintips` and `getrawtransaction` (e.g. to learn about a specific doublespend). Pruned nodes will toss it automatically after a while (IIUC).\r\n\r\nI also want to be able to fully validate the block. It's very time consuming, but it works: call `invalidateblock` on the main chain block for the same height, so reorgs to the block you just downloaded and verified it. Then call `reconsiderblock` to sync to the tip again.",
