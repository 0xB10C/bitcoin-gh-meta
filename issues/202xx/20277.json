This is likely a useless bandwidth waste for the following reasons :\r\n\r\n* We may not have the UTXO(s) from which they spend and thus they will be considered again as orphans\r\n* We may not have already seen the block in which they're already spent and thus will be useless when arrived at current network tip\r\n * Even if we assume the UTXO stays unspent at current network tip, we aren't uncertain about the accuracy of its feerate\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't resolve anymore orphans during IBD. This is aligning behavior with INV reception, where we discard them if IBD (L2690, in `src/net_processing.cpp`).\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't disable tx processing at NetMsgType::TX reception but maybe we should directly jump for this behavior by returning early even before message deserialization ?",
