This option is not enabled on any of our CI builds, and it's likely that no-one is running them at all.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sanity checks a (hidden) runtime option that can be enabled with `-checkaddrman`. It's enabled for our unit tests and by default on regtest. Additionally, a sanity check failure now asserts, rather than logging and continuing. This matches the behavior of CTxMemPool and TxRequestTracker, where a failed sanity check asserts.\r\n\r\nBuilds on #20228. ",
