This will remove from the `OutputGroup` any dust outputs. But if after the removal, the `OutputGroup`'s effective value is still positive, then it remains available for coin selection. So it is possible that BnB will select an `OutputGroup` but not the dust outputs associated with the same destination, so the avoid partial spends condition is violated.\r\n\r\nThis does have a privacy risk as the user may think that avoid partial spends is active, but then a partial spend occurs. If this risk is indeed a problem, then we could just remove any `OutputGroup` that contains dust outputs, regardless of the other outputs in that group. However this has a DoS attack risk. If an attacker sends dust outputs to existing addresses, then it is possible for that attacker to prevent someone who has enabled avoid partial spends from spending any of their coins because all `OutputGroup`s would be removed for containing dust.",
