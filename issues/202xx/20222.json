   "body" : "This PR cleans up the CTxMemPool interface by including the ratio used to determine when a mempool sanity check should run in the constructor of CTxMempool instead of using nCheckFrequency which required a cast from a double to a uint32_t. Since nCheckFrequency (now called m_check_ratio) is set in the constructor and only every read from there after, it can be turned into a const and no longer needs to be guarded by the 'cs' lock. \r\n\r\nSince nCheckFrequency/m_check_ratio no longer needs to lock the 'cs' mutux, mutex lock line in the \"CTxMempool::check\" function can be moved below where the m_check_ratio variable is checked. Since the variable is 0 by default (meaning that \"CTxMempool::check\" will most likely not run its logic) this saves us from unnecessarily grabbing the lock.",
