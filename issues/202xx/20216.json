   "body" : "Looking at our new SQLite database code, I noticed that there is a potential problem in the method `IsSQLiteFile()`:  If there is no terminating zero within the first 16 bytes of the file, the `magic` buffer would be over-read in the `std::string` constructor for `magic_str`. Fixed by using the \"from buffer\" variant of the string ctor (that also takes a size) rather than the \"from c-string\" variant (see http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/string/).\r\n\r\nThe behaviour can be reproduced by the following steps:\r\n* Creating a file of at least 512 bytes in size (to pass the minimum size check) that doesn't contain zero bytes in the magic area, e.g. simply:\r\n`$ python3 -c \"print('A'*512)\" > /tmp/corrupt_wallet`\r\n* Showing content and size of the `magic_str` string in case the magic check fails\r\n* Create a simple unit test that simply calls `IsSQLiteFile` with the corrupt wallet file\r\n* Run the unit test and see the random gibberish output of `magic_str` after 16 `A`s :-)\r\n\r\nOr, TLDR variant, just get the branch https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/tree/reproduce_sqlite_magic_overread, compile unit Tests and run the script `./reproduce_sqlite_magic_overread.sh`.\r\n\r\nNote that this is the minimal diff, probably it would be better to avoid `std::string` at all in this case and just use `memcmp`, strings that include null bytes are pretty confusing.\r\n\r\n",
