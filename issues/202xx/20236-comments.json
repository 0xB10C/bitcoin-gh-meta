      "body" : "Hello @itoffshore,\r\n\r\nthanks for your report!\r\nI tried to reproduce the behaviour you described via Docker and came up with the following `Dockerfile` after some researching about Alpine Linux and its package system:\r\n```\r\nFROM alpine:3.12.1\r\nRUN apk add alpine-sdk\r\nRUN adduser --disabled-password btc\r\nRUN addgroup btc abuild\r\nUSER btc\r\nWORKDIR /home/btc\r\nRUN git clone git://git.alpinelinux.org/aports\r\nWORKDIR /home/btc/aports/community/bitcoin\r\nRUN abuild-keygen -a\r\nENTRYPOINT abuild -r\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding and running this container via\r\n```\r\n$ docker build -t bitcoin_issue_20236 . && docker run -it bitcoin_issue_20236\r\n```\r\n\r\nbuilds the source and runs the tests, which all pass on my system, which is a x86_64 architecture with 4.4.0 kernel. So I unfortunately couldn't reproduce your reported behaviour. Can you give more details on your system? Did you do any other steps than described in the Dockerfile (which is of course very minimal)? Does it make a difference if `make check` is called manually or via the `abuild` tool?\r\nAlso it would be interesting on how it is possible to keep the source after building -- after `abuild -r` the `src` folder within `aports/community/bitcoin/` seems to be gone.\r\n",
