(And yes, I'm aware that initializer lists have higher priority in C++). As reader of the class interface I'd not assume an in-class initialization is overruled in the ctor. Also, without the in-class initialization the compiler has the chance to throw an error if the const member was forgot to be initialized in the ctor.",
