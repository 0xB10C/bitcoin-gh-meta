But it doesn't matter, it's a red herring in the first place: there is no a reason to serve them over DNS. A node behind Tor can't do the kind of DNS lookup that returns multiple results.\r\n\r\nDespite that, the DNS seeder 'network exploration' code could still collect them, in principle, for this purpose and for statistics.\r\n",
