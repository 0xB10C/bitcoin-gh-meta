   "body" : "Similarly to how #18698 added `ProcessNewBlock()` and `ProcessNewBlockHeaders()` methods to the `ChainstateManager` class, this PR adds a new `ProcessTransaction()` method. Code outside validation no longer calls `AcceptToMemoryPool()` directly, but calls through the higher-level `ProcessTransaction()` method. Advantages:\r\n\r\n- The interface is simplified. Calling code no longer needs to know about the active chainstate or mempool object, since `AcceptToMemoryPool()` can only ever be called for the active chainstate, and that chainstate knows which mempool it's using. We can also remove the `bypass_limits` argument, since that can only be used internally in validation.\r\n- responsibility for calling `CTxMemPool::check()` is removed from the callers, and run automatically by `ChainstateManager` every time `ProcessTransaction()` is called.",
