This was apparently fixed upstream by [this commit](https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/commit/78a9453496b6f9eeafd6c23b8df52268b2e647b7). Pulling in that change should fix that problem.\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up, we could split the feature detection from minisketch's configure.ac out into an m4 file that both minisketch and downstream projects include. That would prevent these types of out-of-sync issues.",
