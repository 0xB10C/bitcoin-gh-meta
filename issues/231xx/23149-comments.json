It's the general problem with Werror of course.\r\n\r\nI agree, and [argued somewhat against](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20544#pullrequestreview-545673510) a similar change to this in #20544 with similar reasoning, especially since there seemed to be misunderstanding around the fact that repeating warning flags for `-Werror=` usage was not \"duplication\". I'm also certainly not in the camp that thinks everything _must_ be built with `-Werror` at any cost, which is has led us down this path of a mash of hacks/pragmas/suppressions etc, across our source, build system and CI, just to try and kill every warning.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the same time, I think what we are currently doing is somewhat unclear. What warrants being added to `-Werror=` or not? There are environments where you could build master with `--enable-werror` right now, and it would fail (i.e macOS, as we can't seem to recreate `-Wsign-compare` warnings in the CI). This has been muddied even further with the use of `--enable-suppress-external-warnings`, as in most cases now you couldn't use `--enable-werror` without that anyways.\r\n\r\nI think the risk of disruption in the CI from newly introduced compiler warnings is low, not only due to us having plenty of lead time to fix them if they are legitimate, but also because I think the likelihood of Clang or GCC introducing some horrible new warning spew is also fairly low, given the number of projects that build with `-Werror` by default.",
