I've meant that it would be interesting to see if an optimization that uses EA to mutate & crossover is actually an improvement over just random draws. To make the comparison fair, the EA and random draws should do the same number of fitness evaluations. If the EA optimizes with 10000 evaluations to find the best individual, a fair comparison would be with an algorithm that simply randomly choose 10000 individuals to find the best. If EA performs consistently better, then this is a sign that the crossover & mutation actually is a benefit. If just randomly picking individuals perform better this is a sign that the crossover & mutation does not really work well to explore the fitness space. It could go both ways.",
