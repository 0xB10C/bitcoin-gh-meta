      "body" : "The same issue comes up in machine learning:  every path through a forest of decision trees looks alike, because the code's just a loop through a structure that's the real code.\r\n\r\nPeople have done various things on this I don't recall offhand, not sure any that are out there work way better than libFuzzer value profiles, unless custom targeted.\r\n\r\nOne idea I had but have never explored is to use some kind of annotation on key structures that, in a fuzz build, expands to explicit coverage targets somehow.  I suspect in C++ a modest annotation + evil template magic could do this.  My (very unsupported) guess is that -use_value_profiles=1 is not great at this because it has no way to know which state is noise and which is important.  I have an NSF proposal in (no clue if we'll get funded) that has adding support for this kind of thing to DeepState as a major component.\r\n\r\nWriting an #IF_FUZZ hand \"fake coverage\" that won't get optimized away for critical targets might be doable in some cases, like here?",
