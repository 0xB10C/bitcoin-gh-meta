   "body" : "With this change, we get more fine-grained error messages if something goes wrong in the course of communicating with the SQLite database. To pick some random examples, the error codes SQLITE_IOERR_NOMEM, SQLITE_IOERR_CORRUPTFS or SQLITE_IOERR_FSYNC are way more specific than just a plain SQLITE_IOERR, and the corresponding error messages generated by sqlite3_errstr() will hence give a better hint to the user (or also to the developers, if an error report is sent) what the cause for a failure is.\r\n\r\nSee the SQLite documentation\r\nhttps://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/extended_result_codes.html\r\nhttps://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/c_abort_rollback.html\r\n> In its default configuration, SQLite API routines return one of 30 integer result codes. However, experience has shown that many of these result codes are too coarse-grained. They do not provide as much information about problems as programmers might like. In an effort to address this, newer versions of SQLite (version 3.3.8 2006-10-09 and later) include support for additional result codes that provide more detailed information about errors.",
