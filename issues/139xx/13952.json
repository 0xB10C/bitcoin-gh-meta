This is an anonymity leak for users who aren't aware of the command-line or `bitcoin.conf` flags for proxy settings.\r\n\r\nWhat behavior did you expect?\r\n\r\nAs part of the \"Welcome\" dialog on initial launch (which currently lets the user choose the data directory), Bitcoin-Qt should ask the user whether they'd like to set proxy settings.\r\n\r\nWhat was the actual behavior (provide screenshots if the issue is GUI-related)?\r\n\r\nBitcoin-Qt doesn't prompt the user to set proxy settings before it starts connecting to the P2P network.\r\n\r\nHow reliably can you reproduce the issue, what are the steps to do so?\r\n\r\nRun `bitcoin-qt` on a machine that has never run `bitcoin-qt` before.\r\n\r\nWhat version of Bitcoin Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)?\r\n\r\nBitcoin Core 0.16.2, downloaded from https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/\r\n\r\nWhat type of machine are you observing the error on (OS/CPU and disk type)?\r\n\r\nGNU/Linux x86 64-bit (Whonix 13, based on Debian Jessie, running under Qubes 3.2).  Haswell i7.  HDD.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any extra information that might be useful in the debugging process. -->\r\n<!--- This is normally the contents of a `debug.log` or `config.log` file. Raw text or a link to a pastebin type site are preferred. -->\r\n",
