That way if there are nodes that in fact support the newer protocol, but identify themselves as pre-209, they will still work.  If they don't support the newer protocol, the messages won't work anyway and nothing is lost.  Cases where this could potentially happen-- patched pre-209 reference clients, alternative clients, clients that mis-identify themselves in terms of version.  It just strikes me as being more fault-tolerant than disconnecting right away.\n\nThat said, it's probably not a huge deal.  Just thought I'd bring it up for consideration.",
