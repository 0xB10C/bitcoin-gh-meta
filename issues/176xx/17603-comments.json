      "body" : "The reason why you are only seeing one single input is because you are creating exactly 31 outputs. The code will create up to 10 size groups for a single destination, to avoid inadvertently creating massive transactions.\r\n\r\nIn your case, you will receive groups of 10, 10, 10, and 1 UTXO. The last one will obviously result in the most efficient transaction as it is 10x smaller than the others.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this results in 1499 btc being marked as dirty in this particular case, but I don't believe this is particularly common in the wild. It is not ideal for a regtest with avoidreuse enabled, though, that's for sure.\r\n\r\nTo see what I mean, change the 31 to 30 in your initial generate to $addr, then txid should give a tx with 10 inputs, not 1.",
