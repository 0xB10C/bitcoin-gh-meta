In the same way an experimental medical treatment is very real.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it's better to over-warn than to create false trust. Hopefully it triggers people to do their own research and not take things at face value. Also, compared to other currencies which have their roots hundreds or thousands of years ago, things are very experimental.\r\n\r\nI think this is a discussion that is mainly based on opinion and personal risk tolerances. There's a similar issue every few years. **Are we non-experimental yet?** If bitcoin survives, one day the answer will be obvious. But right now it's not so black or white, removing this word would be purely about signalling, but why?",
