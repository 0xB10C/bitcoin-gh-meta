There's a [TODO comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fee01bb053639f9e066ffb7ca72d7a5cb005d4b3/src/interfaces/chain.h#L37-L53) with similar suggestions.\r\n\r\n> * `initMessage`, `initError` and others could be moved in Node::interface\r\n\r\nThe `interfaces::Node` class is intended more for the gui and would give the wallet more functionality than it needs but I've previously thought these could go in a small `interfaces::Ui`  or `interfaces::WalletClient` class along with the `loadWallet` notification (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15288#discussion_r253322273)",
