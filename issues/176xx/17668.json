   "body" : "Once https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426 merged, we should keep drying up the interface to make it fully asynchronously, few ideas to brainstorm on:\r\n* all `getHeight`, `getBlockHeight` and `findFirstBlockWithTimeAndHeight`-style methods should be removed once rescan logic moved in its own thread behind the interface (I have already a functional branch for this)\r\n* all mempool related methods (`mempoolMinFee`) could be moved in its own Mempool::interface, client could care only about fee estimation, make it asynchronous too\r\n* `initMessage`, `initError` and others could be moved in Node::interface\r\n* `handleRpc` and others, wallet should have its own RPC server\r\n\r\nI think last two issues could be started today, they don't rely on any other PRs.\r\n\r\nWe may also have a `Broadcast` interface, tracking the chain state and broadcasting a tx are really 2 different logics.\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky pretty sure you have thoughts on it too.",
