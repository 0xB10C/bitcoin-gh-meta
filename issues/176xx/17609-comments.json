      "body" : "Sorry, x86_32 is on the way out. The last release that shipped binaries for 32-bit x86 Windows was 0.17.1. It was removed in #15939. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15939#issuecomment-489568065\r\n\r\n> This was bound to be a somewhat controversial decision: however one architecture per platform is great for maintenance-heavy outlier platforms such as Windows (and MacOSX). This allows for more focus in testing and, and hopefully a better user experience and better security, in time. Cross-compilation to windows is fraught with some risks, and they're minimized by only having one toolchain (mingw-w64) to check.\r\n\r\nIt *might* still be possible to build your own binaries, but no guarantees on that either. Your best chance of running Bitcoin Core on x86-32 is using Linux or a Linux VM.\r\n\r\n(x86-32 Linux builds might also be removed at some point in the futureâ#17504âthough not for the same reason, so less urgently.)\r\n\r\n",
