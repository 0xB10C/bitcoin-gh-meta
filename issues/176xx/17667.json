   "body" : "Once https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16426 merged, splitting our big `cs_wallet` into multiple ones would make sense because multiple RPCs won't be in conflict anymore to hold `cs_main`.\r\n\r\nNew locks like `cs_mapWallet` and `cs_mapTxSpends`, while handling well cases like we don't want to commit twice a coin to different transactions or return twice an address to avoid key reuse. Multiple \"read\" RPCs like `listtransactions` or `listsinceblock` should work smoothly concurrently without stopping each other.\r\n\r\nI don't know exactly what is possible but I think there is room for improvements and I don't plan to do it so feel free to dig into it.\r\n\r\nSee logs https://bitcoincore.reviews/16426.html for more context.",
