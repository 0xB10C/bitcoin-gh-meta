Fixing this would mean implementing a \"scalable\" input field that still performs well with large amount of pasted data, which is a non-trivial feat of UI engineering, so I've removed the \"Good first issue\" label.\r\n\r\nDoes this also happen if you use RPC through the cli? (if your shell runs into problems too, try input from stdin with `-stdin`, it's one reason that option was added)",
