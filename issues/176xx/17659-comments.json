Useful information to include: \r\n\r\n- details about how behavior changed, what behavior was before and after this change\r\n- a short description of the code changes, what was wrong with the old code, and how the commits relate to each other\r\n- how this compares to the alternative pr\r\n\r\nIt's great to link to other issues and pull requests in a PR description for extra details, but it shouldn't be necessary to open multiple other issues just to have a basic understanding of what a PR does and what motivated it",
