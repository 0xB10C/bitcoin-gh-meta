This is the way I would prefer when reviewing. Though, I will never review my own commits and if this makes review harder for others, I am happy to drop this habit.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that most of the time when I am looking at a diff I am not reviewing it, I'm trying to understand what it does. I review it after I understand what it does, not before. Making different changes in the same commit makes it take longer to figure out what the commit does.\r\n\r\nBut I actually don't understand what you're referring to with single git commands and calls stacks. I definitely think it's good to have a bugfix and tests for the bug in a single commit instead of different commits, because understanding the test can help you understand the bugfix and vice versa. I'm just requesting moving reformatting changes to separate commits from real code changes, because these aren't helpful to view together. Real changes break the flow of reviewing reformatting changes, and reformatting changes make it harder to find and notice real changes",
