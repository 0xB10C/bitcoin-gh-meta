I found myself in the position of needing to report the fee for compatibility with an existing protocol, but now I'm re-considering if that's the right thing to do - perhaps its better to show no fee than a misleading one.\r\n\r\n(This could even potentially be abused by making a transaction paying just the relay fee, then a descendant transaction with a high feerate paying to a victim to make him mistakenly believe that its likely to get confirmed soon. But thankfully no one is accepting unconfirmed payments, right? :stuck_out_tongue:)",
