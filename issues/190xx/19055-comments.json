      "body" : "@gzhao408 I think there is a bit of a miscommunication. The term \"rolling\" here just means efficient addition as well as deletion from the set being hashed. There is no actual window, as sets are unordered. Perhaps the term was chosen badly (which would be my fault).\r\n\r\nAll of LtHash, MuHash, and ECMH support incremental addition and deletion. The \"non-rolling\" mention in @fjahr's document refers to the fact that he hasn't implemented continuous UTXO set hashing with these functions, only a from scratch computation. It has nothing to do with what these functions can or can't do.\r\n\r\nThe primary difference between MuHash and ECMH is caching:\r\n\r\n* ECMH is more CPU time overall, but the time is mostly in computing the \"effect\" of a set of additions/deletions; applying that effect to the overall hash is extremely cheap. Furthermore, a 64-byte precomputed \"patch\" per set of additions/deletions can be created, which means a patch could be cached per-transaction, and then very cheaply applied when the transaction confirms. So it allows doing most of the work ahead of time (before the block arrives).\r\n\r\n* MuHash is cheaper overall, but the time is mostly in applying the changes to the overall hash. This means caching isn't very useful (and also the caches would be 768 bytes, which is pretty large). If the intent is computing things in the background, or at block connection time, then this is a better (and simpler) approach.",
