      "body" : "`onlynet=onion` guarantees that outgoing connections are made through Tor; incoming clearnet connections are still allowed. I think there's no reason to exclude non-broadcast activity from the Tor segment since being connected to more networks can only increase partitioning resistance.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think that `onlynet=onion` can create false expectations in terms of privacy because a node operating on both networks (due to incoming connections) will still broadcast through the clearnet.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have something like: `broadcast-network=ipv4,ipv6,onion` and make it inherit the `onlynet` parameter, or else default to Tor if Tor is running locally.\r\n\r\nWould there be any interest in this?",
