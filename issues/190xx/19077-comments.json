Maybe a comparison(-matrix) of internal vs. sqlite could be done?\r\n\r\nI think there's two primary reasons to choose sqlite over an internal format.\r\n\r\n1. Review and implementation are much simpler The library already exists so implementation just means correctly using the API. Reviewers won't have to review a file format implementation and convince themselves that that format won't corrupt and is robust.\r\n\r\n2. Better guarantees of consistency and non-corruption. SQLite is very well tested and very widely used. I think they are able better guarantee that data will get written, won't get lost, and won't get corrupted, than we would be able to with an internal format.\r\n\r\n> As for concrete implementation steps, maybe it would make sense to PR the DB flexibility first, then additional storage engines later.\r\n\r\n#18971 does the DB class stuff that gives us this flexibility. This PR is adding in the storage engine and the logic for CWallet to choose which storage to use.",
