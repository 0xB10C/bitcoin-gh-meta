If you do the latter, `listwalletdir` and the Open Wallet GUI need a trivial change.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 reasons. The first is that it's easier on review on implementation to stick to one filename. As you mentioned, if I make it `.sqlite`, `listwalletdir` and other places need to be changed. There are several places throughout the codebase where we specifically look for `wallet.dat` and not changing those to also use `wallet.sqlite` could be very bad. Additionally, some of those places may need to know whether they are looking for `wallet.dat` or `wallet.sqlite` so they would need access to whether a wallet is a descriptor wallet. They may need to know what kind of storage to look for which exposes more information than we currently already do. It's much simpler to just keep it `wallet.dat`. This avoids issues where the wrong filename could be used and makes review simpler.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that there are already lots of tooling, documentation, and discussion that use `wallet.dat`. Things like backup scripts or instructions telling people how to backup their wallet won't be invalidated as we keep the same naming. For the most part, the end user doesn't care about how the data is being stored within the file, they just need to know to preserve the `wallet.dat` file. So by keeping the naming, all of these things stay the same and make it less likely for people to lose their money.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, a few cases where tooling does need to be updated because of the format change. But this tooling is all for manual inspection of the wallet.dat file and most users aren't using that tooling.\r\n\r\n> Would it make sense to switch some of the records over to a format that's more easy to inspect with a SQLite viewer? As well as use tables like \"transactions\"? Or would that make this PR far too complicated?\r\n\r\nI would like to do that in the future. But I think that is too complicated for right now.",
