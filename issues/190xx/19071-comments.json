      "body" : "YMMV, and I'm surely lacking important context behind this, but here's an anecdote. I was lead maintainer in a team of four maintainers of a popular open source database search engine from 2013-2016. About a year after I decided to move on, it was decided to do something similar to this proposal for a part of the project. Some time was spent to separate it. After that, the split-off part of the codebase saw much less attention and love. Its contributors lost motivation. Two years after the split-off, it was decided to reintegrate it back into the project as before. Dev time and resources went into these transitions. /fin",
