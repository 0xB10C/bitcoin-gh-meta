That's the case for QT.\r\n\r\nWhen QT finds a problem with the index it will ask the user if they want to reindex. At that point it has already opened `blocks/index`.  It then runs this [while loop](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.16.0rc3/src/init.cpp#L1415) again with `fReset = 1`, resulting in the above error.\r\n\r\nThis change makes that error go away, presumably because `reset()` without an argument closes the file.",
