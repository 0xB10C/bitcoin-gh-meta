   "body" : "In case that it is a valid issue, this PR fixes #11561 (\"Negative version of transaction using json-rpc\").\r\n\r\nThe verbose output of the `getrawtransaction` RPC gives a response with a negative transaction version number if the MSB of the transaction version number is set.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can easily be reproduced by requesting the verbose transaction data of Mainnet transaction c659729a7fea5071361c2c1a68551ca2bf77679b27086cc415adeeb03852e369, via the `getrawtransaction` RPC, which gives a response with a negative transaction version number:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"version\": -1703168784,\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, commit 42df694 casts the transaction version number to an `uint64_t` and masks off its most significant 32 bits to pass a positive transaction version number to `UniValue::pushKV(const std::string&, uint64_t):bool`.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the example above it gives a response with a positive transaction version number:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"version\": 2591798512,\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis transaction version number is equal to the transaction version number created by block explorers that show a positive transaction version number. See for example:\r\n\r\n[Transaction c659729a7fea5071361c2c1a68551ca2bf77679b27086cc415adeeb03852e369  on Blockcypher.com](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/tx/c659729a7fea5071361c2c1a68551ca2bf77679b27086cc415adeeb03852e369)\r\n",
