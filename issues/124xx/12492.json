This was not observed to cause any issues on Fedora 23.\r\n\r\nAfter starting `bitcoin-qt` and when loading is complete (after the splashscreen disappears [Issue# 12355](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12355)) the thread io's sits near 99% for`bitcoin-qt [bitcoin-msghand]` for an extended period, until all outgoing connections are made or, until the blockchain is synced, I have not isolated which. During blockchain synchronization, I often only have a few outgoing connections but have a big list of `addnode=` in my conf file. When I come back later the required number of outgoing connections have been made, the blockchain is synced up to date and, the io's have dropped to a normal level and, the system is usable normally.\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-qt [bitcoin-msghand]` io's should not cause significant usability issues.",
