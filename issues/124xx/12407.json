   "body" : "In trying to rework (read: fix) the fork warning code (`validation.cpp:CheckForkWarningConditions*`), it became apparent that we are marking some (but not all) invalid blocks as invalid (via `nStatus`) when they are received and subsequently dropped. This prevents us from, for example, detecting and warning on invalid chains with significant work.\r\n\r\nThis change has `ProcessNewBlock` call `InvalidateBlock` on the invalid block to do the expected bookkeeping in `mapBlockIndex` before dropping the block. It also fixes a bug in `InvalidateBlock` which allows `NotifyBlockTip` to be called on blocks which aren't on the main chain, which can create unexpected behavior in anything that relies on `rpc/blockchain.cpp:latestblock` (e.g. `waitforblockheight`). Some logging was added that I found helpful during debugging.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of this changeset is test code. Future work on trying to repair the fork warning code will follow.",
