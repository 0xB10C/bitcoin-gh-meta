   "body" : "This is a quick fix for #12418, which is a regression in 0.16.\r\n\r\nIt permits specifying just the inner redeemscript to let `signrawtransaction` succeed. This inner redeemscript is already reported by `addmultisigaddress` & co.\r\n\r\n#11708 uses a different approach, where `listunspent` reports both inner & outer redeemscript, but requires both to be provided to `signrawtransaction`. Part of #11708 is still needed even in combination with this PR however, as currently the inner redeemscript isn't reported by `listunspent`.",
