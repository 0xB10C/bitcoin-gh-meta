Configure proxy information and correctly restart `bitcoin-qt`\r\n2. Clear all proxy information, IP addresses, ports, ignore the warnings as you do this, and then clear the proxy checkboxes.\r\n3. OK and then correctly restart `bitcoin-qt`\r\n4. When `bitcoin-qt` is loaded, go to Settings --> Options\r\n5. Crash\r\n\r\nConsole returns `Aborted (core dumped)`\r\n\r\n`bitcoin-qt` should not crash if all proxy information is cleared.\r\n\r\nNote: in my bitcoin.conf I currently have no proxy settings there either but, still several addnode={onion} lines (actually, tried now without those also). I previously had `proxy={proxy:port}` settings in the `bitcoin.conf` and have also previously set them in the GUI.\r\n\r\n`debug.log` says:\r\n\r\n    2018-02-21 10:15:47 GUI: ASSERT failure in QList<T>::at: \"index out of range\", file /home/ubuntu/build/bitcoin/depends/x86_64-linux-gnu/share/../include/QtCore/qlist.h, line 537\r\n\r\nNote that I am not on `/home/ubuntu/{etc}` - those paths do not exist on my system.\r\n\r\nAfter this, there is no way to get back into options, even setting `proxy={proxy:port}` AND `onion={proxy:port}` in `bitcin.conf` does not fix this.\r\n\r\nThis was discovered while checking for replication steps on an additional issue with proxy settings [Issue# 12499](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/12499).",
