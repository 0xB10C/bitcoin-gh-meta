This could create numerous issues, but it at least screws up `waitforblockheight` (or anything else relying on `rpc/blockchain.cpp:latestblock`) when InvalidateBlock is called on a block not in chainActive, which can happen via RPC.\r\n\r\nOnly call NotifyBlockTip when the block being marked invalid is on the active chain.",
