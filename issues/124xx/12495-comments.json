I've spent a lot of time the last three days reading the LevelDB source code and think I understand now. It actually has nothing to do with reducing the number of open/close/mmap/munmap syscalls, as I had originally thought.\r\n\r\nThe LevelDB terminology for a `.ldb` file is a \"table\", and the tables are composed of 4 KB blocks. Each table contains a block index, which is an index that can be used to determine which block a given key will be in. The block index for a given table file is loaded into memory when that table is opened.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the `max_open_files` here forces Bitcoin to keep much more of the block index data actually loaded into memory. I think it might be worth actually increasing the internal limits of LevelDB on the number of mmap files beyond 1000 on 64-bit Unix platforms, as that would result in the entire block index being loaded into memory. However I think we should start with this, and then consider increasing the limits once I've done more investigation into what the overhead is.",

      "body" : "I had a closer look at Windows and the way we use the win32 apis in LevelDB.\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n\r\n1. Win32RandomAccessFile does not use memory mapped files.\r\n2. The file opening and reading is done on the Win32 API level: CreateFile, ReadFile. There is no limit to the number of files that can be opened at this level (Use Window's HANDLES rather than FDs). Limits are at the C runtime library level but this is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nI am confident that this increase to 1000 files will not affect Windows. I have already tested this but will do more tests tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe Win32RandomAccessFile is as basic as it gets. Further optimizations can be made in this by using Memory Mapped files (Similar to the POSIX versions). The random access nature of accesses should be a win for Memory Mapped files over regular file read operations due to the kernel level caching.\r\nI will modify this and see if any significant performance improvements are achieved. I reckon it will.\r\n\r\nAs I've mentioned in #12123, we achieve optimization at CPU level also by avoiding the CRC checksum check that's performed on each file open.\r\n\r\n@eklitzke I hope you don't mind me replying on here. I'll continue to do more tests on the Windows sides of things. Any improvement to the IBD is a big win!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDonal",

This means on master the indexes use about 1 MB of memory, and with this branch they'll use about 20 MB of memory.

The chainstate database is larger than 4 GB. On such hosts, each open file handle really does use up a file descriptor, which can obviously lead to problems in a `select(2)` loop if the fd count exceeds 1024. I haven't posted this data yet, but I also have data showing a large speedup on POSIX hosts that have intermediate disk characteristics to what I posted earlier. That said: I really cannot imagine many users are running Bitcoin on 32-bit hosts, and it's easy enough to have conditional logic in that case anyway.\r\n\r\nI've been working on other LevelDB improvements that will result in even more significant improvements than what I've posted here, but they're more invasive changes. So I'm interested in getting this change (or a variant of it) merged before I try to go deeper into the UTXO system.\r\n\r\n@donaloconnor Can you comment on whether `select()` loops have the same 1024 fd limit on Windows?",
