   "body" : "This PR refactors the getblocktemplate_proposals.py functional test into a more general mining test, which covers the `submitblock` RPC as well as the `getblocktemplate` propose mode.\r\n\r\nMotivation was to add a regression test for #10146\r\n\r\nThis test removes all the manual block/transaction construction from the test case and uses the mininode classes to achieve the same tests. Result is less lines of code, and hopefully clearer and easier for people to extend/maintain since we're no longer hacking bits in a serialised block.\r\n\r\n@gmaxwell since he wrote the fix for #10146 \r\n\r\nEDIT: there are lots of commits in this PR to aid reviewers. They can be squashed down into larger commits before merging.",
