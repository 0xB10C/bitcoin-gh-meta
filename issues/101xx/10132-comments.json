      "body" : "Don't combine `-daemon` and `-printtoconsole`. They do opposite things. `-daemon` detaches the process from the terminal, `-printtoconsole` prints to the terminal. You just won't see it because the process has no controlling terminal anymore.\r\n\r\nThe reason that it works for the GUI is because `-daemon` is ignored for that. Daemons are background processes, while GUIs are decidedly foreground processes.",
