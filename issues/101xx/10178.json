Also bonus of getting two extra statics in.\r\n\r\nThis removes another callback from block connection logic, making it\r\neasier to reason about the wallet-RPCs-returns-stale-info issue.\r\n\r\nNote that this does a full mapWallet loop after the first block\r\nwhich is connected after restart. This is due to a previous bug\r\nwhere a coinbase transaction from the current best tip which\r\nexisted in wallet immediately prior to restart would not be shown\r\nin the GUI except because on-load -checkblocks would call\r\nDisconnectBlock and ConnectBlock on the current tip. To avoid\r\nmaking it worse (ie that such transactions would never be displayed\r\nuntil restart), a scan to find such transactions was added.",
