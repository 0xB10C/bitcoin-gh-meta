      "body" : "> This is because there is the potential for the size of the application to be larger then the size of the current screen, abs() should handle that corner case.\r\n\r\nThinking of it, I don't think abs fixes this problem. \r\nE.g. say the screen is 10x10, and the window 20x20. With the code without abs, the position of the window will be ((10-20)/2, (10-20)/2) or (-5,-5): screen will be centered in the center of the window instead of the other way around.\r\n```\r\n+-----------------|\r\n| window          |\r\n| +------------+  |\r\n| |            |  |\r\n| |  screen    |  |\r\n| |            |  |\r\n| +------------+  |\r\n|                 |\r\n+-----------------|\r\n```\r\nThis is not useful, as agreed. However abs would cause the window to be at (5,5), which reflects the coordinates over both axes and causes something like\r\n```\r\n+------------+\r\n| screen     |\r\n|   +-----------------+\r\n|   |  window|        |\r\n+---|--------+        | \r\n    |                 |\r\n    |                 |\r\n    +-----------------+\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure that makes sense. What would be the reasoning to put it there? A part of the window will still be outside the screen.\r\n\r\nIf the size of the application is larger than the size of the screen, wouldn't it be better to resize the application to fullscreen? Or alternatively, just ignore the hint, and leave the application at the default size in the center.",

If you do not do the abs() then the user does not have access to a single edge. The user cannot cannot easily grab the application and re-size/move it...hence the move and the abs() . \r\n\r\nWhile we could also resize the application to fit, I think if you do that there are many other considerations and the code starts to get messy. I did contemplate it, but this is really an extreme corner case we are talking about here. \r\n\r\nThe important point is that the user has a means of easily interacting with the application when it starts. By placing the application top right comer on the screen guarantees that the user can move & resize that application. Without the abs() that becomes much harder because the user has no edge to select and resize.     ",
