Signed ints are allowed in order to represent special values.\r\n- Explicitly wrap ids at max_int\r\n- Guard against duplicate ids. For example, if node 0 is still connected after ids have wrapped, make sure to skip over 0 when assigning the next id.\r\n\r\nnLastNodeId no longer needs to be atomic, as it's only touched under a lock.",
