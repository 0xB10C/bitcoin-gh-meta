      "body" : "Oh. Nice.\r\nI expected much more code to achieve this.\r\n\r\nConceptually I think this goes into the right direction, though, I'm not sure if this could end up being only a temporary in-between step that may end up being replaced.\r\nBecause, it may be more effective to split the Qt/d part completely and let them communicate over the p2p protocol (SPV and eventually RPC). More effective because it would also allow to run Qt independent from a trusted full node (if not trusted, use mechanism like full block SPV, etc.).\r\n\r\nThough, I'm aware that capnp has an RPC layer. But this would introduce another API (RPC / ZMQ / REST and then capnp RPC).\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this is the wrong direction, but we should be careful about adding another API.\r\n\r\nThree questions:\r\n- Would the performance be impractical if we would try to use the existing RPC API?\r\n- Could the capnp approach (or lets say IPC approach) be designed as a (or the) new API (\"JSON RPC v2\" and replacement for ZMQ)?\r\n- Does capnp provide a basic form of authentication? Would that even be required?",
