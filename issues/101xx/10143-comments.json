For example, if there's a global map<nodeid,int> that tallies sent bytes, that would be broken by duplicated values when ids wrapped.\r\n- determine when we assume that a nodeid is a unique identifier among current nodes.\r\n\r\nThe last one is what happens all over the place, and is fine as long as we ensure that the values really are unique. To do so, we can either:\r\n- maintain a set of currently used nodeids, and make sure that new values aren't in use before assigning a new one\r\n- disconnect all nodes when we hit max, forcing new connections starting from 0.\r\n\r\nObviously the first is cleaner, and would probably end up being simpler too.",

To begin with it will allow disconnecting and turning whitelisting on/off, and it can be added to later if people think further functionality is useful.\r\n\r\nI already have a branch with an updatenode RPC here: https://github.com/jnewbery/bitcoin/commit/5bbe24fd7597237388b73017036f5fe18c8470a6 . Adding a 'disconnect' argument to it is trivial.\r\n\r\nWe should keep this RPC hidden in order to not commit ourselves to a public API that we might want to change later (eg if we break out whitelisting into more granular behaviour at some point).\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

We may wish to disconnect/ban/whitelist/change other attributes/etc for peers, and having a single RPC that does all of that would be a sensible API, and certainly better than a different RPC for each attribute. On the other hand, I do agree that 'disconnect' is a verb, so naturally `updatenode disconnect` is a bit weird.",

I agree that the two arguments approach looks a bit odd when used as positional arguments, but it makes perfect sense when using named arguments: call the RPC with address=<address> if you want to disconnect by address, or call with nodeid=<nodeid> if you want to disconnect by nodeid. The fact that it works at all with positional arguments is more a historical quirk of bitcoin's RPC rather than a feature.\r\n\r\nI think any of the three approaches I've implemented are fine (overloading one argument, having a second argument or having a separate 'update peer' RPC). I really just want the functionality somewhere, and I'm happy to go along with the consensus view for where the best place to put it is.",

I think that's the right thing to do since the current name is misleading, but we'll need release notes to document the API change.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this argument is currently called 'node' and the help text say `(string, required) The node (see getpeerinfo for nodes)` is misleading at best. It currently only accepts a string which must match on the  CNode::addrName, which is the IP address/port.",

During my review flow I look at the code first, then read the comments before sending the ACK.\r\n\r\nGenerally I think it makes sense to keep breaking changes at a minimum or at least don't splatter them across consecutive releases. As we already have such a breaking change in 0.14.1 it makes sense to bundle this one in as well.\r\n\r\nWould you mind to create a minimal fix (similar to #10084) and tag that for backport? Not sure if it can into 0.14.1 at this stage, but having the pull open can not hurt.",
