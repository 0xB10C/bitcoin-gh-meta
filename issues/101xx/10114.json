However, none of the tests\r\ncurrently assert on sync_with_ping()'s return code. This commit adds an\r\nassert to sync_with_ping so the test will fail if the timeout expires.\r\n\r\nThis commit also removes all the duplicate implementations of\r\nsync_with_ping() from the individual tests.\r\n\r\nOnly the second commit here needs to be reviewed. The first commit https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/159fe88abfadf67410578c145e631819cf50b660 is #10109.\r\n\r\nShould fix the intermittent failure reported here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10073#issuecomment-289466653\r\n\r\nsync'ing and pinging @sdaftuar ",
