In my simulations FIFO and random selection performed reasonably well among naive approaches.\r\n\r\nOne of the coin selection strategies that I've evaluated for my Master's thesis was aiming to create a change output of the same size as the amount to send. This did not perform well as a singular strategy in my tests, however, you seem to have different criteria to evaluate fitness.",

      "body" : "@Xekyo  Keep in mind this isn't purely a \"optimize for amount of inputs\", as it only changes `ApproximateBestSubset` which is a fallback after the other stuff fails (which already heavily tries to consolidate utxo's). \r\n\r\nAlso one assumption you make, which doesn't necessarily hold up for \"power users\" is that sending transactions is the only way to consolidate the utxo set. This isn't really true for services anymore that are starting to do consolidation with ultra low-fee transactions for off peak times, and something that could even be exposed to the wallet directly.  \r\n\r\nSo for those reasons, I very much like greedy strategies that optimize for minimizing the inputs (and leaving big inputs if possible) -- especially if your simulations show they perform well anyway.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAlthough I kind of don't expect any make any progress to happen on coin selection as it's a lot of bike shedding, and everyone has different use cases that dictate different coin selection strategies. I think the best way would be to just code up a few simple strategies, and let users pick between them.\r\n\r\nOr another idea would be use a \"score\" based system. Where users can configure the score for different properties (e.g. optimizing for size, privacy, utxo consolidation, etc.) and then randomly generates 1000 (?) valid transactions, and picks the one with the best score",
