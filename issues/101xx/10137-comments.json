Can I suggest the following:\r\n\r\n- keep one PR open with a title like \"WIP: post 0.14.1 python code style nits\"\r\n- update it with all the style nits you find during the release cycle\r\n- rebase it as soon as 0.14.1 is branched from master.\r\n- only then ask for review/merge.\r\n\r\nThank you for your efforts to clean up the code. It's appreciated, but let's do it in a way that doesn't create undue work for reviewers and maintainers.",
