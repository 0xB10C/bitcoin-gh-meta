      "body" : "I believe we *won't* broadcast any transaction with fees > maxtxfee, because they won't be admitted to our mempool (all calls to `AcceptToMemoryPool()` in the wallet use `maxTxFee`, which gets set from the `-maxtxfee` argument here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8c28670e92b6422eb7576f074446238f9f221999/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L3918).\r\n\r\nI can't comment on the specific case you observed, since you haven't included details about the total fee attached to the transaction. Note that `-mxtxfee` is limiting the *total* fee, not the fee rate. `paytxfee`, on the other hand, sets the feerate in BTC per kB.",
