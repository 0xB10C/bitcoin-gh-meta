   "body" : "This is an experimental change, and a very early (not yet usable) work in progress. It adds some IPC functions and classes in [src/ipc/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/ipc) that let the `bitcoin-qt` process fork a `bitcoind` process and communicate with it over a socketpair.\r\n\r\nOnly a handful of IPC calls are implemented, but this demonstrates a working framework supporting bidirectional IPC calls (both requests from `bitcoin-qt` to `bitcoind`, and notifications from `bitcoind` to `bitcoin-qt`). The IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in `ipc/server.cpp` and `ipc/client.cpp`, and not in any headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\nThe main commit is bf5f8ed6f0124d65af0198b473cb25513fe84325 \"Add barebones IPC framework to bitcoin-qt and bitcoind.\"\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this change is to be able to start moving bitcoin from a monolithic architecture where UI, P2P, wallet, consensus, and database code all runs in a single process, to a more modular design. Splitting the bitcoin-qt code from the bitcoin node and wallet code seemed like a logical place to start because we already have separate bitcoin-qt and bitcoind binaries, and because the Qt code is already somewhat modularized thanks to various model classes.",
