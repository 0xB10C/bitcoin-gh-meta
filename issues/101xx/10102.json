   "body" : "**This is based on #10973.** The non-base commits are:\r\n\r\n- [`d3b5835368` Add support for Cap'n Proto in autotools build setup](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102/commits/d3b583536823edde61350c1388156f770782a5a7)\r\n- [`31d2b21e4c` Multiprocess bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10102/commits/31d2b21e4c4baa825c40baa2c08cae8262d5d9aa)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Current status:** This PR is a work in progress. Current code is in the middle of being reorganized and is messy and basically non functional. To try an earlier verison of the PR which is functional, use the [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commit/1f3b21b0b07e194c55c4cd0f0a6ed6756cf4e1c8) tag, which is also linked below.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an `--enable-multiprocess` configure option which will build new `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet`, and `bitcoin-gui` executables with node, wallet, and gui functionality isolated into different processes. See [doc/multiprocess.md](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/doc/multiprocess.md) for details.\r\n\r\nThis change adds an [`Init`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/init.h) interface that lets wallet and node interfaces be spawned in subprocesses and communicated with over a socketpair. You can see the IPC messages going back and forth by setting environment variable `IPC_DEBUG=1` before launching `bitcoin-gui` or `bitcoin-node`.) Followup PR will add `-ipcbind` and `-ipcconnect` options that allow more flexibility in how processes are connected.\r\n\r\nThe IPC protocol used is Cap'n Proto, but this could be swapped out for another protocol. Cap'n Proto types and libraries are only accessed in the [src/interfaces/capnp/](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/tree/pr/ipc/src/interfaces/capnp) directory, and not in any public headers or other parts of bitcoin code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSlides from a presentation describing the change are available on: [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeJ-7gD-dItUgs5yH-HoEzLvXaEWe_2ZiGUUxYIXcws/edit). Demo code used in the presentation was from an older version this PR (tag [ipc.21](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/releases/tag/pr%2Fipc.21), [commits](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/master...pr/ipc.21)).",
