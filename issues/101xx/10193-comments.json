If anybody can help with this it would be very welcomed.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot solve this soon or reverse_iterator.hpp is not acceptable even temporarily for some reason I suggest to go back to remove BOOST_FOREACH everywhere and #include <boost\\/foreach.hpp> everywhere except for the few places that use BOOST_REVERSE_FOREACH as a first step. But I hope we don't need to do that.\r\n",
