      "body" : "@gmaxwell there's certainly room for improvement, but this is a small (intentionally, to increase the change of it bring pulled) step towards making it get the blocks more quickly. This particular change has been tested in my fork for over a month, but I've also got other code that checks for stuck downloads (which then timeout's the askfor and asks elsewhere). Currently it's not ideal in that it often causes the same blocks to be downloaded from several nodes (as sometimes they do wake up again), so isn't as bandwidth efficient as I'd like it to be, and it also has various timeouts hardcoded, which is based on my internet connection. My eventual plan is to a patch that will determine the speed of the network and peers over time, and factor that knowledge into the block download process.\n\n@sipa, I see what you're saying. it does get modified from those two places. It seems to work though. Are you saying it could end up being two different values within the two different threads? I've never noticed this happen during over a month of testing so far. I could move the nAskedForBlocks++ code from ProcessMessages() into the socket handler thread. It probably belongs there more than ProcessMessages() now anyway, since it's not part of the strCommend == \"version\" code any longer. I was going to do this as a later pull, since as it is it works, and is less of a change to keep it in ProcessMessages(), and move it elsewhere later.",
