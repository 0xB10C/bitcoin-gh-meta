Nor is the goal to prevent any specific type or kind of transaction, spam or otherwise.   The goal is only to prevent particularly constructed chains of transactions which would serve to break critical functionality of the network.  Such chains are only likely constructed for the particular purpose of attacking the entire Bitcoin system, however, the limits proposed to prevent these attacks may inadvertently restrict non-attack transactions.   I'm just trying to be as transparent as possible by acknowledging that 2.6% of recent transactions would either have to have been delayed until some of their ancestors were included in blocks or constructed from different utxos if these limits had already been in place.\r\n",
