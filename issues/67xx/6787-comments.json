I wouldn't call it bug, but I agree, this can lead to confusion. It would probably be good, if `\"getrawtransaction\"` would have a similar behavior as `\"getransaction\"`, which indicates, whether a transaction is orphaned (`\"confirmations\": -1`), in the memory pool (`\"confirmations\": 0`), or confirmed (`\"confirmations\": >0`).\r\n\r\nIt's a coincidence that one was mutated, while the other wasn't.",
