      "body" : "Here's a more concrete proposal:  We already have `fSyncStarted` in the node state of `main.cpp`.  This is set to true when we start requesting headers from a particular node, so we can use it to *not* request headers from this node also following an inv message.  In addition, we have to reset the flag to false once we receive a headers message that does not have the maximum size - currently, it is never reset.\r\n\r\nAre there any problems with this approach or is it ok?  This is straight-forward to implement and fixes, as far as my preliminary testing goes, the issue.",
