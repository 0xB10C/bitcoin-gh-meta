      "body" : "It was fine until few days ago. I notice that hangup happens when bitcoind begin to read chainstate .ldb files on about 500Kb/s speed. That takes a long, processor is not loaded much, no response to p2p connections, rpc connects timing out... Another scenario is when bitcoind starts to write to .ldb files and becomes unresposive until finished. In that case it fully loads one of processor cores and memory use drops at the end of this process.\r\nI am solo mining using cgminer 4.9.2, so this may be also involved though no changes if I switch to the backup pool temporarily.\r\nWill set DB cache size relatively small just for the case if the reason is that my laptop processor core is not fast enough to deal with huge buffered data timely.\r\nThanks for response.",
