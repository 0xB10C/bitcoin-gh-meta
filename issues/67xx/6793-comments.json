To be slightly pedantic, you could view raising it to 5000 so mempools don't blow up as changing the meaning of it.  1000 is perfectly sufficient as a **relay fee** for now.  Almost every transaction that has ever been transmitted with a fee over 1000 has been mined, so that implies it's almost too HIGH of a fee as a min relay fee.  But I like raising it to 5000 and then revisiting in the context of #6722, possibly even lowering it again in backports in the future.",
