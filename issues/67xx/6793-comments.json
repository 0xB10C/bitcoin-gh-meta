To be slightly pedantic, you could view raising it to 5000 so mempools don't blow up as changing the meaning of it.  1000 is perfectly sufficient as a **relay fee** for now.  Almost every transaction that has ever been transmitted with a fee over 1000 has been mined, so that implies it's almost too HIGH of a fee as a min relay fee.  But I like raising it to 5000 and then revisiting in the context of #6722, possibly even lowering it again in backports in the future.",

This is worse for us than a hard fork, because for the hardfork you only need to update the node.\r\n\r\nOne alternative is to hardcode the limit of \"Dust\" to what it was before, I think you are raising this limit temporary anyway. The worse is that it is temporary ! Which mean that we will again need to go through the pain soon. If it is temporary, can't you change the Dust in a hardcoded value temporarily as well ?\r\n\r\nThe dust also does not change a lot for spamming ! Because you can just send those 600 satoshi to yourself so it does not cost you anything.\r\nReally, this is causing us unnecessary pain for something temporary and which can be fixed very easily by a hard coded value in IsDust() that we can reverse later :(",
