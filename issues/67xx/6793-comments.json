To be slightly pedantic, you could view raising it to 5000 so mempools don't blow up as changing the meaning of it.  1000 is perfectly sufficient as a **relay fee** for now.  Almost every transaction that has ever been transmitted with a fee over 1000 has been mined, so that implies it's almost too HIGH of a fee as a min relay fee.  But I like raising it to 5000 and then revisiting in the context of #6722, possibly even lowering it again in backports in the future.",

This is worse for us than a hard fork, because for the hardfork you only need to update the node.\r\n\r\nOne alternative is to hardcode the limit of \"Dust\" to what it was before, I think you are raising this limit temporary anyway. The worse is that it is temporary ! Which mean that we will again need to go through the pain soon. If it is temporary, can't you change the Dust in a hardcoded value temporarily as well ?\r\n\r\nThe dust also does not change a lot for spamming ! Because you can just send those 600 satoshi to yourself so it does not cost you anything.\r\nReally, this is causing us unnecessary pain for something temporary and which can be fixed very easily by a hard coded value in IsDust() that we can reverse later :(",

That is, if a transaction is not confirmed within n blocks (say 5), it is dropped from the mempool (for non-high priority). This will require the sender to re-send.\r\n\r\nThe number of blocks can be a function of the fee. i.e. 1 satoshi = 1 block, 10 satoshi = 2 blocks, 100 satoshi = 3 blocks, 1000 satoshi = 4 blocks. 4000 satoshi can be 1 day. \r\n\r\nAnything over 4000 can be treated 'business as usual'",

(although not necessarily unwarranted in drastic times) Many wallets will be forced to rush out updates, and even more users will find their software broken until they update. Getting 100% of users to update or reconfigure their software is a long process. Thankfully we have an api hook in place for breadwallet to bump fees remotely (within a hard coded range limit for security)",
