      "body" : "I was playing around with this a little bit.\r\nAfter a little research, if found out that there is no way in overriding the copy'n'paste behavior, though, it would be possible to detect the `Ctrl-C` keyEvent and perform different things based on that. But it would also require signal catching for the context menu (Right-Mouse-Button->Menu->Copy) as well as for some linux copy'n'pase behavior (middle mouse button?).\r\n\r\nNot sure if it's worth hacking down a such implementation.\r\n\r\nIf somebody has interest to go down this rabbit hole, here is a starting point: https://github.com/jonasschnelli/bitcoin/commit/6ca2dbf99b240fbf8567357815f60b9609c00f9b\r\n\r\nAlthough: JSON pretty print and a short cut for directly opening the rpc console window would be nice!",
