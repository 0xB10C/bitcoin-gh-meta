I've subsequently gone around and caused several parties (like electrum) to update their behavior.\r\n\r\nThis could also be coupled with a change that automatically 'fixes' failing transactions, mutating them instead of causing them to be be rejected completely-- a prospect which is much less unappealing now that malleability attacks are already going on. However, if LowS becomes even more widespread quickly this change alone may be enough.\r\n",
