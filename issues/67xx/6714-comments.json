So I will update the initial post with the \"current proposed API\", even if it's a C++ instead of a C API (functions will be the analogous of  ```VerifyScript``` not of ```bitcoinconsensus_verify_script``` )  and there's open questions like how to \"break\" CBlockIndex and CCoinsViewCache.\r\n\r\nRegarding your comment about libconsensus being stateless and the UTXO being passed somehow, that's what I mean by \"breaking CCoinsViewCache\" which is I believe the hardest part of designing this API and will probably generate more controversy (since I'm sure there will be alternative proposals).\r\nMy initial design draft is \"one or more function pointers to retrieve data, basic C types or structs at most\", but there's still several ways to do that.\r\nI believe the CBlockIndex case is much simpler and we should deal with that first (see #5995).\r\nVerifyTx requires breaking CCoinsViewCache, VerifyHeader requires breaking CBlockIndex and VerifyBlock requires both.\r\n",

Basically, I want multiple threads to be able to call TestBlockValidity() with different blocks (why? because I intend to implement 'weak block' announcements, where miners tell their peers about blocks they're working on and the peers pre-validate them).  (this could also speed up RPC getblocktemplate 'proposal', and might even be a big win for normal operation, if block validation doesn't have to hold the cs_main lock for long periods of time)\r\n\r\nI THINK that means a design where the context from previous blocks in the chain is encapsulated in some kind of data structure and passed into TestBlockValidity. I'd like to write code that does something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReceiveWeakBlock(CBlock& block)\r\n{\r\n    LOCK(cs_main);\r\n    if block->prev isn't current tip: ignore\r\n    BlockValidationContext = snapshot of information from best chain and snapshot of the UTXO state\r\n        (snapshot of UTXO state probably implemented as an actual leveldb read-only snapshot).\r\n    schedule a task to validate the block with the BlockValidationContext, but skipping the POW check...\r\n    ...

      "body" : "After thinking about these issues a bit more, it seems we're conflating several goals in this, and while these goals are complementary in the long run, in the short term this kind of work requires an even greater level of architectural sophistication that strongly takes dependencies and all the development dynamics into account. We really need to take a step back from the code and think high level design.\r\n\r\n## Goal 1: Splitting consensus code from nonconsensus code\r\nThis is the literal stated goal of this thread. It is indeed a crucial long-term goal, I hardly think a justification is needed at this point. However, after a bit more discussion and thought it seems that perhaps creating a libconsensus is not the best place to start. I think we agree that most urgent is the encapsulation, not so much the packaging. We should probably forget about a C interface (or any other language bindings) for now.\r\n\r\n## Goal 2: Better code organization\r\nI don't think I need to convince anyone here that main.cpp is a horrendous mess. The fact that much of this code is consensus-critical makes things a heck of a lot worse...but even if this were a completely different type of app without such stringent security requirements, this would still be a serious problem in itself. It is seriously hurting recruitment into the project, it is creating enormous bottlenecks in testing and code review...and it is a vicious cycle. Even though most of the core developers are aware of these issues, we've been inadvertently promoting a culture where people try to change as few lines of code as possible and greatly limit their ambitions in the hopes of getting their stuff reviewed and merged quickly lest they suffer months of continuous rebasing...and this tends to lead to an even greater scattering of logic across the codebase in the long run, making refactors even harder...and perhaps even more importantly, making it harder to bring new people up to speed. We need to change this pattern.\r\n\r\n## Goal 3: Layered architecture with less stable layers built atop more stable ones\r\nWe've come a long ways since the very early days of this codebase in terms of reducing our complex web of dependencies - but we still have a good ways to go. It is self-evident: the less we need to be tinkering with lower layer stuff in ways that are negatively felt by those atop it and the more that people working atop it can tinker without the risk of breaking something below, the freer we **all** are to tinker generally.\r\n\r\nThese three stated goals are inextricably intertwined. Perhaps we should seriously take a step back and contemplate everything...and come up with a plan that addresses all these concerns that can be broken down into small palatable steps before just jumping into doing the steps.",
