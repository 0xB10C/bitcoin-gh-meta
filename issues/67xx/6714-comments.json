For that reason and following @sipa 's and your advice I will prepare an independent document plan for the encapsulation part \"with words and pictures\".\r\n\r\nBut the API is also important and even if not so doable in the short term, it's never too late to start discussing it. So I will update the initial post with the \"current proposed API\", even if it's a C++ instead of a C API (functions will be the analogous of  ```VerifyScript``` not of ```bitcoinconsensus_verify_script``` )  and there's open questions like how to \"break\" CBlockIndex and CCoinsViewCache.\r\n\r\nRegarding your comment about libconsensus being stateless and the UTXO being passed somehow, that's what I mean by \"breaking CCoinsViewCache\" which is I believe the hardest part of designing this API and will probably generate more controversy (since I'm sure there will be alternative proposals).\r\nMy initial design draft is \"one or more function pointers to retrieve data, basic C types or structs at most\", but there's still several ways to do that.\r\nI believe the CBlockIndex case is much simpler and we should deal with that first (see #5995).\r\nVerifyTx requires breaking CCoinsViewCache, VerifyHeader requires breaking CBlockIndex and VerifyBlock requires both.\r\n",
