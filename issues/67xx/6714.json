   "body" : "There have been multiple discussions about completing libconsensus in the mailing list but they are hard to find.\r\nHere's a detailed plan \r\n\r\nGoals: \r\n\r\n1) Complete libconsensus's C API with the following functions: VerifyScript, VerifyHeader, VerifyTx and VerifyBlock. Possibly also: CheckTransaction/Consensus::CheckTx, Consensus::CheckTxInputs, Consensus::CheckTxInputsScripts (doesn't exist yet in master), CheckBlockHeader, ContextualCheckBlockHeader, CheckBlock and ContextualCheckBlock.\r\n\r\n2) Maintain libconsensus as a stateless library that doesn't have its own storage.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the concrete final C API, here's some things we do know now and if done in advance, would simplify the task of reviewing concrete C API's proposals:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Separate consensus critical code into different files. Right now, if one wants to propose a concrete C API without moving any code, he needs to include main.cpp (and its abundant dependencies) in the libconsensus build. This goes against goal 2.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Remove depencies that use globals (like Params()/pCurrentParams, util::mapArgs or util::error/util::LogPrintStr/fPrintToConsole_and_friends).\r\n\r\nThe most complicated part of proposing a concrete C API is to somehow interface with the equivalent of CBlockIndex and CCoinsViewCache (which depend on storage) in Bitcoin Core:\r\n\r\n- [ ] C-compatible API for CBlockIndex\r\n- [ ] C-compatible API for CCoinsViewCache\r\n- [ ] Discuss and accept a complete C API for libconsensus.\r\n \r\nIf you think this plan is not detailed enough, please make concrete suggestions or questions: \"this is not well documented enough\" is not very useful as feedback.\r\n",
