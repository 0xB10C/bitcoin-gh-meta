Until that point, we should treat the consensus rules as under debate, and for soft-fork safety, that means spends should be treated as non-standard.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to go further: don't relay them unless the consensus rules are actually active for the next block. This extends non-relay to the period where a deployment is defined, started, locked in, or failed. I see no downsides to this, and the code change is very simple.",
