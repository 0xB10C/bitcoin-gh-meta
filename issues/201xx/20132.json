   "body" : "This is a brainstorming issue on the dev docs. \r\n\r\nMy personal view is that there are high risk (consensus code), medium risk (non consensus code, GUI?), low risk (tests), very low risk (docs) contributions in terms of introducing bugs, vulnerabilities and so a review process that makes sense for consensus code doesn't make much sense for docs. \r\n\r\nI am not proposing to have a completely different review process for docs as that would certainly get some NACKs. But I wonder if we could encourage use of simple ACKs and NACKs (Concept ACK, Approach ACK don't make much sense in a doc scenario) and that doc nits can generally be addressed in a follow up PR if the nit commenter cares that much about the nit. \r\n\r\nWe certainly don't want inaccuracies or poor quality docs introduced to the Core repo. So an ACK/NACK review is still important. And if a reviewer feels strongly enough that a certain doc PR is a deterioration we absolutely need a NACK. But we also want to avoid circles of conflicting nits because reviewers feel that they need to review in the same meticulous way as they review consensus code. I observe people generally want to add nits rather than a simple ACK because it feels as if they are being helpful.\r\n\r\nAll dev docs don't need to and shouldn't be forced into this repo. There are alternative locations that may be more appropriate. There is the [bitcoin-devwiki](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki) under the bitcoin-core [organization](https://github.com/bitcoin-core). There are dev docs in  [btcinformation.org](https://btcinformation.org/en/bitcoin-for-developers) (@harding and @achow101 are contributors) and [bitcoin.org](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/). There is [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/en/faq/optin_rbf/) which doesn't seem to have had any new additions in recent years. And then there is [Bitcoin StackExchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/) if you can't find your content elsewhere. I think a \"NACK, this PR should be one of these alternative locations\" is perfectly reasonable feedback.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of initial ideas for improving the dev docs in this repo. The [developer notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md) is very long now and should in my opinion be split up into separate docs. I think we should have a bitcoin/doc/developer directory with dev docs in them. I don't think we should be afraid of introducing concepts and links to other resources, related PRs, related PR review club sessions, transcripts of relevant presentations in docs like [multiprocess.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/multiprocess.md). For example, that doc hasn't been updated since July 2019 (no criticism intended but this may be due to docs being lesser priority, the headache of nit reviews, or merely the confusion of which location certain information should go.) Or alternatively a lot of this stuff should move to the bitcoin-devwiki and that should be pointed to as the first point of call.\r\n\r\n(Note that ideally we only want to link to resources that will still be there in 5-10 years. Bitcoin StackExchange, @kanzure  transcript [site](https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/), PRs etc have stood test of time in terms of immutable links and I am confident that Bitcoin Core PR review club will too.)\r\n\r\nIf we start splitting up longer docs we can potentially draw in docs like [some](https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core) of @jonatack docs that I regularly direct people to rather than the Bitcoin Core repo or bitcoin-devwiki. Or some of the related dev content on Stack Exchange such as [this](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98398/what-is-the-motivation-behind-russell-yanofskys-work-to-separate-bitcoin-core-i/) on multiprocess.\r\n\r\nThese are personal views and I welcome thoughts and feedback (NACKs welcome).\r\n\r\n",
