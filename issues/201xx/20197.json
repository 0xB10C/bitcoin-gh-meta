   "body" : "Now that #19991 is merged, and tests for it are being added in #20172, we have a more robust way to determine inbound onion peers using `CNode::m_inbound_onion` rather than `IsLocal()`.\r\n\r\nUse it for the new `AttemptToEvictConnection` logic that was added in #19670 to address issue #19500.\r\n\r\nI'm re-opening this patch in the hope that this time it might not be railroaded into requests for review of other work that I've already reviewed or to do out-of-scope refactoring here of `AttemptToEvictConnection`. This is essentially a one-line change, and it doesn't seem to be the appropriate place to draw a line in the sand over testability refactoring of `AttemptToEvictConnection`.",
