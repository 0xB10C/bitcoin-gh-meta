   "body" : "This changes `-wallet` setting to only load existing wallets, not create new ones.\r\n\r\n- Fixes settings.json corner cases reported by sjors & promag: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/issues/95, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19754#issuecomment-685858578, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19754#issuecomment-685858578\r\n\r\n- Prevents accidental creation of wallets reported most recently by jb55 http://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2020-09-14.html#l-355\r\n\r\n- Simplifies behavior after #15454. #15454 took the big step of disabling creation of the default wallet. This PR extends it to avoid creating other wallets as well. With this change, new wallets just aren't created on startup, instead of sometimes being created, sometimes not. #15454 release notes are updated here and are simpler.\r\n\r\nThis change should be targetted for 0.21.0. It's a bug fix and simplifies behavior of the #15937 / #19754 / #15454 features added in 0.21.0.",
