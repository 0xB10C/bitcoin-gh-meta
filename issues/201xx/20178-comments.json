I found this transaction which involves spending of non-standard UTXOs : fac212a142cfeaaaa03fc32ec419e72c650b7f1878723eab72e50e6d60fb39eb\r\n\r\nIts not a segwit transaction but still relevant because of the inputs being non-standard. It was included in block 473629 which was mined by BTCC mining pool. Not sure if the mining pool still works because I couldn't find the website for mining pool. This web archive link had one email address: https://web.archive.org/web/20181127190516/https://btccpool.com/  which you can use to contact them for help (I have tried sending test email and got no bounceback).
