It is the \"building themselves\" crowd that I had in mind here, especially on OS X, given your build documentation for users involves Homebrew already, and internalising everything into one script helps reduce variables that crop up as in #5147. This is a kind of extension of your build documentation, but reduces the amount end users have to do and the places where that can go wrong to nil. (*Theoretically*).\r\n\r\nI wasn't deliberately proposing a third option, my opinion was more \"Hey, this could be your building yourself option for OS X\".\r\n\r\nI don't have anything against pre-distributed dmg files at all, and I'd certainly generally desire and urge people to use those instead of building the tools here themselves, but this being the crypto world there is always going to be an element who stare at pre-distributed binaries with some suspicion.\r\n\r\nMy point largely was that you already involve Homebrew in your [documentation for osx](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md), so this is just an extension of that, but as I said, I only really threw this together to check there wasn't any SSLv2 errors on Homebrew's end of the deal for #5147, and it just occurred to me afterwards that it might be useful for that minority of users on OS X who decide to build these things themselves instead of trusting a dmg.\r\n\r\n(*Again, I have no beef against signed distributed binaries*).",

If you want it in, I'll make whatever changes you see fit. \r\n\r\nNote that Homebrew will almost certainly *never* accept a bitcoind formula into the core, so there is zero chance of this ever being \"bottled\". Bottles are only generated by the core formulae and certain specific other taps. Bottles are not generated for every formulae in every tap, Homebrew doesn't have the resources to quite manage that I suspect.\r\n\r\nYou can also add an extremely simple build-flag to the instructions to ensure every dependency is built-from-source as well, so everything comes by source. It takes longer, but if you want source that's something Homebrew can bend to extremely easily.",

The PATH ENV setting does something similar, it just moves the internal BDB4 location to the front of the PATH so the build script finds it first and foremost.

It's a perfectly valid and solid way of finding the BDB4 dependency for Bitcoin, but it can be a pain in terms of if you use Homebrew but have the BDB4 you want to use elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf I can't get it to take flags or PATH temporary amendments without still bumping into the issue I may end up inserting a tiny patch to the configure script in the formula on my end to ensure it finds our BDB4 instead of Homebrew's default.",
