This is basically a reinvention of bitcoin URIs/the payment protocol with a different technical realization.\r\n\r\nThough maybe ideas such as payment-protocol-over-websockets would be useful in some circumstances, I don't know.\r\n\r\nBut as most people use different wallets than bitcoin-qt by now, this is not the right place for a blue-skies proposal like this. I'd suggest the bitcoin-development mailing list for discussion, more wallet authors are there.\r\n",
