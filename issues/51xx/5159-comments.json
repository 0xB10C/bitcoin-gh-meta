I think we should also change `txconfirmtarget` to default to 2 or higher for non QT usage.  1 is just dangerous given the fact that it's often impossible to be reliably confirmed in 1 transaction.    Separately, #4082 is a somewhat substantial problem though.   Is anyone working on the fixes @gavinandresen and @gmaxwell suggested?  I just want to be sure we tie all these changes together to work well.",

If that code ever gets moved out of main, I think it makes sense for those two checks on inputs to stay together.  However if you don't like that, I can revert back to putting the logic inside `CTxMemPoolEntry` and I'll just call the constructor with a reference to the mempool itself.  In both cases it now checks to be sure inputs aren't in the mempool as you suggest, as opposed to checking that they are in the chain as in my original version.  I renamed the variable and also fixed the portability issue I think.\r\n\r\n ",

But I do agree that if/when this is going to be merged, the GUI could be slightly modified to better handle the case where 1 doesn't give an estimate.  It's not always a matter of not having enough data, but sometimes there really is no answer to the question, because  there is no fee that is high enough that you'll reliably (> 85%) get confirmed within 1 block.  In any case, I was operating under the assumption that this wasn't making it in for 0.10, so I was planning on waiting for that and then rebasing.  I also have a couple small improvements to make.",
