If that is the bug, and I think a more minimal and elegant fix might just be to make the pruning code resilient to files temporarily being unlinkable because they are in-use, and to just retry and delete them later on the next round of pruning.\r\n\r\n@ryanofsky yes, thank you for the suggestion. I've implemented that in #26533. I think that's a better/less invasive solution than what I have proposed in #26316.\r\n",
