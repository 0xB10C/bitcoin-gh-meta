   "body" : "Potentially fixed https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17161. \r\n\r\nIt seems there's a race in `ReadBlockFromDisk` where after the block file position is retrieved the actual block file could be removed during prune. This could just cause the read to fail, or it could leave the file in an inconsistent state depending on the platform. This PR uses a shared mutex to lock the removal of files until any reads are completed. This way it doesn't block `cs_main` while reading so `ReadBlockFromDisk` usage can be moved outside of `cs_main` in some cases like https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26308.",
