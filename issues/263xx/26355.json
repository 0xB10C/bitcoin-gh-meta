   "body" : "This PR fixes a bug in the headers sync logic that enables submitting headers to a nodes block index that don't lead to a chain that surpasses our DoS limit.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that we ignore the return value on [the first `IsContinuationOfLowWorkHeadersSync` call after a new headers sync is started](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fabc0310480b49e159a15d494525c5aa15072cba/src/net_processing.cpp#L2553-L2568), which leads to us passing headers to [`ProcessNewBlockHeaders`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fabc0310480b49e159a15d494525c5aa15072cba/src/net_processing.cpp#L2856) when that initial `IsContinuationOfLowWorkHeadersSync` call returns `false`. One easy way (maybe the only?) to trigger this is by sending 2000 headers where the last header has a different `nBits` value than the prior headers (which fails the pre-sync logic [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fabc0310480b49e159a15d494525c5aa15072cba/src/headerssync.cpp#L189)). Those 2000 headers will be passed to `ProcessNewBlockHeaders`.\r\n\r\nI haven't included a test here so far because we can't test this without changing the default value for `CRegTestParams::consensus.fPowAllowMinDifficultyBlocks` or doing some more involved refactoring.",
