   "body" : "ref #23119: Updated a subset of the test cases to get approach feedback before making a large amount of changes that may need to change again. \r\n\r\nApproach:\r\n\r\n- assert_equal is preferred over assert where possible. \r\n- A matching assert_not_equal function has been added also. \r\n- Where assert_equal is not possible, the built-in assert function will be used. \r\n- Other variations of assert will be removed.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\nThis has been discussed in a few PRs / Issue.  The most recent consensus is that a [minimal approach](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25732) is best. \r\n\r\n",
