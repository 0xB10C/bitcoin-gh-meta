      "body" : "Interesting Script edge case!\r\n\r\nYou must have balanced the cost of proposing this standardness rule change, and making a PR touching consensus code, with switching to using Segwit scripts (either v0 or v1) which don't have this limitation (and have other advantages). Is there a particular reason why you can't migrate to Segwit?\r\n\r\n> Motivation for Changing Bitcoin's standard rules\r\n> Since having two execution paths for two different multisigs, one of them usually time-locked, is a very common use case, Bitcoin users can benefit from relaxing the standard rule and making two-paths multisigs standard.\r\nThe alternate way of having two-paths multisigs is by adding the CHECKMULTISIG at the end of every path. However, this reduces the maximum number of functionaries of the first (non time-locked) multisig, since the sum of both must be below 15.\r\n\r\nBitcoin users would probably just do that under P2WSH or Taproot nowadays. And that would be standard. But even under P2SH context it's far from being the only alternative. You could also just count public keys, for instance (untested):\r\n```\r\nIF\r\n  <pk_1> CHECKSIG SWAP\r\n  <pk_2> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  ...\r\n  <pk_n> CHECKSIG ADD\r\n  <m> EQUAL\r\nELSE\r\n  <timelock> CSV DROP\r\n  <pk_1'> CHECKSIG SWAP\r\n  <pk_2'> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  <pk_3'> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  <pk_4'> CHECKSIG ADD\r\n  <3> EQUAL\r\nENDIF\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a small number of pubkeys this is standard under P2SH, and the next limit you'd hit would probably be `MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE` that limits the size of the redeem Script.\r\n\r\nWriting Scripts by hand is a huge footgun, and we now have [tooling to do that safely](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). The implementation of Miniscript in Bitcoin Core does not support P2SH context. But [other implementations do](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript) if you really can't migrate to at least Segwit v0.",

All the code that produces and interprets Bitcoin transactions is consensus code in RSK. \r\nOur current highest priority is to unblock the funds in the peg (currently one or more mining pools will temporarily help RSK to deliver the non-standard transactions into blocks, but this is far from ideal, as it affects RSK decentralization). \r\nWe cannot migrate to segwit as an emergency hard-fork. It would need months of development, months of testing, more months for activation on testnet, etc. We have already created a patch to migrate to the following redeem script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOP_NOTIF \r\n\t...\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_N \r\n\tOP_CHECKMULTISIG\r\nOP_ELSE \r\n\tâ¦\r\n\tOP_PUSHNUM_4 \r\n        OP_CHECKMULTISIG\r\nOP_ENDIF \r\n\r\n```\r\nBut this is still a hard-fork, and the full upgrade can take several weeks, considering the public review stage and all further stages.\r\n\r\nThe RSK community mid-term plan is to migrate to segwit. \r\n\r\nRegarding touching the consensus code, I firmly believe that GetSigOpCount() should be split in two functions: one that is called only by consensus code and one that is only called by AreInputsStandard(). This is obvious to me, since the standard rules can change over time, but not the consensus rules, and there is a real risk that a tweak of the standard rules ends up hiding an unintended consensus change. I was surprised to discover that GetSigOpCount() is called by consensus code with fAccurate==true and fAccurate==false, so basically that function should be set in stone.\r\n\r\nTherefore, even if the you are in doubt if the addition of two-paths multisigs is a benefit, I hope you still see the benefit to split GetSigOpCount() into two initially mirrored functions with different names, and we can do this in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n",

But proposing a standardness rule change does not seem like a short-term plan to me: even in the best case scenario that this PR is getting enough interest, review (i haven't looked at the code yet but it's currently failing CI) and gets eventually merged before the next release branch-off, then that a release gets shipped with the new standardness rule and that at least part of the nodes and hashrate upgrade to this new rule. That's what, 1 year at least before your transactions get relayed? Is it reasonable to rely on direct communication with mining pools for that long? And won't the switch to Segwit happen before that?",

      "body" : "Regarding the CI failure, I fixed it. But this brings an interesting topic to discuss (separate of this patch):\r\n\r\nInvalid scripts are detected obviously at some later moment and transactions containing invalid scripts are never accepted into the memory pool.\r\nHowever, in case GetStandardSigOpCount() detects and invalid script (i.e. staring with ENDIF)  it's difficult to decide what GetStandardSigOpCount() should return.  If it returns 0, you let a script containing too many checksigs be executed by the node. This is bad, but gives the node the opportunity to ban the peer that sent the invalid transaction. If it returns a high value, you avoid high computations, but at the same time you do not get the chance to penalize the peer that sent the bad transaction.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, on an invalid script detected:\r\n\r\noption 1) return 20 -> avoid heavy computations, do not penalize\r\noption 2) return 0 -> let  heavy computations be performed, penalize\r\noption 3) continue but  revert to how the old GetSigOpCount() worked\r\n\r\nMy code currently does 3, from the point the script is detected as invalid.",
