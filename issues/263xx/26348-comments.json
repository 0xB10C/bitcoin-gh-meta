      "body" : "Interesting Script edge case!\r\n\r\nYou must have balanced the cost of proposing this standardness rule change, and making a PR touching consensus code, with switching to using Segwit scripts (either v0 or v1) which don't have this limitation (and have other advantages). Is there a particular reason why you can't migrate to Segwit?\r\n\r\n> Motivation for Changing Bitcoin's standard rules\r\n> Since having two execution paths for two different multisigs, one of them usually time-locked, is a very common use case, Bitcoin users can benefit from relaxing the standard rule and making two-paths multisigs standard.\r\nThe alternate way of having two-paths multisigs is by adding the CHECKMULTISIG at the end of every path. However, this reduces the maximum number of functionaries of the first (non time-locked) multisig, since the sum of both must be below 15.\r\n\r\nBitcoin users would probably just do that under P2WSH or Taproot nowadays. And that would be standard. But even under P2SH context it's far from being the only alternative. You could also just count public keys, for instance (untested):\r\n```\r\nIF\r\n  <pk_1> CHECKSIG SWAP\r\n  <pk_2> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  ...\r\n  <pk_n> CHECKSIG ADD\r\n  <m> EQUAL\r\nELSE\r\n  <timelock> CSV DROP\r\n  <pk_1'> CHECKSIG SWAP\r\n  <pk_2'> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  <pk_3'> CHECKSIG ADD SWAP\r\n  <pk_4'> CHECKSIG ADD\r\n  <3> EQUAL\r\nENDIF\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a small number of pubkeys this is standard under P2SH, and the next limit you'd hit would probably be `MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE` that limits the size of the redeem Script.\r\n\r\nWriting Scripts by hand is a huge footgun, and we now have [tooling to do that safely](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). The implementation of Miniscript in Bitcoin Core does not support P2SH context. But [other implementations do](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript) if you really can't migrate to at least Segwit v0.",
