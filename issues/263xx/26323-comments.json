The next release is going to be in ~6 months anyways, by which point the default would be to enable. Not many people run pre-release builds so I wouldn't expect this to make much of a difference on testnets. Additionally, enabling full RBF now (before the next release) by merging #26305 would have the same effects on testnet, and would have the same effect of signaling that opt-in RBF will be going away. If the goal is to signal that opt-in RBF is going away soon, I think that has already been sufficiently signaled via the bitcoin-dev discussion as well.",

However, the remaining open question sounds to be more on the deployment timeframe. It should be noted the difference between this current PR and #26305 are really lightweight, if Core binds to its release schedule of a new version every 6 months. At the same time it provides a clear time point for zero-conf services operators, independently of the aleas of release candidates, on the assumption next release is tagged before 1st May 2023.\r\n\r\nThis left as a remaining wonder if there is any objection among zero-conf services operators over a ~6 months timeframe to upgrade or harden their services. I don't know if some zero-conf services operators relying on PoS (e.g Bitcoin ATMs) might need longer deployment cycles.     ",
