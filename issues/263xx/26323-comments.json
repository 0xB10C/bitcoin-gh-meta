The next release is going to be in ~6 months anyways, by which point the default would be to enable. Not many people run pre-release builds so I wouldn't expect this to make much of a difference on testnets. Additionally, enabling full RBF now (before the next release) by merging #26305 would have the same effects on testnet, and would have the same effect of signaling that opt-in RBF will be going away. If the goal is to signal that opt-in RBF is going away soon, I think that has already been sufficiently signaled via the bitcoin-dev discussion as well.",
