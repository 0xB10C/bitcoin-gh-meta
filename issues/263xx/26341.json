   "body" : "This PR adds a fixed false-positive element check to the functional test rpc_scanblocks.py by using a pre-calculated scriptPubKey that collides with the regtest genesis block's coinbase output. Note that determining a BIP158 false-positive at runtime would also be possible, but take too long (we'd need to create and check ~800k output scripts on average, which took at least 2 minutes on average on my machine).\r\n\r\nThe introduced check is related to issue #26322 and more concretely inspired by PR #26325 which introduces an \"accurate\" mode that filters out these false-positives. The introduced cryptography routines (siphash for generic data) and helpers (BIP158 ranged hash calculation, relevant scriptPubKey per block determination) could potentially also be useful for more tests in the future that involve compact block filters.",
