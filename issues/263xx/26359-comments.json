(And maybe in a separate pull request, as it would change non-erlay code?) This would mean that the tx relay struct isn't initialized and also m_relays_txs isn't set, which is then checked in this line here.\r\n* Unrelated, I wonder if `RejectIncomingTxs` should be used here. The difference is that the `Relay` permission will be carved out. I don't know the answer, I just wanted to raise the point.",
