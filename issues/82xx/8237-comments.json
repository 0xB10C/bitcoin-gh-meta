What dependencies people use when building themselves is outside of the project's scope, except for minimum dependencies, which is currently Qt 4.8. While it will hopefully make sense to bump the minimum Qt dep \"soon\"\\*, I doubt 5.7 will be practical for a while: Debian stable is at 5.3.\r\n\r\n\\* Uhh, unless I'm mistaken, does RHEL really not have *any* Qt5 yet? :(",
