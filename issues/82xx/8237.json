   "body" : "Opening an issue to track potential QT5.7 improvements, so that comments don't get lost on closed PRs.\r\n\r\nQT 5.7 has been [released](https://blog.qt.io/blog/2016/06/16/qt-5-7-released/).\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarting with Qt 5.7, we will require a C++11 compliant compiler to build and use Qt. \r\nThis allows us to use many of the new features in Qt itself, and renew our codebase \r\nusing features such as constexpr, move semantics, range-for and auto. These efforts \r\nare well under way and will continue throughout the next versions.\r\n\r\n#### Qt Core\r\n- Qt uses poll() instead of select() in itÃ¢ÂÂs event loop allowing for more than 1024 file \r\ndescriptors\r\n- Qt now uses std::atomic for itÃ¢ÂÂs atomic classes\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8053#issuecomment-226714893\r\n```\r\nThough it's worth noting for a future pr: 5.7 improves a few build-related\r\nthings for us:\r\n- allows for split native tools build.\r\n- passes flags (like -D and -B only to the host toolchain)\r\n\r\n(I'm on mobile so those are from memory, may not be 100% accurate. I also\r\nhaven't tested that those work as intended.)\r\n\r\nThe first should allow us to split up the build into more reasonable chunks\r\n(native_qttools and qtlibs).\r\n\r\nThe second should allow us to drop the xcb patch in favor of using more\r\ndetailed flags. It should also allow us to drop the hackish env vars we use.\r\n```",
