Result would be those txids being added to recentRejects, messing up propagation.\r\n\r\nThat said, I haven't actually tested this yet; about to go off to a conference, so if someone else wants to confirm for me that'd be much appreciated! Or if I'm wrong you're welcome to all laugh at my expense. :)\r\n\r\nCC: @sdaftuar @sipa \r\n",
