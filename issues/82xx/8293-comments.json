A few nits:\r\n- Please store the test as build_no_programs or build_libs_only or so, so that we only need the ugly xnononono stuff in one place.\r\n- I'd rather not abuse system_univalue that way, as it's not obvious what it's doing. Please change that to configure_embedded_univalue or so, and rework the test as necessary.",
