[Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Features.html) is a transactional package manager much like Nix, but unlike Nix, it has more of a focus on [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html) and [reproducibility](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/tags/reproducible-builds/) which are attractive for security-sensitive projects like bitcoin.\r\n\r\n### Guix Build Walkthrough\r\n\r\n[Fresh content](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-471658439)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Old content</summary>\r\nIn this PR, we define a Guix [manifest](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-package.html#profile_002dmanifest) in `contrib/guix/manifest.scm`, which declares what packages we want in our environment.\r\n\r\nWe can then invoke\r\n```\r\nguix environment --manifest=contrib/guix/manifest.scm --container --pure --no-grafts --no-substitutes\r\n```\r\nTo have Guix:\r\n1. Build an environment containing the packages we defined in our `contrib/guix/manifest.scm` manifest from the Guix bootstrap binaries (see [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html) for more details).\r\n2. Start a container with that environment that has no network access, and no access to the host's filesystem except to the `pwd` that it was started in.\r\n3. Drop you into a shell in that container.\r\n\r\n> Note: if you don't want to wait hours for Guix to build the entire world from scratch, you can eliminate the `--no-substitutes` option to have Guix download from available binary sources. Note that this convenience doesn't necessarily compromise your security, as you can check that a package was built correctly after the fact using `guix build --check <packagename>`\r\n\r\nTherefore, we can perform a build of bitcoin much like in Gitian by invoking the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake -C depends -j\"$(nproc)\" download && \\\r\n    cat contrib/guix/build.sh | guix environment --manifest=contrib/guix/manifest.scm --container --pure --no-grafts --no-substitutes\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe don't include `make -C depends -j\"$(nproc)\" download` inside `contrib/guix/build.sh` because `contrib/guix/build.sh` is run inside the container, which has no network access (which is a good thing).\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI believe that this represents a substantial improvement for the \"supply chain security\" of bitcoin because:\r\n\r\n1. We no longer have to rely on Ubuntu for our build environment for our releases ([oh the horror](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/72bd4ab867e3be0d8410403d9641c08288d343e3/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml#L10)), because Guix builds everything about the container, we can perform this on almost any Linux distro/system.\r\n2. It is now much easier to determine what trusted binaries are in our supply chain, and even make a nice visualization! (see [bootstrappability](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Bootstrapping.html)).\r\n3. There is active effort among Guix folks to minimize the number of trusted binaries even further. OriansJ's [stage0](https://github.com/oriansj/stage0), and janneke's [Mes](https://www.gnu.org/software/mes/) all aim to achieve [reduced binary boostrap](http://joyofsource.com/reduced-binary-seed-bootstrap.html) for Guix. In fact, I believe if OriansJ gets his way, we will end up some day with only a single trusted binary: hex0 (a ~500 byte self-hosting hex assembler).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Completion\r\n\r\n- [x] Successfully build bitcoin inside the Guix environment\r\n- [x] Make `check-symbols` pass\r\n- [ ] Do the above but without nasty hacks (**HELP WANTED HERE**)\r\n- [ ] Document build process for future releases\r\n- [ ] Extra: Pin the revision of Guix that we build with with Guix [inferiors](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Inferiors.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Help Wanted\r\n\r\n[Fresh content](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15277#issuecomment-471658439)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Old content</summary>\r\nAs of now, the command described above to perform a build of bitcoin a lot like Gitian works, but fails at the `check-symbols` stage. This is because a few dynamic libraries are linked in that shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nHere's what `ldd src/bitcoind` looks like when built in a Guix container:\r\n```\r\n\tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcc2d90000)\r\n\tlibdl.so.2 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fb7eda09000)\r\n\tlibrt.so.1 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007fb7ed9ff000)\r\n\tlibstdc++.so.6 => /gnu/store/4sqps8dczv3g7rwbdibfz6rf5jlk7w90-gcc-5.5.0-lib/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fb7ed87c000)\r\n\tlibpthread.so.0 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fb7ed85b000)\r\n\tlibm.so.6 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007fb7ed6da000)\r\n\tlibgcc_s.so.1 => /gnu/store/4sqps8dczv3g7rwbdibfz6rf5jlk7w90-gcc-5.5.0-lib/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fb7ed6bf000)\r\n\tlibc.so.6 => /gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb7ed506000)\r\n\t/gnu/store/h90vnqw0nwd0hhm1l5dgxsdrigddfmq4-glibc-2.28/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb7ee3a0000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's what it looks in one of our releases:\r\n```\r\n\tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffff52cd000)\r\n\tlibpthread.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f87726b4000)\r\n\tlibrt.so.1 => /usr/lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007f87726aa000)\r\n\tlibm.so.6 => /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007f8772525000)\r\n\tlibgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f877250b000)\r\n\tlibc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f8772347000)\r\n\t/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f8773392000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~I suspect it is because my script does not apply the gitian-input patches [described in the release process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md#fetch-and-create-inputs-first-time-or-when-dependency-versions-change) but there is no description as to how these patches are applied.~~ It might also be something else entirely.\r\n\r\nEdit: It is something else. It appears that the gitian inputs are only used by [`gitian-win-signer.yml`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d6e700e40f861ddd6743f4d13f0d6f6bc19093c2/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml#L14)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### How to Help\r\n\r\n1. Install Guix on your distro either [from source](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Requirements.html) or perform a [binary installation](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html#Binary-Installation)\r\n2.
