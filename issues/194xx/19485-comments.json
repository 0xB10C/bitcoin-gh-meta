I use for myself a patch i made fro myself to tunnel V3 in V2 ADDR message that works right now with current master.\r\nIt uses FC00/7 address that we ignore and resembles on the end to a v3 address to drop in and out from the peers.dat,\r\nThat should not even need a BIP since its fully transparent to the actual implementation, although a bit ugly and stealth. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
