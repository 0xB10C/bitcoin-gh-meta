   "body" : "This adds the ability to have any number of internal or external locks to prevent pruning specific block ranges.\r\n\r\nSome examples where this would be useful:\r\n\r\n* Ensuring any known Core wallet won't become unable to sync due to pruning when it is unloaded. (Included in this PR)\r\n* Ensuring pruning doesn't go too far for a desired-functional wallet backup. (Questionable, since you probably lose the node if you need the backup anyway?)\r\n* Allowing users to temporarily disable block indexes and filters, without pruning cutting them off from catching up later.\r\n* Avoiding pruning out from under external wallets (Armory, EPS, etc) that might need block data.\r\n* External block indexes/filters, etc.\r\n\r\nBy design, users retain complete control over prune locks, and can delete them out from under applications using them. This is to avoid circumstances where a prune lock has been set, by an application that may no longer be used.\r\n\r\nOne caveat in this PR is that it exposes the BDB \"fileid\" to wallet logic. This is to ensure the same prune lock is used/updated even if the wallet is moved or renamed later. It might seem ugly at face value to do it this way, but I'm not sure we have any other unique identifier, and it should be trivial for any new db backend to simply migrate the fileid to a dedicated key.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n* Tests\r\n* Check endian safety of BDB fileid\r\n* GUI management of prune locks (followup PR?)\r\n* Ability to enable for wallets from the GUI (followup PR?)\r\n",
