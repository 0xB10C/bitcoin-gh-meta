However, it can still be run by bypassing the security layer of Apple.\r\n\r\nIt is signed but not notarized for privacy reasons (background infos #18187).\r\nRight click and \"open...\" should allow you to start the app without issues.\r\nMost (all?) contributors where in favour of that solution versus sacrificing privacy.\r\n\r\n> 2 - When I launch it the first time it asks me to select a directory. This directory also will host the 300gigs for the block, so I created a BTC volume on the NAS (don't have that space available on the Mac mini) so I can save the ledger in its own dedicated space and it's here that I experience issues\r\n\r\n**NAS are not supported.**. Bitcoin Core should be run with a fast and direct disk access.",
