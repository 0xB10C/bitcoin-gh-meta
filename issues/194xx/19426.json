This is problematic for several reasons:\r\n\r\n* It would be undefined behaviour to pass in a nullptr because for signature creation, the memory of the mutable transaction is accessed\r\n* No caller currently passes in a nullptr, so passing a reference as a pointer is confusing\r\n\r\nFix all issues by replacing `*` with `&` in `MutableTransactionSignatureCreator`",
