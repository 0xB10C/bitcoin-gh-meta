   "body" : "It is a work in progress, I manage to remove the CBlockIndex dependency from consensus block by adding two new types: **CConsensusFlags** and **CConsensusContextualInfo** (last block, last block mtp, now, last block height). Both of them can be trivial calculated in main() with **pIndex**, then passed to consensus method.\r\nThe code change is minimal and easy to review.\r\n\r\nBlockVerify/TransactionVerify will require the user to pass the **CConsensusFlags** as well **CConsensusContextualInfo**.\r\n\r\nA GetFlags method without too much code is difficult as it relies heavily on **CBlockIndex**. It is also fairly easy enough to port into other languages.\r\nAs such it is considered out of scope of this PR.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, @jtimon is also working on https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commits/jt .",
