   "body" : "These commits revise the layout of a few key classes to eliminate padding, eliminating useless memory overhead.\r\n\r\nCTxMemPoolEntry is decreased to 184 bytes from 192. CTransaction is decreased to 112 bytes from 120.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is clarified in CTxMempoolEntry where the extra space is (2 bytes) for future overhead-free use.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of CTxMemPoolEntryFlags is used to bit-pack the bool flags, making room for 6 more future-flags. I have not performance tested this, but it should not be much. It does not save any space at the moment due to padding, but if more bools are added it would compared to naive.\r\n\r\nTo finish this work, the following should be done: profiling of access patterns to class fields to guarantee cache-line co-residency, cross architecture padding optimizations.\r\n\r\n",
