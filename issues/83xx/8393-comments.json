If we intend to require a certain ordering of sendcmpct announcements, I think that should be more clearly called out in the BIP (I'll leave a separate comment in bitcoin/bips#423 to indicate the language I suggest improving).  But my initial reaction is that we shouldn't impose this constraint.\r\n\r\nAnyway I'm a bit confused on the interaction here between NODE_WITNESS and how we process sendcmpct messages.  Per BIP 152, if we don't support version 2 compact blocks, we must ignore version 2 sendcmpct messages.  But this code doesn't appear to be written this way (ie this processes version 2 sendcmpct messages, even if NODE_WITNESS is off).\r\n\r\nIn particular, it seems that this code could break if eg it was part of a release (like 0.13.0)  where NODE_WITNESS would not be set, but at some point in the future it had a peer that supported only version 2 compact blocks (as we'd process the version 2 message and think we could communicate with the peer, even though we can't).\r\n",
