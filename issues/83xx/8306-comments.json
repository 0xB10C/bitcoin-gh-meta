      "body" : "I observed a testnet node persistently stuck (even across restarts) in a case where its best header chain was invalid and the public network has a best valid chain with much more work than the invalid best header chain that I have, but it took more than one headers message to connect it.\r\n\r\nSuhas identified this PR as the probable cause, and on revert the node immediately became unstuck. Considering how near we are to release, I think simply reverting this is the right action currently. The issue it was fixing should have been rare and largely inconsequential on the Bitcoin network.",
