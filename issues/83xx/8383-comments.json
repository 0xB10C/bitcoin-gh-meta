      "body" : "Thanks @dooglus for reporting.\r\nI just double-checked and right Ã¢ÂÂÃÂ as you have edited Ã¢ÂÂ the keypool gets discarded once you encrypt the wallet.\r\n\r\nBut you are right. The seed key will be kept which can be problematic.\r\nGenerating a new seed once the user encrypt could be a solution, though I think it could be unexpected from the user perspective (it would invalidate his old backup probably done before he encrypted the wallet).\r\n\r\nOther solutions? Add a boolean parameter to encryptwallet to force regeneration of the seed?\r\n\r\nMaybe another solution would be to allow a startup argument -encryptwallet=<password> which would directly encrypt wallets during the phase of creation. It could also encrypt already existing wallets.",
