How to deal with this kind of issues in the bitcoin core app? Is there any way to cancel unconfirmed transactions, edit, double spend or mine it by myself, anything that could help me to restore the control of my bitcoins? Is there any expiration time or my zombie coins can hang forever in the network? btw, I created this tx one month ago but receiving time from the network is fresh: https://www.localbitcoinschain.com/tx/33cfd21d6003acb420be90e6692e7bb75b6fc86e54ff0c97dc429afba64645e5 wtf? The bitcoin core automatically rebroadcast it or what?\r\n\r\n![btcmain](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20534833/16947294/94e4a426-4dae-11e6-8722-94bf47301beb.jpg)\r\n![tx](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20534833/16945960/aa429230-4da7-11e6-9eaf-97d097647f22.jpg)\r\n",
