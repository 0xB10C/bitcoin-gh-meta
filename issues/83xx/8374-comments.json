Are you ok with just removing the language about discouraging/encouraging how people use these options, and simply state their existence?\r\n\r\nThen we can see what effect the changes in the 0.13 release have on the network, and reassess whether any recommendations are needed in the first release that actually does a block size increase (through segwit)?",
