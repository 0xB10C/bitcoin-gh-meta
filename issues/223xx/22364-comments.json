Given that it's still marked experimental, having some manual RPC / wallet tool command would be fine I think. But with future soft-forks such an upgrade should be automatically, just like how we added Segwit addresses to existing wallets.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried getting the master HD key to derive some new private keys in #22341 I got thoroughly confused. It might make more sense to store the seed in the main wallet payload rather than in each SPKman.",
