They may be more likely to use a search engine to look for a blog post or article, and writing/hosting a good article seems like a good contribution. Of course, that is only speculation on my part.)",

(Definitely 1,2, and 4 under `Why`, maybe not 3).\r\n\r\nRe: `How` - I think this will be hard to process without seeing all 3 OS examples at one time, as seeing just the linux example looked like duplication.  Even with all 3, maybe we will want to remove the general installation instruction as we are adding specific instructions later in the document (or will the installation instructions come first? - See point 3 under `Why`)\r\n\r\nI agree with @jonatack That screenshots shouldn't be used - they don't work perfectly for each user, and they make the document too long IMO.  As for his second point, hopefully tutorials start to point official docs.\r\n",
