That can't happen until some time after bitcoind has forked into the background. The `-startupnotify` option was added in 090530cc24 (#15367) to support exactly this use case, so let's use it.\r\n\r\nA straightforward and reliable way to wait for bitcoind to invoke its `-startupnotify` command is to make bitcoind hold a lock on a dummy file and release that lock via the `-startupnotify` command. The initscript's `start_post()` function initially marks the service as inactive and forks a subshell process into the background to wait for bitcoind to release the lock file, which will happen when bitcoind either executes the `-startupnotify` command or dies. After acquiring and releasing the lock, the subshell checks whether the pid file still exists and marks the service as started or stopped appropriately.",
