Earlier PR had a bigger scope with title as \"Improve Tor docs\", was difficult to add every suggestion and made no sense in keeping basic doc improvements pending for months.\r\n3. Few reviewers had issues with the \"examples\" part and \"DNS requests\" thing in previous PR. Keeping things separate and specific to one type of changes in a PR should help.\r\n4. Lot of comments in previous PR.
