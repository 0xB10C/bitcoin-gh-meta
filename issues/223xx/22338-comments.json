      "body" : "> This change is not really necessary as MAX_OPCODE check is only really\r\nused while decoding transactions\r\n\r\nTo elaborate, right now this is used while parsing scrpitPubkey and ScrpitSig in a Tx. It is impossible for `CHECKSIGADD` to end up in `scriptSig` or `scriptPubkey` in taproot. Secondly, the opcode execution is only valid for taproot scripts, but according to the current design, the functions checking validity of scripts don't have access to appropriate scriptContext.\r\n\r\nSo, the ideal solution would be to somehow pass the script context and enforce that the `CHECKSIGADD` is only used in tapscripts, but that probably requires more discussion and is out of scope for this PR.",
