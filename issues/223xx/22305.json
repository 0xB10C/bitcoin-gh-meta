It\r\n  is added to fix some Linux Open File Description (OFD) locks usage on non\r\n  LFS mode.  As for others *64 functions, `fcntl64` semantics are analogous with\r\n  `fcntl` and LFS support is handled transparently.  Also for Linux, the OFD\r\n  locks act as a cancellation entrypoint.\r\n\r\nFrom SQLite [docs](https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html#_options_to_disable_features_normally_turned_on):\r\n> `SQLITE_DISABLE_LFS`\r\n>\r\n>    If this C-preprocessor macro is defined, large file support is disabled.\r\n\r\nDue to peculiarities in glibc Large File Support implementation for 32-bit systems it looks safer to bump the minimum libc version to 2.28 for them.\r\n\r\nCould be reverted back after bumping minimum glibc version to 2.28+.",
