      "body" : "I would encourage more use of `std::logic_error` instead of asserts. I see logic errors and asserts as semantically equivalent, both indicating the presence of bugs, but logic_errors working better with unit tests. I think the suggested macro could be a good idea, because `if (cond) throw std::logic_error(strprintf(...))` is pretty verbose, and I think that discourages use. (Grepping for logic_error` I think every existing logic_error throw actually comes from me and no one other bitcoin developer has written one.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think it would be a good idea to ever catch `std::logic_error` outside of unit tests. I think that defeats the major advantage of logic_errors as logical assertions compatible with having good test coverage.\r\n\r\nIf the goal here is better isolation from nonfatal bugs in RPCs, I think I'd suggest instead defining a new `NonfatalError` class inheriting from `std::exception`, a `CHECK_NONFATAL` or similar macro throwing nonfatal error exceptions, and code to catch and handle those exceptions somewhere in the RPC framework.",
