That would make it harder to run a bandwidth efficient non-addr-relay node (e.g. an \"SPV node\"). I think that addr messages should only be gossiped to bip-155 nodes or network nodes (detectable via service bit). All other nodes should send a `getaddr` or `getaddrv2` p2p message to solicit addresses.",
