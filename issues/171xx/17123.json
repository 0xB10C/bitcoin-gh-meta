   "body" : "I noticed while trying to deploy for all platforms on Qt 5.12.4 that as of that version only openssl vesrion 1.1.1+ is supported. This prompted me to check what version is used currently in this project (1.0.1k) and to also check the EOL. \r\n\r\nI found that 1.0.1 version reached EOL in 2016. 1.0.2 reaches EOL in december 2019 so I wanted to know if there is a reason the default is not  1.1.1 ? This also probably supports our efforts to encourage a bump from QT 5.9 to 5.12.4/5. I think a comprehensive look across all platforms should be considered. ",
