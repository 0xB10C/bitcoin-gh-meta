   "body" : "fixes #17117\r\n\r\nI understood the bug as the help string being wrong, rather than that this feature is missing and should be added. Let me know if it should be the other way around.\r\n\r\nIt is notable that if 0 is given as an argument, the fallback that is being used is the libevent default of 50 seconds, rather than `DEFAULT_HTTP_CLIENT_TIMEOUT` (900 seconds). This is not intuitive for the user. I could handle this in this PR but I am unsure which would be the better solution then: Actually adding the feature as described in the help string or falling back to `DEFAULT_HTTP_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`? Happy to hear opinions.",
