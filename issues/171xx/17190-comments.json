I think they were going to just assume that the 0 path is receive, and 1 is change.\r\n\r\nHmm, what do you expect the semantics to be? Do you literally treat the \"xpub...{0,1}/*\" descriptor as a list of two descriptors, which the layer above needs to deal with? Or do you treat it as a single descriptor which expands to a merging of those two descriptors (e.g. by expanding even indices i as index i/2 of the first one, and odd ones i as index (i-1)/2 of the second one)?\r\n\r\nIf you treat them as two descriptors, arguably you're not extending the descriptor syntax, but instead building a language on top that describes lists of descriptors - something that perhaps won't (or even shouldn't) work in all places descriptors are accepted.\r\n\r\nIf you treat them as a single merged descriptor, the layer above can't see which ones are from 0/* and which ones are from 1/*, and shouldn't treat them non-homogeneously.",
