I've also just tested with *all* configuration settings in bitcoin.conf commented out except for disablewallet=1, and it's still doing repeated not responding when clicking through the GUI. It seems like it reproducibly starts to happen once it connects to peers. This should rule out any special settings other than disablewallet.\r\n\r\n> As a side note, this is a common cause of chainstate corruption.\r\n\r\nYeah, I know it's not recommended. To keep it as safe as possible I make regular blockchain backups, never disconnect the drive or touch the USB cord while the machine is running, the external drive is a dual drive RAID1 enclosure, and everything is connected to a UPS. It sits in a closet on a shelf out of the way. I don't have another machine that's convenient to dedicate to it. I've been running it like this for almost three years, and haven't run into any chainstate corruption that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\n> The cause might be slow disk access, but it might be good to confirm.\r\n\r\nI just did a drive speed test, getting 72 MB/s average read, 66 MB/s average write. Keep in mind, the problem isn't happening on 0.18.1, with the same hardware.\r\n\r\n> Could you check the debug.log when this happens? \r\n\r\nI don't see anything obvious. I'm getting warnings about '50 of last 100 blocks have unexpected version', but that is happening in both 0.18.1 (where the not responding isn't happening) and 0.19.0rc1.
