   "body" : "`CommitTransaction()` returns a bool to indicate success, but since commit\r\nb3a7410 (#9302) it only returns true, even if the transaction was not\r\nsuccessfully broadcast. This PR fixes `CommitTransaction()` to return\r\nwhether or not the transaction broadcast was successful.\r\n\r\nA couple of call sites are updated to maintain existing behavior (ie to return the txid in send RPC methods even when we failed to broadcast the transaction). The only place that this should change behaviour is in QT, which is now made aware of the fact that the transaction was not successfully broadcast through the `commitTransaction` Wallet interface method.\r\n\r\nTwo additional commits fix up the idiosyncratic whitespace in `CommitTransaction` and add a doxygen comment for the function.",
