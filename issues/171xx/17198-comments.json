      "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nI created a list from the output of @practicalswift 's command and am now going it through one by one. It's also a good way to learn Bitcoin's APIs. ;)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nsrc/util/threadnames.cpp:const std::string& util::ThreadGetInternalName() { return g_thread_name; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've checked its references throughout the code and it seems that this string reference never does anything with the data it owns. So, why not converting it into a **string_view**, that is: **boost::string_view**, because currently no C++17 support in Bitcoin, if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's the **Logger** class [that deals with strings](https://github.com/brakmic/bitcoin/blob/master/src/logging.cpp#L267).\r\n\r\nAnd this is where I had to stop, because I didn't want to change Logger itself. All other parts of the code where **ThreadGetInternalName()** was used could be changed to string_view without any interference. So, maybe I should have tried to change Logger, because it would make sense for a Logger to never own any data. Would it make sense? I don't know, only speculating.\r\n\r\nI am not saying, that this should be done (the *string_view*, I mean), or that it even makes sense, but in general, when something doesn't do anything with data it points to, then it should not own it. Also, *string_view*s can be passed by value without any performance hit, while references always have a redirection in them.\r\n\r\nLet's see what other functions have to offer. :)\r\n\r\nRegards,",
