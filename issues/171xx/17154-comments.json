What is this needed for?\r\n\r\nCurrently the function returns a bool, which is always `true`, but the callers have logic that depends on the return value.\r\n\r\n`CommitTransaction()` did previously return `true`/`false` based on success. That was removed in #9302 so that the `send___` RPC methods would return the txid even if the transaction failed to broadcast. That's useful because the transaction will still exist in the wallet, so the RPC user would want to know about it. The fix should have been to have the call sites ignore the return value of `CommitTransaction()`, but instead the PR changed the function itself to not return success/failure, meaning that as a side effect `WalletModel::sendCoins()` is no longer informed if transaction broadcast fails. From reading the PR, it looks to me like that change was unintentional.\r\n\r\nI could change this PR to maintain the current behaviour (not return success to `WalletModel::sendCoins()`). Do you think that's preferable?",
