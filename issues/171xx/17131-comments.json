      "body" : "Unfortunately, there is nothing on this in the docs and due to this [issue of libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/issues/87) I guess they were not aware of this behavior either. This code is now changed in master but not in any release, [here it is in the code of 2.1.11 which is the latest stable release](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/blob/4c908dde58ef780eeefcc9df4db3063ca62ea862/http.c#L1625). If I understand the code correctly the timeout values are always initialized as 0 and then overridden with the defaults if they are still 0 at the end, so setting them explicitly to 0 does nothing. Since nothing has happened to their issue it seems there is actually no way to set no timeout on libevent right now.\r\n\r\nI don't see a simple way to make long-running connections work so I would suggest merging the fixed help text and then thinking about how we could add it. But maybe we set the timeout to our default (900) if 0 is passed? Also not ideal but makes a little more sense than the 'magic' 50 seconds. \r\n\r\n> According to [#9903 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9903#issuecomment-283937055) it used to work at some point\r\n\r\nHm, I am really not sure what happened there. [Our code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/90a1d9a55d81029deb482888a9ddaa364f4a2c73/src/bitcoin-cli.cpp#L200) hasn't changed and I don't see how libevent could have behaved differently either.",
