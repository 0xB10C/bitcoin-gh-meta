   "body" : "This is a simpler alternative to #10830 which removes the block sync pause logic. All this PR does is:\r\n\r\n- if a key in the keypool is used, mark all keys up to that key in the keypool as used\r\n- if the number of keys in the keypool drops below a configurable minimum and we can't top up (because the wallet is encrypted), shutdown the node.\r\n\r\nThis has required a lot of rebasing (multiwallet, internal/external keypool, ...), and the test is currently failing. I'm working on fixing it, but I would appreciate some technical code review since I'm not an expert on wallet code.",
