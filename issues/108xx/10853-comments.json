Hopefully changing it to `assert_raises_rpc_error()` will mean people notice the function and use it instead of `assert_raises_message()` or try to roll their own.\r\n- with `--usecli` (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10798), I'm adding a new mode to the test framework, where RPCs are sent via `bitcoin-cli` rather than using JSON over HTTP. In that context, `assert_raises_rpc_error()` makes more sense.\r\n\r\nIt's a scripted diff changing one function name, so rebasing shouldn't be too difficult.",
