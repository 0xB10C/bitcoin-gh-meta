      "body" : "@eklitzke Thanks for your contribution! I think your patch is pretty much acceptable as-is. Since the (new) `fRequestShutdown` is static and very localized, I would argue to convert it to a non-atomic in one go.\r\n\r\nAs you're pretty much rewriting all uses of these variables anyway, I think you could adapt them to the new coding style guidelines too (e.g. `g_cs_shutdown`, `g_shutdown_condition`, `g_request_shutdown`). That's just a suggestion, not a requirement.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK\r\n\r\nAlso note that we're currently in the process of freezing for 0.15, merging this may be delayed a bit.",
