Will endpoint be considered experimental (unchanging semantics but possibly temporary) or unstable (possibly changing semantics and possibly temporary)?\r\n\r\nAlso, from the other issue I think something like `-rpcwallet=filename` would be better than `-usewallet=filename`.

Let's not repeat this: JSON-RPC uses POST only, and with POST it is weird to have `?a=b` URL-encoded arguments in the URL as well. It also implies more arguments could be added later, which is not true. This is only to select the wallet, which is inherently hierarchical.\r\n(also e.g. ?a=b syntax isn't deterministic, it's possible to add arguments that are ignored, change the order of the arguments, etc, whereas a /wallet/&lt;name&gt;/ URL is simply a fixed thing)",
