This is the case for nearly every x86_64 CPU out there.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid build dependencies and other complications, the original Intel YASM code was translated to GCC extended asm syntax.\r\n\r\nThis gives around a 50% speedup on the SHA256 benchmark for me.\r\n\r\nIt is based on an earlier patch by @laanwj, though only includes a single assembly version (for now), and removes the YASM dependency.",
