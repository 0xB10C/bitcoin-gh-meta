Enables crc32 if cflags/cxxflags are overridden but the intrinsics still work.\r\n\r\nI think 2 is what you're asking about? If so, it wouldn't work before because, even though the user has specified -msse4.2 (or -march=native, or whatever it takes to get the intrinsics working), our build wouldn't have the necessary make option set here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/Makefile.leveldb.include#L145, so the necessary define wouldn't be added.",
