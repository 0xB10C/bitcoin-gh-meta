It should have it as the errors pertain to the blockchain. This PR adds that field.\r\n\r\nThis PR also unifies the help text for the `errors` field and its output position so that all of the `get*info` commands are consistent.\r\n\r\n`getnetworkinfo`'s `errors` field is named `warnings`. I did not change this even though it is inconsistent since this naming has been in use for a long time.",
