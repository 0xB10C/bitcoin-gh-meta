I'm not a fan of these statistical RPCs, which seem to me to be very interesting, but really only provide niche functionality. My issue is that they add maintenance burden for features that are only likely to be used by very few people. For me, they're better served by a fork of the project or a patch set. To my mind, this project should try to minimize functionality to what's essential for end users.\r\n\r\nI understand that I may be in the minority in that view, and that it's probably discouraging for contributors for proposed PRs to be rejected, so I'm not going to push the point.",
