   "body" : "This is #10240 rebased on master, with some of the comments addressed. I've tidied the code up to current style (braces, variable names, etc) and also squashed/split/re-arranged the commits to help reviewers.\r\n\r\nNot ready for merge yet, but I'm happy to receive early feedback.\r\n\r\nUnaddressed feedback from #10240:\r\n\r\n- [ ] make this work with multiwallet. Perhaps use a counter instead of a bool for pausing block requests/tip udpates.\r\n- [ ] Increase the size of the keypool\r\n- [ ] enable keypool restore for non-HD wallets.\r\n\r\nThanks to @jonasschnelli for his work on #10240. Paging @ryanofsky @gmaxwell @sipa since they provided feedback on 10240.",
