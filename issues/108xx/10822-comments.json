This is just RPC anyway.\r\nI also think making -txindex more useful may increase the incentives to run an archive full node.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning (with some errors corrected below it) is here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9806#issuecomment-313578569\r\n\r\n> This functionality is already available through getrawtransaction anyway.\r\n\r\nBy that logic, shouldn't we just fully remove gettxout?\r\nThat would be bad for gettxoutbyscript and gettxoutbyaddress though, I think.\r\n\r\ngettxout is faster for utxo, so if one wants a txo (not knowing if stxo/utxo a priori), one could call gettxout first and only if it fails call getrawtransation. But I think a single call would be more convenient.\r\nIf not, I guess we need getoutpointfromscript and getoupointfrom address call too to serve the full txo.\r\nOne could, for example, call gettxoutbyaddress and if it fails, also call gettxoutbyaddress and getrawtransaction. It would be more cumbersome, but it would also work.\r\n",
