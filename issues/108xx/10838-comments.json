      "body" : "NACK for 0.15\r\n\r\nAlthough `getinfo` has been known among Bitcoin Core developers as being deprecated for a long time, it was only documented and marked as deprecated in 0.14. Furthermore, a large number of projects which use the RPC commands rely on `getinfo` to make sure that the RPC server is available. Thus removing `getinfo` now would break a lot of things. I think that before we remove `getinfo`, we need to inform projects that use `getinfo` that it will be removed and that they need to change to using a different RPC command.",
