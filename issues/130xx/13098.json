   "body" : "When serving historic blocks, there is no need to calculate the hash of each transaction, so just skip it.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly refactoring with the following changes:\r\n* Introduce a `CPureTransaction`, a stripped down version of `CTransaction` (no `hash` or `GetHash()` members). Then derive `class CTransaction` from `CPureTransaction`\r\n* Deduce a `CPureBlock` which references `CPureTransactions` in its `vtx`.\r\n\r\nDeserialization now only takes 14% of the wall clock time it took previously on my machine. You can check locally with:\r\n```\r\n./bench_bitcoin --filter=DeserializeBlockTest && ./bench_bitcoin --filter=DeserializePureBlockTest\r\n```\r\nSending a single historic block now takes slightly less (90% of the wall clock time it took previously) on a local network. I presume the speedup is more pronounced when sending more than one block.",
