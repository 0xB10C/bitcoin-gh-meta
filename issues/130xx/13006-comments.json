What we mostly care in functional tests is the behaviour (on the rpc and p2p interface) not so much the by-products that end up in the debug.log. One exception is where the rpc or p2p interface don't provide sufficient information to be sure the behaviour happened for the right reason.\r\n\r\nIt seems asserting regex on the debug log can be done, but in almost all cases it would be orthogonal or rather in addition to existing test patterns. That is because a string logged to a text file does not imply the thing actually happened in the test. So if you expected, let's say a disconnect, you could wait until you observe that disconnect in the debug log and then (in addition) wait until you observe the disconnect in the network. Rather, it could make more sense to only wait for the disconnect happening in the network and then go read the debug log of the node that initiated the disconnect and assert on the reason for the disconnect, since those are usually not communicated via existing interfaces.\r\n\r\nIt seems that is what your example use case is doing, so Concept ACK on that, but Concept NACK on other use cases.",
