   "body" : "Adds an \"address_type\" parameter that accepts \"legacy\", \"p2sh-segwit\", and \"bech32\" to choose the type of address created. Defaults to \"legacy\" rather than the value of the `-address-type` option for backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nAs part of implementing this, OutputType is moved from wallet into its own module, and `AddAndGetDestinationForScript` is changed to apply to a `CKeyStore` rather than a wallet, and to invoke `keystore.AddCScript(script)` itself rather than expecting the caller to have done that.",
