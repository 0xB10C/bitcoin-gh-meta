      "body" : "> @ryanofsky care to review?\r\n\r\nChange seems harmless but I don't understand why it makes sense. Is it part of a larger set of changes that I can look at or part of a larger design that you can describe somewhere?\r\n\r\nThe map doesn't seem to make sense for unloading because wallet interfaces are created on the fly and you can't identify them by pointer. Maybe the map is supposed to be keyed by wallet name? The list of handlers doesn't seem to make sense because there is only one handler. I also think it would probably be better and less duplicative if splashscreen were not managing any interface pointers at all, but just creating a slot which wallets  in `m_wallet_models` could send signals to.",
