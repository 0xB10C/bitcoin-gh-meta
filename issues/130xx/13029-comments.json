It might be more elegant to split the `ParameterInteraction` methods into before and after databases have been loaded. That might also help to avoid various remaining instances of `gArgs.GetArg(\"-prune\"`.",

Guessing values for options according to context has the drawback that the system becomes less transparent, harder to troubleshoot. \r\n\r\nAlso it's good to avoid `IsArgSet` as much as possible as it's not possible to re-set an argument back to unset state, even by clearing it.\r\n\r\nIt also seems a large code change for what feels like a small argument handling change.\r\n\r\nAnd if we do this, should we do the same for txindex?\r\n",
