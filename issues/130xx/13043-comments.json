There doesn't seem to be any consistency on this screen for where to hover to see the tooltip.  I've draw highlight boxes on a screenshot approximately where hovering shows me a tooltip.  This seems like a somewhat pre-existing inconsistency only made slightly worse by this PR.  (Debian 9, QT5 used)\r\n     \r\n    ![pr13043-dialog-highlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61096/39314794-152f5a54-4943-11e8-9075-3a1efce8b55c.png)\r\n\r\n2. The message that *a restart is needed before the settings takes effect* disappears after 10-15 seconds, which seems weird (but is probably pre-existing behavior).\r\n\r\nEverything else seemed to work as expected on this previously-pruned node after restart.",

Actual disk usage may be somewhat higher.\r\n\r\n(5 extra words; 31 extra characters)",

I can press `alt+s` to tick the first checkbox. However, this is the only element in this screen which has 2 things which would need a shortcut: the text and the input box. To solve this, you could do something similar to `Connect through SOCKS5 proxy` from `Network` tab.\r\n\r\ntested on ubuntu qt5",
