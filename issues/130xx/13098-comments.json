It seems like we could achieve this more easily in other ways, like (1) just building the hash on demand the first time it's requested, or (2) adding a deserialization flag to CTransaction that instructs it to skip the hash if we're not planning to use it?\r\n\r\n[I'm not sure if (1) is a great solution, since there might be some memory-cache-benefits to building the hash at the time of deserialization, and maybe no one likes the design of having a mutable hash inside of CTransaction, but it would be a super-small diff...]",
