It's a bit vague on the \"advanced features\", because I'm assuming anyone who needs to use `-rescan` and `-txindex` will read the documentation, and a more detailed text would needlessly confuse everyone else.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"610\" alt=\"default\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10217/39052840-995c2a7c-44ad-11e8-8088-1c6da42d11f1.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe UI uses gigabytes for readability and easy of use. There is also no manual pruning UI (`prune=1`). The user will have to use `bitcoin.conf` for those things.\r\n\r\nFixes #6461. When combined with #13029 the user, after pruning their node, can safely reset settings and/or use bitcoind without having to edit `bitcoin.conf`. However I don't think that's an essential prerequisite.",
