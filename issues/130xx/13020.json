   "body" : "This replaces potential silent failures and partial logging with full logging. Seems providing at least minimal visibility to the failure is a good practice. E.g. `FlushStateToDisk` can return a rare but meaningful out of disk space error that would be better to note than leave out.\r\n\r\nNote many of these are related to `ActivateBestChain` or `FlushStateToDisk`. Only a few cases of ignored state remain, e.g. LoadExternalBlockFile and RelayWalletTransaction, where I expect logging would likely be spammy.",
