That commit updated part of the help text to refer to the first argument as `script`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            \"1. \\\"script\\\"           (string, required) The hex-encoded script (or address)\\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut not the usage summary:\r\n\r\n```\r\n             \"importaddress \\\"address\\\" ( \\\"label\\\" rescan p2sh )\\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen named arguments were introduced (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/37a166f1465c91be3e700c0175f34dd0c3698df8), the usage summary was used to name the first argument:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+    { \"wallet\",             \"importaddress\",            &importaddress,            true,   {\"address\",\"label\",\"rescan\",\"p2sh\"} },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the argument name is now part of the API, I think we should update the help text to match the argument name rather than the other way round.",
