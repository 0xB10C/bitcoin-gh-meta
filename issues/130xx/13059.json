   "body" : "This meta-issue tracks the actions required to have full wallet load/create/unload at runtime.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add locking to the global `vpwallets` to ensure no concurrency races when adding to the vector. This is sufficient thread safety for `loadwallet` and `createwallet`, but not `unloadwallet` (#13017 and #13028).\r\n- [ ] Add `loadwallet` RPC. Initially, this won't update the available wallets in the GUI (#10740)\r\n- [ ] Hook up the `loadwallet` RPC to `CClientUIInterface::LoadWallet()` so newly loaded wallets are available in the GUI (no PR yet)\r\n- [ ] Add \"load wallet\" dialog in bitcoin-qt so wallets can be loaded in the GUI (no PR yet)\r\n- [ ] Add `createwallet` RPC. Initially, this won't update the available wallets in the GUI (#13058)\r\n- [ ] Hook up the `createwallet` RPC to `CClientUIInterface::LoadWallet()` so newly created wallets are available in the GUI (no PR yet)\r\n- [ ] Add \"create wallet\" dialog in bitcoin-qt so wallets can be created in the GUI (no PR yet)\r\n- [ ] Update `vpwallets` to be shared pointers (or similar) so that wallets can be freed safely (no PR yet).\r\n- [ ] Add `unloadwallet` RPC. Initially, this won't update the available wallets in the GUI (no PR yet)\r\n- [ ] Hook up the `unloadwallet` RPC to a new `CClientUIInterface::UnloadWallet()` function so unloaded wallets are removed from the GUI (no PR yet)\r\n- [ ] Add an \"unload wallet\" command in bitcoin-qt so wallets can be unloaded in the GUI (no PR yet)\r\n\r\nI expect we should be able to do everything for load/create wallets in time for V0.17. unloadwallet may take a bit longer due to the extra difficulties around concurrency.",
