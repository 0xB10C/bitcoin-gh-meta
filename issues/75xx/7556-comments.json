      "body" : "I still disagree that storing the last sizelimit passed to CTxMemPool::TrimToSize() are the right semantics. It strikes me as hackish, unclean and not very reusable.\r\nI would prefer any of the multiple solutions I offered in #7115. But at that point none of the solutions were acceptable to you, in fact, you were strongly opposed to https://github.com/morcos/bitcoin/commit/cf95aa1225df59139c774ca98d6a24fba88a5d4f unless I was open to \"concede\" your https://github.com/morcos/bitcoin/commit/a8261aea4a67d3482893b01c6583b58048b10b95 .\r\nMay I ask what has made you change your mind about decoupling CBlockPolicyEstimator from CTxMemPool ?\r\nAt the same time, that change of opinion seems in direct contradiction with #7557.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else prefers the solution in #7115, I'm happy to rebase and reopen (or open a new one replacing it, whatever is preferred).\r\n\r\nAlso, morcos, last time we discussed, you didn't had time to collaborate with me on policy encapsulation. If that's not the case anymore, would you mind to share your thoughts on #7145 and  #6423 (based on the apparently-impossible-to-merge #6068) now?\r\n\r\nThat would probably help me understand the differences in #7557 much better.\r\n\r\n",

      "body" : "@jtimon Actually the only piece of this I care about is the first commit, storing the sizeLimit in TrimToSize and not having to pass it into GetMinFee.  In my opinion that is the design of the code:\r\n- The mempool is limited (there is no reason for that limit to be static).  \r\n- The size of that limit is set with TrimToSize. (unchanged in this PR)\r\n- GetMinFee does some calculations based on the mempool's current limit (oddly passed in from the outside before this PR)\r\n\r\nI added your two commits because I thought you wanted them and they were made easier after my commit.  I am still hesitant to think that the CBlockPolicyEstimator won't need to depend on the mempool, but as I'd said before, I'm willing to cross that bridge when we get to it.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help with your other refactor commits, but my hesitation has been not wanting to review the code without knowing that is the direction other contributors want to go.  If you could get a couple concept ACK's, I'd be happy to dive in more.  I tried to limit this and #7557 to the parts that I understand well and trusted my own opinion on direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
