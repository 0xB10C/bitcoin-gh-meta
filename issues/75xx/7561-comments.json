We already have prior versions of ism tests and in particular the p2p tests added here are testing the ISM logic for version 5 blocks already.\r\n - For BIP 68 we have the existing `bip68-sequence.py` which tests the logic of the code in a mempool only setting.  I think we need to decide whether that is sufficient when combined with a simple test that the activation logic is working in the bip68 test added here.  But for BIP 112 and 113 it seems we are still missing any tests that exercise the logic, other than the one simple case used to test activation in the rpc tests added here.\r\n - the RPC tests could have clearer names, for instance the existing bip68 rpc test is also a p2p test, so the distinction in the names is confusing, perhaps `bip68-sequence-activation.py`\r\n",
