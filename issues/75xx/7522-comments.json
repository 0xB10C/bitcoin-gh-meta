For out-of-tree builds, that's fine because share/genbuild.sh would only exist in the source, not in the build dir.\r\n\r\nHowever, this breaks for nested builds where the source is copied into a subdir, because share/genbuild.sh _does_ end up existing there. We currently build that way for Gitian and Travis because out-of-tree builds don't work. Which is why the Gitian descriptors needed to be changed.\r\n\r\nSo.. ACK, but I would very much prefer to get the out-of-tree build changes merged first, and Gitian/Travis fixed up accordingly. ",
