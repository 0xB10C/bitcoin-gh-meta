      "body" : "The math is correct, i.e. the false positive rate is once every ~ 50 years assuming an average block time of 10 min. To be clear, this is the combined (two-sided) alert rate; the one-sided alerts (pHigh or pLow) have individual rates of every ~ 100 years.\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to the original code, which from [simulation](https://gist.github.com/bitcoinfees/0f2203bdced119b98c30), gives an alert rate of ~ 3.5 years.\r\n\r\nAdditional statistics: assuming the block rate deviates from the proof-of-work target by 20% (due to changing hash rate), then pHigh / pLow will have rates of once per 3 / 8 years respectively, which seems reasonable.  If this is deemed too high, the test can be modified to allow for deviations up to a specified amount.\r\n\r\nThe other significant change here is that the test spans are made non-overlapping, and their frequency is reduced from once per 10 minutes to once per 130 minutes. This unfortunately reduces the potential statistical power (the ability to correctly detect an anomaly), and also adds latency to the alerts.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this change is that is not trivial to determine the threshold for overlapping spans. It can be done by simulation, but that's not as a good as the closed-form solution that you would get for non-overlapping spans.",
