      "body" : "We've discussed this on IRC.\r\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of adding yet another options source. The GUI already has command line, bitcoin.conf and QSettings - in that order of precedence. This has caused many complications and bugs in the past, especially during initialization, only now it seems to have cooled down a bit so I'm not really happy to stir the ants' nest again (we don't have a test suite for this part).\r\n\r\nRemember this all has to be backwards compatible. We can't just drop QSettings support. If you remember 0.5.x, the client used to store GUI settings in the wallet. It took long enough until we were able to finally drop that functionality.\r\n\r\nI'm happy that you're adding options to the GUI, but please don't couple it to this.\r\n",

For now, everything currently in QSettings remains in QSettings (although upgrading them wouldn't be very difficult or risky, it's not really an immediate goal).\r\n\r\nQSettings is not really a good solution since bitcoind won't use it (I can't think of any use case where you'd want these kind of settings different depending on whether you use Daemon vs GUI).\r\n\r\nI think I'm going to need to make this aspect of the design be take-it-or-leave-it. It seems more than reasonable to let it sit a while and get any bugs ironed out in LJR/Knots before tackling it in Core.",
