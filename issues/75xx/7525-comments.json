Keep the node/wallet code separate.\r\n2. Improve the node's performance.\r\n3. Implement SPV support for the node so it works before/while the sync goes in the background.\r\n\r\nThe first two have been improving with every release, but it takes time.

In that case the minimal HDD footprint is only 1.6 GB for /chainstate and 550 MB for /blocks as of February 2016. The cli argument `-prune=550` or setting in `bitcoin.conf` is available but the UI does not offer the less technical user a convenient way to start bitcoin-qt in that mode yet.\r\n\r\nAn easy activation of this feature on the first start combined with a new service flag for these non-archive, pruned nodes that always serve at least the last 7-14 days of blocks would still be very helpful to the network and most other nodes / SPV clients that catch up at least once every few days.",
