The mempool being full and/or spammed is not nearly as problematic thanks to a lot of improvements, and not to mention significantly more expensive to do so.  And for safety I've kept DEFAULT_ANCESTOR_SIZE_LIMIT for sanity. And two years ago it was not nearly as needed to chain chain transactions as now. I'm providing a legitimate use case for transaction chaining that was asked for in the original mailing list post.\r\n\r\nFWIW: This isn't even for me. I'm just trying to help a company send transactions in an affordable way, without going down the path of spending thousands of dollars on writing custom coin selection that avoids this limit and can manage large unspent sets properly (like I've had to do). But I strongly feel bitcoin should be trying to minimize the harmful effects of centralization that the high fees have caused. Allowing someone to fire a hundred transactions in a row without having to write extremely complex logic is a marked improvement. \r\n\r\n> A few weeks ago you were asking the that allowed unconfirmed chaining depth be made 0. :(\r\n\r\nWas that _really_ necessary? It's a clever one-liner to try undermine my credibility -- but it's a rather blatant and unfair mischaracterization. I suggested that only in the very specific case of bip125 transactions, for the express purpose of stopping the receiver making it unfeasible for you to fee bump. And as I recall you were against such limits because of their paternalistic nature. ",

The main limitation of it is that the site gives txid's that aren't on the network (a little confusing) and the transaction unfortunately has no chance of confirming next block (even though it pays enough) which is a bit unfortunate. There's also a bit of a risk that you continually outpace the network, but that can be solved by just sending in 1 minute batches or so.",
