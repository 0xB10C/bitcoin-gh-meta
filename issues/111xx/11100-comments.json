      "body" : "ACK. The current settings are reprehensible: They result in _guaranteed_ income reduction for anyone who follows them for almost no measurable benefit-- because as we see almost everyone maxes them out regardless.   The losses are also not trivial, but are often about 5% of mining income-- which wasn't the case when they were last discussed but is now.\r\n\r\nLuke's argument rests on an unlikely and now conclusively disproven theory that miners will individually act against their own short term economic best interests to preserve the usability of the network. This is demonstratively false and even if it were true, setting an economically rational default wouldn't change it. (these hypothetical altruistic miners would simply lower their defaults, if they existed)\r\n\r\nTo the limited extent that anyone does mine with these defaults (not much) they also make fee estimates less reliable by adding additional variance to the capacity of the network.  A few blocks showing up underfilled is doing no one any favors-- it doesn't meaningfully reduce the initial synchronization time. All it does is lower the revenue of those who do it.  To the extent that any of that is driven by a genuine desire to aid the network (rather than just misconfiguration)-- do we really want people who want to help to be less successful (and thus less able to add hashpower and increase their influence)\r\n\r\nSetting the defaults in a way which virtually no one will use also has the problem of causing people to change the default and then when the way the options works needs to change their outdated settings can cause unexpected behavior. For example, there are many miners who have set the max size to a million bytes to override these broken defaults. And then with segwit they'll be producing undersized blocks unintentionally.  They may even be paying enough attention to realize they need to change them, only to set them to 2 million bytes and _still_ produce undefilled blocks.\r\n\r\nSetting a reduced default against the traffic in the network today violates the principle the software should act in the interest of the people using it and in doing so shows disrespect where none is intended, it violates the principle that absent significant harm to it users it should act in the public interest (by making fee estimation less reliable). \r\n\r\nIMO if it isn't reduced it should be removed completely. At least there is a strong argument that miners producing blocks which fail to confirm all transactions is harmful to the public interest, and improvements in block propagation have largely eliminated size based considerations as legitimate reasons to choose to produce a smaller block.  (Moreover if one was for some reason still concerned about size impacts on propagation the received time sensitive framework from Suhas would be the right way to go about it, not simply reducing the maximum size.)",

That is completely different from 4 MB, and does not prove they will increase to 4 MB immediately in any sense.\r\n\r\n> Luke's argument rests on an unlikely and now conclusively disproven theory that miners will individually act against their own short term economic best interests to preserve the usability of the network. \r\n\r\nIt has not been disproven. Miners have been given bad advice.\r\n\r\n> setting an economically rational default wouldn't change it.\r\n\r\nOnly in the case that the default doesn't matter. In which case, the argument to change the default falls apart completely.\r\n\r\n> For example, there are many miners who have set the max size to a million bytes to override these broken defaults. And then with segwit they'll be producing undersized blocks unintentionally. \r\n\r\nIf they want 1 MB, then their configuration of 1 MB should get them 1 MB. *There is no such thing as undersized blocks.*\r\n\r\n> Setting a reduced default against the traffic in the network today violates the principle the software should act in the interest of the people using it and in doing so shows disrespect where none is intended,\r\n\r\nNo such principle has been established. Defaults should within reason be what is best for Bitcoin as a whole.\r\n\r\n> it violates the principle that absent significant harm to it users it should act in the public interest (by making fee estimation less reliable).\r\n\r\nFee estimation is an unrelated matter. If it can't handle a variety of block sizes, that's a bug in the estimation logic.\r\n\r\n> improvements in block propagation have largely eliminated size based considerations as legitimate reasons to choose to produce a smaller block.\r\n\r\nNo, they haven't. Block propagation has been \"solved\" by centralised relay networks (FIBRE) and SPV mining, both of which are harmful to the network and not real solutions. Additionally, the most bandwidth-contrained users run in `blocksonly` mode, which doesn't benefit from compact blocks or other such improvements. Furthermore, none of this addresses the issue of block*chain* size and IBD, at all.\r\n\r\nAgain, NACK.\r\n\r\n(Maybe #3229 can be reopened?)",

I wouldn't even bother with the deprecation step, I would go straight to removal and just document it in the release notes once.\r\nBut if we're going to maintain both simultaneously for any longer I agree the 2 constants for the defaults and forbidding using both at the same time (ie like you can't use -testnet and -regtest at once) is the less insane option.\r\nDo we have more examples of defaults depending on selections of other options?\r\nIf so, I think we should get rid of all of them independently of this PR.  \r\n\r\n> Miners have in recent years maxed out 1 MB. That is completely different from 4 MB, and does not prove they will increase to 4 MB immediately in any sense.\r\n\r\nI will treat any arguments regarding defaults as if they were arguments for a lower value for DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT, not as arguments for the removal/deprecation of blockmaxsize in itself.\r\nRegarding all those arguments, here's all I have to say: I trust miners to end up doing what's economically better for them, but I'm not opposed to a very low default for DEFAULT_BLOCK_MAX_WEIGHT. I think that will only prove that the default won't matter at all unless it's economically optimal or close: otherwise it'll be a few accidental bad blocks, perhaps the lower the default the faster they will read about the option. \r\nI'm also not opposed to saving the unnecessary disruption, since as others have argued that would only change their default to something unexpected.\r\n\r\nConcept ACK\r\n ",
