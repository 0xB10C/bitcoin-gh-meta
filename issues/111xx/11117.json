   "body" : "This patch removes the need for the intermediary Base58 type `CBitcoinAddress`, by providing {`Encode`,`Decode`,`IsValid`}`Destination` functions that directly operate on the conversion between `std::string`s and `CTxDestination`.\r\n\r\nThis change is far from complete. In follow-ups I'd like to:\r\n* Split off the specific address and key encoding logic from base58.h, and move it to a address.h or so.\r\n* Replace `CTxDestination` with a non-`boost::variant` version (which can be more efficient as `boost::variant` allocates everything on the heap, and remove the need for `boost::get<...>` and `IsValidDestination` calls everywhere).\r\n* Remove `CBitcoinAddress` entirely (it's currently still there, but only used for implementing the new wrapper functions).\r\n* Do the same for `CBitcoinSecret`, `CBitcoinExtKey`, and `CBitcoinExtPubKey`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've tried to keep this patch to be minimally invasive, but still enough to support non-Base58 addresses. Perhaps a smaller patch is possible to hack Bech32 support into `CBitcoinAddress`, but I would consider that a move in the wrong direction.\r\n",
