This patchset forces the user to set FORCE_USE_SYSTEM_CLANG=1 in order to use their system clang (when they know what they're doing)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI do need a better way to achieve a093faf7cc6c648ad9bd12f0bb749bfd10a7fedb, right now I just define another package `native_cctools-system-clang.mk` and switch the toolchain package based on `FORCE_USE_SYSTEM_CLANG`, which is ugly.",
