   "body" : "Combines the CentOS build with the 32-bit (i686) build to avoid Travis bottlenecks, as suggested in #17757 by MarcoFalke. This keeps most of the properties of the 32-bit build (dash as config shell, building QT5 GUI) and just builds it with depends inside the CentOS docker container.\r\n\r\nMaking the depends in `05_before_script.sh` with unset config shell (`CONFIG_SHELL=`) \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6196e930018181301b5972842ae384ea4288ff34/ci/test/05_before_script.sh#L28\r\n\r\ncaused problems for building the library libevent (resulting in a Makefile with no shell set (`SHELL=`)), that's why I set it explicitely to `/bin/bash` if we have a CentOS Docker container.\r\n\r\nA Travis output of this 32-bit CentOS build can be seen here: https://travis-ci.org/theStack/bitcoin/jobs/634472394 (has been restarted once due to too long build time and appearance of the `CACHE_ERR_MSG`).\r\n\r\nFor anyone wanting to verify the outputs, I found these instructions useful to reproduce a Travis build locally: https://github.com/erdc/proteus/wiki/Replicating-the-TravisCI-Environment-on-your-Local-Machine (steps 1-3). In this case it's a bit tricky since you run Docker inside Docker -- within the Travis Docker container, the CentOS Docker container is created. To make this possible, the Docker socket has to be exposed to the Travis container via bind-mounting (`docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ...`), as suggested in https://stackoverflow.com/a/33003273.",
