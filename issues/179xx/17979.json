It would be nice to consolidate it a bit. If you want to leave it to a follow-up though I am happy to merge this with the current ACKs.\r\n\r\nFrom [@promag](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17492#pullrequestreview-344327009):\r\n\r\n>     bumpFee should not be in the wallet model - could follow same approach as WalletControllerActivity - because IMO it's wrong to open message boxes (any GUI change) or copy to clipboard from a model class;\r\n\r\n>     bumpFee should be asynchronous - 1. above would help here - if from the GUI thread we hit cs_main or cs_wallet then that's bad;\r\n\r\n>     we keep adding nested event loops with QMessageBox helper functions - again 1. would help here.\r\n",
